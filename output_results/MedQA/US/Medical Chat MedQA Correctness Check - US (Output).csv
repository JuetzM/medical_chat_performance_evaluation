"A junior orthopaedic surgery resident is completing a carpal tunnel repair with the department chairman as the attending physician. During the case, the resident inadvertently cuts a flexor tendon. The tendon is repaired without complication. The attending tells the resident that the patient will do fine, and there is no need to report this minor complication that will not harm the patient, as he does not want to make the patient worry unnecessarily. He tells the resident to leave this complication out of the operative report. Which of the following is the correct next action for the resident to take?
Options:
(A): Disclose the error to the patient but leave it out of the operative report
(B): Disclose the error to the patient and put it in the operative report
(C): Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake
(D): Report the physician to the ethics committee
(E): Refuse to dictate the operative report
",Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Tell the attending that he cannot fail to disclose this mistake.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the attending physician is advising the resident to withhold information about a complication from the patient and exclude it from the operative report. However, it is important for the resident to prioritize patient safety and ethical responsibility.

Surgeons have a duty to communicate complications that result from surgical procedures, even if they are considered minor or do not harm the patient. The resident should inform the attending physician that they cannot fail to disclose this mistake to the patient. Open and honest communication with patients is essential for maintaining trust and ensuring patient autonomy.

By disclosing the error to the patient, the resident allows the patient to make informed decisions about their care and potential follow-up treatments. Additionally, including the complication in the operative report ensures accurate documentation of the procedure and any associated complications, which is important for future reference and potential legal purposes.

Reporting the physician to the ethics committee or refusing to dictate the operative report may not be necessary or appropriate actions in this situation. The resident should first address the issue with the attending physician and advocate for proper disclosure and documentation.",
"A 67-year-old man with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of ringing sensation in his ear. He received this first course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy 1 week ago. Pure tone audiometry shows a sensorineural hearing loss of 45 dB. The expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to which of the following actions?
Options:
(A): Inhibition of thymidine synthesis
(B): Inhibition of proteasome
(C): Hyperstabilization of microtubules
(D): Generation of free radicals
(E): Cross-linking of DNA
",Cross-linking of DNA,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Cross-linking of DNA.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of ringing sensation in the ear and sensorineural hearing loss are consistent with ototoxicity, which is a known side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs. The most common chemotherapy drug associated with ototoxicity is cisplatin, which is commonly used in the treatment of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

Cisplatin exerts its antitumor effects by cross-linking DNA, which leads to DNA damage and inhibition of DNA replication and transcription. However, this cross-linking of DNA can also affect normal cells, including the cells of the inner ear, leading to ototoxicity.

The symptoms of ototoxicity, such as ringing sensation in the ear and sensorineural hearing loss, are a result of damage to the hair cells in the cochlea, which are responsible for converting sound vibrations into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. The cross-linking of DNA by cisplatin can lead to damage and death of these hair cells, resulting in hearing loss.

Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the drug that caused this patient's symptoms is most likely due to its ability to cross-link DNA.",
"Two weeks after undergoing an emergency cardiac catherization with stenting for unstable angina pectoris, a 61-year-old man has decreased urinary output and malaise. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and osteoarthritis of the hips. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin and naproxen. He was also started on aspirin, clopidogrel, and metoprolol after the coronary intervention. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 93/min, and blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. Examination shows mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin count 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 56%
Eosinophils 11%
Lymphocytes 31%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 68 mm/h
Serum
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 4.2 mg/dL
Renal biopsy shows intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Renal papillary necrosis
(B): Allergic interstitial nephritis
(C): Cholesterol embolization
(D): Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis
(E): Polyarteritis nodosa
",Cholesterol embolization,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Cholesterol embolization.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including decreased urinary output and malaise, along with the laboratory findings of elevated serum creatinine and intravascular spindle-shaped vacuoles on renal biopsy, are consistent with cholesterol embolization syndrome. Cholesterol embolization occurs when atherosclerotic plaques in large arteries rupture, releasing cholesterol crystals into the bloodstream. These crystals can then lodge in small blood vessels, including those in the kidneys, leading to tissue ischemia and organ dysfunction.

The patient's history of undergoing cardiac catheterization with stenting is a risk factor for cholesterol embolization, as the procedure can disrupt atherosclerotic plaques. Additionally, the mottled, reticulated purplish discoloration of the feet, known as livedo reticularis, is a classic finding in cholesterol embolization syndrome.

The other answer choices are less likely based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings:
- Renal papillary necrosis (A) typically presents with gross hematuria and flank pain, which are not described in this patient.
- Allergic interstitial nephritis (B) typically presents with fever, rash, eosinophilia, and eosinophilic infiltrates on renal biopsy, which are not described in this patient.
- Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (D), formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome, typically presents with asthma, eosinophilia, and systemic vasculitis, which are not described in this patient.
- Polyarteritis nodosa (E) typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and myalgias, along with evidence of systemic vasculitis, which are not described in this patient.",
"A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of fevers, chills, and left lower quadrant pain. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 126/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is blood oozing around the site of a peripheral intravenous line. Pelvic examination shows mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness. Laboratory studies show:
Platelet count 14,200/mm3
Fibrinogen 83 mg/mL (N = 200–430 mg/dL)
D-dimer 965 ng/mL (N < 500 ng/mL)
When phenol is applied to a sample of the patient's blood at 90°C, a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain is identified. A blood culture is most likely to show which of the following?""
Options:
(A): Coagulase-positive, gram-positive cocci forming mauve-colored colonies on methicillin-containing agar
(B): Encapsulated, gram-negative coccobacilli forming grey-colored colonies on charcoal blood agar
(C): Spore-forming, gram-positive bacilli forming yellow colonies on casein agar
(D): Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar
(E): Gamma-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci forming green colonies on vancomycin agar
","Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar",Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. The presence of mucopurulent discharge from the cervical os and left adnexal tenderness supports this diagnosis.

The laboratory findings are also suggestive of an infection. The low platelet count (14,200/mm3) and fibrinogen level (83 mg/mL) indicate disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which can occur in severe infections. The elevated D-dimer level (965 ng/mL) further supports the presence of DIC.

The phenol test is used to identify the presence of endotoxins, which are lipopolysaccharides found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. The identification of a phosphorylated N-acetylglucosamine dimer with 6 fatty acids attached to a polysaccharide side chain suggests the presence of endotoxins from gram-negative bacteria.

The most likely gram-negative bacteria causing the infection in this patient is Escherichia coli, which is a common cause of PID. E. coli is a lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod that can be identified by its ability to ferment lactose and form pink colonies on MacConkey agar.

Therefore, the blood culture is most likely to show lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rods forming pink colonies on MacConkey agar.",
"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of itchy, watery eyes for the past week. He has also been sneezing multiple times a day during this period. He had a similar episode 1 year ago around springtime. He has iron deficiency anemia and ankylosing spondylitis. Current medications include ferrous sulfate, artificial tear drops, and indomethacin. He works as an elementary school teacher. His vital signs are within normal limits. Visual acuity is 20/20 without correction. Physical examination shows bilateral conjunctival injection with watery discharge. The pupils are 3 mm, equal, and reactive to light. Examination of the anterior chamber of the eye is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?
Options:
(A): Erythromycin ointment
(B): Ketotifen eye drops
(C): Warm compresses
(D): Fluorometholone eye drops
(E): Latanoprost eye drops
",Ketotifen eye drops,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Ketotifen eye drops.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is allergic conjunctivitis. Allergic conjunctivitis is characterized by bilateral conjunctival injection, watery discharge, and itching. The patient's history of similar symptoms in the past, as well as his current symptoms of sneezing, further support this diagnosis.

The most appropriate treatment for allergic conjunctivitis is anti-allergy eye drops. Ketotifen is an antihistamine that can be used as eye drops to relieve the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. It is effective in reducing itching, redness, and watery discharge. Ketotifen eye drops can be bought without a prescription and are a suitable first-line treatment for mild cases of allergic conjunctivitis.

Erythromycin ointment (choice A) is an antibiotic and is not indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. It would not address the underlying allergic inflammation.

Warm compresses (choice C) can provide symptomatic relief for some types of conjunctivitis, such as viral or bacterial conjunctivitis, but they are not the most appropriate treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.

Fluorometholone eye drops (choice D) and latanoprost eye drops (choice E) are not indicated for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Fluorometholone is a corticosteroid eye drop that has more potent anti-inflammatory effects and is typically reserved for more severe cases or when other treatments have failed. Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog used to treat glaucoma and is not indicated for allergic conjunctivitis.",
"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of progressively worsening chest pain and nausea that started at a local bar 30 minutes prior. The pain radiates to the epigastric area. He has a 5-year history of untreated hypertension. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 5 years and started abusing cocaine 2 weeks before his emergency room visit. The patient is diaphoretic and in marked distress. What should be the first step in management?
Options:
(A): Diltiazem
(B): Labetalol
(C): Nitroglycerin
(D): Propranolol
(E): Reassurance and continuous monitoring
",Reassurance and continuous monitoring,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Reassurance and continuous monitoring.

Explanation:
Given the patient's symptoms of chest pain radiating to the epigastric area, along with the risk factors of untreated hypertension, smoking, and recent cocaine abuse, the most likely diagnosis is acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In this scenario, the first step in management should be to provide reassurance to the patient and initiate continuous monitoring.

Reassurance is important to help alleviate the patient's distress and anxiety. Continuous monitoring allows for the assessment of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation, which can provide important information about the patient's condition and guide further management.

Administering medications such as Diltiazem, Labetalol, Nitroglycerin, or Propranolol without a proper evaluation and diagnosis can be potentially harmful and may delay appropriate treatment. Therefore, the initial focus should be on reassurance and continuous monitoring while further evaluation and diagnostic tests, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes, are performed to confirm the diagnosis of ACS and guide subsequent management.",
"A 68-year-old male comes to the physician for evaluation of right flank pain. He has a history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease. His blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness. An ultrasound shows dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Renal artery stenosis
(B): Benign prostatic hyperplasia
(C): Diabetic nephropathy
(D): Common iliac artery aneurysm
(E): Urethral stricture
",Common iliac artery aneurysm,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Common iliac artery aneurysm.

Explanation:
The patient's history of diabetes and peripheral artery disease, along with the physical examination findings of abdominal tenderness and right flank tenderness, suggest a vascular cause for his symptoms. The ultrasound findings of dilation of the right ureter and renal pelvis further support this suspicion. Common iliac artery aneurysm is a likely underlying cause in this patient, as it can lead to compression or obstruction of the ureter and renal pelvis, resulting in flank pain and dilation of the urinary tract. Renal artery stenosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, diabetic nephropathy, and urethral stricture are less likely to cause these specific findings.",
"A 65-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after the onset of acute chest pain. He has hypertension and asthma. Current medications include atorvastatin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His pulse is 114/min and blood pressure is 130/88 mm Hg. An ECG shows ST-segment depressions in leads II, III, and aVF. Laboratory studies show an increased serum troponin T concentration. The patient is treated for acute coronary syndrome and undergoes percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. At the time of discharge, echocardiography shows a left ventricular ejection fraction of 58%. In addition to aspirin, which of the following drugs should be added to this patient's medication regimen?
Options:
(A): Nifedipine
(B): Enoxaparin
(C): Clopidogrel
(D): Spironolactone
(E): Propranolol
""
",Clopidogrel,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Clopidogrel.

Explanation:
Clopidogrel is a platelet inhibitor that is commonly used in the management of acute coronary syndrome. It works by inhibiting the ADP receptor on platelets, preventing platelet aggregation and reducing the risk of thrombotic events. In this patient with acute coronary syndrome, adding clopidogrel to his medication regimen will further reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.

Nifedipine (A) is a calcium channel blocker that is primarily used for the treatment of hypertension and angina. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient with acute coronary syndrome.

Enoxaparin (B) is a low molecular weight heparin that is commonly used for anticoagulation in patients with acute coronary syndrome. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient with acute coronary syndrome.

Spironolactone (D) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is primarily used for the treatment of heart failure. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient with acute coronary syndrome.

Propranolol (E) is a beta-blocker that is commonly used for the treatment of hypertension and angina. While it may be beneficial in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient with acute coronary syndrome.",
"A 37-year-old-woman presents to her primary care physician requesting a new form of birth control. She has been utilizing oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for the past 8 years, but asks to switch to an intrauterine device (IUD). Her vital signs are: blood pressure 118/78 mm Hg, pulse 73/min and respiratory rate 16/min. She is afebrile. Physical examination is within normal limits. Which of the following past medical history statements would make copper IUD placement contraindicated in this patient?
Options:
(A): A history of stroke or venous thromboembolism
(B): Current tobacco use
(C): Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
(D): Past medical history of breast cancer
(E): Known liver neoplasm
",Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID),Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

Explanation:
Active or recurrent pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a contraindication for copper IUD placement. PID is an infection of the female reproductive organs, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It is usually caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as chlamydia or gonorrhea. The presence of active or recurrent PID increases the risk of complications with IUD placement, such as worsening infection or spreading of the infection to other parts of the reproductive system. Therefore, it is not recommended to place a copper IUD in a patient with active or recurrent PID.",
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because she is embarrassed about the appearance of her nails. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. She appears well. A photograph of the nails is shown. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?
Options:
(A): Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces
(B): Flesh-colored papules in the lumbosacral region
(C): Erosions of the dental enamel
(D): Pallor of the conjunctival mucosa
(E): Holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
",Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces.

Explanation:
The photograph of the nails shows pitting and onycholysis, which are characteristic findings of psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that primarily affects the skin and nails. Silvery plaques on extensor surfaces, such as the elbows and knees, are classic findings in psoriasis. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be silvery plaques on extensor surfaces. Psoriasis can also affect other areas of the body, including the scalp, trunk, and nails. It is important to note that psoriasis can vary in severity and may be associated with joint pain and swelling (psoriatic arthritis) in some cases. However, the question does not provide any information about joint symptoms, so the most likely finding to be associated with psoriasis in this patient is silvery plaques on extensor surfaces.",
"A 24-year-old G2P1 woman at 39 weeks’ gestation presents to the emergency department complaining of painful contractions occurring every 10 minutes for the past 2 hours, consistent with latent labor. She says she has not experienced vaginal discharge, bleeding, or fluid leakage, and is currently taking no medications. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 86/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). She has had little prenatal care and uses condoms inconsistently. Her sexually transmitted infections status is unknown. As part of the patient’s workup, she undergoes a series of rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery. The infant is also given zidovudine to reduce the risk of transmission. A confirmatory test is then performed in the mother to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. Which of the following is most true about the confirmatory test?
Options:
(A): It determines the genotype of the virus
(B): It is a Southwestern blot, identifying the presence of DNA-binding proteins
(C): It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of RNA
(D): It is a Northern blot, identifying the presence of DNA
(E): It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay
",It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) It is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient undergoes rapid screening tests that result in the administration of zidovudine during delivery, indicating a positive result for HIV. A confirmatory test is then performed to confirm the diagnosis of HIV. The most appropriate confirmatory test in this case is an HIV-1/HIV2 antibody differentiation immunoassay.

The confirmatory test is used to differentiate between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. HIV-1 is the most common type of HIV infection worldwide, while HIV-2 is less common and primarily found in West Africa. The confirmatory test helps determine the specific type of HIV infection the patient has.

Options A, B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the purpose or method of the confirmatory test for HIV. The confirmatory test does not determine the genotype of the virus (Option A), use a Southwestern blot to identify DNA-binding proteins (Option B), use a Northern blot to identify RNA (Option C), or use a Northern blot to identify DNA (Option D).",
"A 72-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue and worsening abdominal pain. During this period, he also has excessive night sweats and shortness of breath on exertion. Over the past 3 months, he has had a 5.6-kg (12-lb) weight loss. He had a myocardial infarction 3 years ago. He has hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic bronchitis. His medications include insulin, aspirin, lisinopril, and an albuterol inhaler. He has smoked half a pack of cigarettes for the past 45 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. The spleen is palpated 6 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 6.4 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 85 μm3
Leukocyte count 5,200/mm3
Platelet count 96,000/mm3
A blood smear is shown. Bone marrow aspiration shows extensive fibrosis and a few scattered plasma cells. A JAK 2 assay is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Cladribine
(B): Prednisone
(C): Imatinib
(D): Ruxolitinib
(E): Stem cell transplantation
",Ruxolitinib,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Ruxolitinib.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by bone marrow fibrosis, resulting in cytopenias and extramedullary hematopoiesis. The JAK2 mutation is commonly associated with myelofibrosis.

Ruxolitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor that has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce spleen size in patients with myelofibrosis. It is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.

Cladribine (A) is a purine analog that is used in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, not myelofibrosis.

Prednisone (B) is a corticosteroid that may be used in the treatment of autoimmune disorders and certain hematologic malignancies, but it is not the first-line treatment for myelofibrosis.

Imatinib (C) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not myelofibrosis.

Stem cell transplantation (E) may be considered in younger patients with myelofibrosis who have a suitable donor, but it is not the first-line treatment option for this patient.",
"A 20-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening gait unsteadiness and bilateral hearing loss for 1 month. He has had intermittent tingling sensations on both cheeks over this time period. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Audiometry shows bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic evaluation shows a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Renal cell carcinoma
(B): Meningioma
(C): Astrocytoma
(D): Vascular malformations
(E): Telangiectasias
",Meningioma,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Meningioma.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of gait unsteadiness, bilateral hearing loss, and tingling sensations on both cheeks, along with the genetic evaluation showing a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 22 that encodes merlin, are consistent with a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF2 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple tumors in the nervous system, particularly in the central nervous system. Meningiomas are one of the most common tumors associated with NF2, occurring in up to 70% of cases. Therefore, this patient is at increased risk for developing meningiomas. Renal cell carcinoma, astrocytoma, vascular malformations, and telangiectasias are not typically associated with NF2.",
"A 47-year-old executive schedules an appointment his physician for a routine medical check-up. He currently has no complaints and claims to be “as fit as a fiddle.” The physical examination findings are unremarkable, except for a mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. The physician instructs the patient to stand from a supine position with the stethoscope still placed on his chest. Which of the following changes would occur with this maneuver?
Options:
(A): An increase in right atrial pressure
(B): An increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
(C): An increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
(D): A reduction in the slope of the pacemaker potential
(E): A reduction in diastolic filling time
",A reduction in diastolic filling time,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.

Explanation:
When a person stands up from a supine position, there is a shift of blood volume from the thoracic cavity to the lower extremities due to the effect of gravity. This results in a decrease in venous return to the heart. As a result, there is a reduction in diastolic filling time, which is the time during which the ventricles fill with blood. 

This reduction in diastolic filling time leads to a decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure. This decrease in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is reflected in a decrease in the intensity of the mid-systolic murmur heard in the 2nd left intercostal space that radiates to the carotids on auscultation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) A reduction in diastolic filling time.",
"A microbiologist is studying the emergence of a virulent strain of the virus. After a detailed study of the virus and its life cycle, he proposes a theory: Initially, a host cell is co-infected with 2 viruses from the same virus family. Within the host cell, concomitant production of various genome segments from both viruses occurs. Ultimately, the different genome segments from the viruses are packaged into a unique and novel virus particle. The newly formed virus particle is both stable and viable and is a new strain from the virus family that caused the outbreak of infection. Which of the following viruses is capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process?
Options:
(A): Cytomegalovirus
(B): Epstein-Barr virus
(C): Human immunodeficiency virus
(D): Rotavirus
(E): Vaccinia virus
",Rotavirus,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Rotavirus.

Explanation:
According to the given information, the process described involves the co-infection of a host cell with two viruses from the same virus family, followed by the production of various genome segments from both viruses within the host cell. These different genome segments are then packaged into a unique and novel virus particle, which is stable and viable and represents a new strain from the virus family.

Among the given options, rotavirus is the most likely virus to undergo this process. Rotavirus is a double-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Reoviridae family. It is known to have a segmented genome, with 11 segments of RNA. This segmented genome allows for the exchange and recombination of genetic material during co-infection, leading to the production of novel virus particles with unique combinations of genome segments.

In contrast, the other options (A) Cytomegalovirus, (B) Epstein-Barr virus, (C) Human immunodeficiency virus, and (E) Vaccinia virus do not have segmented genomes and are less likely to undergo the described process of co-infection and recombination of genome segments.

Therefore, the most likely virus capable of undergoing the above-mentioned process is (D) Rotavirus.",
"A 59-year-old overweight woman presents to the urgent care clinic with the complaint of severe abdominal pain for the past 2 hours. She also complains of a dull pain in her back with nausea and vomiting several times. Her pain has no relation with food. Her past medical history is significant for recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis. Her father died at the age of 60 with some form of abdominal cancer. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical exam is unremarkable. However, a CT scan of the abdomen shows a calcified mass near her gallbladder. Which of the following diagnoses should be excluded first in this patient?
Options:
(A): Acute cholecystitis
(B): Gallbladder cancer
(C): Choledocholithiasis
(D): Pancreatitis
(E): Duodenal peptic ulcer
",Gallbladder cancer,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Gallbladder cancer.

Explanation:
In this patient, the presence of a calcified mass near the gallbladder on CT scan raises concern for gallbladder cancer. The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, dull back pain, nausea, and vomiting are concerning for a serious underlying condition. The fact that the pain is not related to food and the patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain due to cholelithiasis further raises suspicion for gallbladder cancer. Additionally, the patient's family history of abdominal cancer, specifically her father's death at the age of 60, is also concerning for a hereditary component. Therefore, gallbladder cancer should be excluded first in this patient. Acute cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis, pancreatitis, and duodenal peptic ulcer are all possible differential diagnoses, but gallbladder cancer should be the primary concern given the clinical presentation and imaging findings.",
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study?
Options:
(A): IL-5
(B): IL-2
(C): IL-10
(D): IL-13
(E): IL-4
",IL-4,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) IL-4.

Explanation:
In this experimental study, the targeted mediator is described as favoring the class switching of antibodies. This indicates that the mediator is involved in the production of IgE antibodies, which play a key role in allergic reactions, including asthma. IL-4 is known to induce B-cell proliferation and stimulate these cells to produce IgE. Therefore, reducing the activity of IL-4 will decrease the production of IgE antibodies, leading to a reduction in the exaggerated response observed during asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. IL-5, IL-2, IL-10, and IL-13 are not directly involved in the class switching of antibodies and do not have the same impact on IgE production as IL-4.",
"A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study?
Options:
(A): Stratified analysis
(B): Blinding
(C): Restriction
(D): Randomization
(E): Matching
",Matching,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Matching.

Explanation:
Matching is a method used to control confounding bias in a study. In this case, the pediatrician recruited 75 infants with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE, and matched them based on age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. By matching the two groups, the pediatrician ensured that these potential confounders were evenly distributed between the groups, reducing the likelihood of bias. This allows for a more accurate comparison of the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Matching is an effective method to control for confounding variables and improve the internal validity of a study.",
"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to central chest pain over the past 3 days which is constant and unrelated to exertion. The pain is sharp, severe, increases when lying down, and improves with leaning forward. The pain also radiates to his shoulders and neck. The patient has no past medical history. He has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 7 years and occasionally drinks alcohol. He presents with vital signs: blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, regular radial pulse of 95/min, and temperature 37.3°C (99.1°F). On physical exam, a scratching sound of to-and-from character is audible over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward. His chest X-ray is normal and ECG is shown in the picture. Which of the following is the optimal therapy for this patient?
Options:
(A): Indomethacin +/- omeprazole
(B): Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole
(C): Prednisone + colchicine
(D): Pericardiocentesis
(E): Pericardiectomy
",Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Ibuprofen + colchicine +/- omeprazole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute pericarditis. The sharp, severe chest pain that increases when lying down and improves with leaning forward is a classic symptom of pericarditis. The radiation of pain to the shoulders and neck is also consistent with pericarditis.

The scratching sound of to-and-fro character heard over the left sternal border at end-expiration with the patient leaning forward is known as a pericardial friction rub, which is another characteristic finding of pericarditis.

The ECG shown in the picture may show diffuse ST-segment elevations and PR-segment depressions, which are also typical findings in acute pericarditis.

The optimal therapy for acute pericarditis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, along with colchicine. NSAIDs help reduce inflammation and relieve pain, while colchicine helps prevent recurrences of pericarditis.

Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, may be added to the treatment regimen to prevent gastrointestinal side effects from NSAIDs.

Indomethacin (option A) is an NSAID that can be used for pericarditis, but ibuprofen is a more commonly used and preferred option.

Prednisone (option C) is a corticosteroid that may be used in refractory cases of pericarditis, but it is not the first-line treatment.

Pericardiocentesis (option D) is a procedure used to drain fluid from the pericardial sac in cases of cardiac tamponade or purulent pericarditis. It is not indicated in the management of acute pericarditis.

Pericardiectomy (option E) is a surgical procedure to remove the pericardium and is reserved for cases of chronic or recurrent pericarditis that do not respond to medical therapy. It is not the initial treatment for acute pericarditis.",
"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for evaluation of altered mental status. He was found on the floor in front of his apartment. He is somnolent but responsive when aroused. His pulse is 64/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and blood pressure is 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, an alcoholic smell and slurred speech are noted. Neurological exam shows diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally and an ataxic gait. His pupils are normal. Blood alcohol concentration is 0.04%. An ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Hypoglycemia
(B): Cerebral ischemia
(C): Ethanol intoxication
(D): Cannabis intoxication
(E): Benzodiazepine intoxication
""
","Benzodiazepine intoxication
""",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Benzodiazepine intoxication.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and the information provided, the most likely cause of his symptoms is benzodiazepine intoxication. The patient has an altered mental status, somnolence, slurred speech, and an ataxic gait, which are all consistent with the central nervous system depressant effects of benzodiazepines. The presence of an alcoholic smell suggests that the patient may have consumed alcohol, but the blood alcohol concentration of 0.04% is relatively low and unlikely to be the sole cause of his symptoms. Additionally, the normal pupils and absence of abnormalities on the ECG make other options less likely. Hypoglycemia can cause altered mental status, but the patient's blood glucose level is not provided and there are no other signs or symptoms to suggest hypoglycemia. Cerebral ischemia would typically present with focal neurological deficits, such as weakness or sensory loss, which are not described in this patient. Cannabis intoxication can cause altered mental status, but it is less likely given the patient's presentation and the absence of other typical signs and symptoms. Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is benzodiazepine intoxication.",
"A 77-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with the complaints of fever, malaise, and night sweats. She recently observed an enlargement of her axillary lymph nodes, which she examines on a weekly basis. She has a remote history of breast cancer in her 60s that was treated with radiation and chemotherapy. She also reports a history of extensive travel to Africa and a 30-pack-year history of smoking. On physical exam, several axillary lymph nodes are palpable with a large non-tender palpable mass in her right axilla measuring 10 x 8 cm. Fine-needle aspiration demonstrates what the pathologist describes as ""a centroblastic and immunoblastic cell presence, suspicious for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL)–diffuse large B cell variant"". Which of the following risk factors is responsible for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Travel to Africa
(B): Axillary lymph node involvement
(C): Previous radiation therapy
(D): Female gender
(E): Previous breast cancer
",Previous radiation therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Previous radiation therapy.

Explanation:
The patient's history of previous radiation therapy for breast cancer is the most significant risk factor for her current condition of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Radiation therapy is a known risk factor for the development of secondary malignancies, including lymphomas. The fact that the patient has a large mass in her axilla, along with the presence of centroblastic and immunoblastic cells on fine-needle aspiration, is consistent with NHL. The other options, such as travel to Africa, axillary lymph node involvement, female gender, and previous breast cancer, are not directly associated with the development of NHL in this case.",
"A 3-month-old infant is brought to her pediatrician because she coughs and seems to have difficulty breathing while feeding. In addition, she seems to have less energy compared to other babies and appears listless throughout the day. She was born by cesarean section to a G1P1 woman with no prior medical history and had a normal APGAR score at birth. Her parents say that she has never been observed to turn blue. Physical exam reveals a high-pitched holosystolic murmur that is best heard at the lower left sternal border. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following abnormalities?
Options:
(A): 22q11 deletion
(B): Deletion of genes on chromosome 7
(C): Lithium exposure in utero
(D): Maternal alcohol consumption
(E): Retinoic acid exposure in utero
",22q11 deletion,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) 22q11 deletion.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the scenario, including coughing, difficulty breathing while feeding, decreased energy, and a high-pitched holosystolic murmur, are consistent with a congenital heart defect. The most likely cause of these symptoms in this patient is a 22q11 deletion, also known as DiGeorge syndrome or velocardiofacial syndrome.

DiGeorge syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 22. This deletion can result in a variety of abnormalities, including congenital heart defects, immune system dysfunction, and facial abnormalities. The high-pitched holosystolic murmur heard on physical exam is likely due to a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is a common cardiac anomaly associated with 22q11 deletion.

The other options listed (B, C, D, and E) are not associated with the characteristic symptoms and findings described in the scenario. Deletion of genes on chromosome 7, lithium exposure in utero, maternal alcohol consumption, and retinoic acid exposure in utero are not typically associated with congenital heart defects or the specific clinical presentation described in this patient.",
"A 30-year-old African American woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a dry cough and chest discomfort for the past 3 days. During this period, the patient has had headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills. Ten days ago, she was hiking with her family in Mississippi. The patient has asthma that is treated with an albuterol inhaler. Her mother has a lung disease treated with methotrexate. The patient has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 10 years. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F). Physical examination shows slight wheezes throughout both lung fields. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are positive for polysaccharide antigen. Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Legionella pneumophila infection
(B): Aspergillus fumigatus infection
(C): Pneumocystis pneumonia
(D): Histoplasma capsulatum infection
(E): Blastomyces dermatitidis infection
",Histoplasma capsulatum infection,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Histoplasma capsulatum infection.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including dry cough, chest discomfort, headaches, muscle aches, joint pain, fever, and chills, along with the history of hiking in Mississippi, are suggestive of a fungal infection. The presence of slight wheezes throughout both lung fields on physical examination further supports a respiratory infection. The positive polysaccharide antigen in the laboratory studies and urinalysis indicates the presence of a fungal infection.

Bronchoalveolar lavage using silver/PAS-staining shows macrophages filled with a dimorphic fungus with septate hyphae. This finding is characteristic of Histoplasma capsulatum infection. Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that exists as a mold in the environment and as a yeast in the host. It is commonly found in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings, and inhalation of the spores can lead to infection.

The patient's asthma and smoking history may increase her risk of developing a fungal infection. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory condition that can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to infections. Smoking also impairs the immune system and damages the respiratory epithelium, making it easier for pathogens to enter the lungs.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, exposure history, laboratory findings, and bronchoalveolar lavage results, the most likely cause of her symptoms is a Histoplasma capsulatum infection.",
"A 62-year-old patient has been hospitalized for a week due to a stroke. One week into the hospitalization, he develops a fever and purulent cough. His vitals include: heart rate 88/min, respiratory rate 20/min, temperature 38.4°C (101.1°F), and blood pressure 110/85 mm Hg. On physical examination, he has basal crackles on the right side of the chest. Chest radiography shows a new consolidation on the same side. Complete blood count is as follows:
Hemoglobin 16 mg/dL
Hematocrit 50%
Leukocyte count 8,900/mm3
Neutrophils 72%
Bands 4%
Eosinophils 2%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 17%
Monocytes 5%
Platelet count 280,000/mm3
What is the most likely causal microorganism?
Options:
(A): Pseudomona aeruginosa
(B): Streptococcus pneumoniae
(C): Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(D): Haemophilus influenzae
(E): Staphylococcus aureus
",Staphylococcus aureus,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Staphylococcus aureus.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely causal microorganism in this case is Staphylococcus aureus. 

The patient has developed a fever and purulent cough, which are suggestive of a respiratory infection. The presence of basal crackles on the right side of the chest and a new consolidation on chest radiography further support the diagnosis of a lower respiratory tract infection.

The complete blood count shows an elevated leukocyte count with a predominance of neutrophils (72%) and bands (4%). This indicates an acute bacterial infection, as neutrophils are the primary cells involved in the body's defense against bacterial pathogens. The presence of bands, which are immature neutrophils, suggests an ongoing infection.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and can also cause healthcare-associated pneumonia. It is known to cause lung infections with purulent sputum and can lead to lung abscesses or empyema. The patient's hospitalization for a week increases the likelihood of healthcare-associated pneumonia.

While other microorganisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, can also cause pneumonia, the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this case are more consistent with Staphylococcus aureus infection. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is unlikely in this case as the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are suggestive of an acute infection rather than a chronic tuberculosis infection.",
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother for worsening wheezing and shortness of breath over the past day. He has not had a fever, cough, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has asthma and eczema. He uses a glucocorticoid inhaler and an albuterol inhaler but has missed his medications for the past week while on vacation. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 120/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 100/80. Expiratory and inspiratory wheezing is heard throughout both lung fields. There are moderate intercostal and subcostal retractions and a decreased inspiratory to expiratory ratio. Nebulized albuterol and ipratropium treatments and intravenous methylprednisolone are given in the emergency department for a presumed asthma exacerbation. One hour later, the child is limp and lethargic. Magnesium sulfate is administered. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 150/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 100/70. No wheezing is heard on repeat pulmonary examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Intubate with mechanical ventilation
(B): Perform needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space
(C): Perform bronchoscopy
(D): Provide helium and oxygen mixture
(E): Provide additional dose of methylprednisolone
",Intubate with mechanical ventilation,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Intubate with mechanical ventilation.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is experiencing a severe asthma exacerbation that has not responded to initial treatment with nebulized albuterol, ipratropium, and intravenous methylprednisolone. The child is now limp and lethargic, with a high heart rate and decreased respiratory rate. These signs indicate impending respiratory failure and the need for immediate intervention.

Intubation with mechanical ventilation is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Intubation will secure the airway and allow for the delivery of positive pressure ventilation, which can help improve oxygenation and ventilation in patients with severe respiratory distress or failure. It also allows for the administration of medications directly into the lungs, such as continuous nebulized albuterol.

Performing a needle thoracostomy at the 2nd intercostal space (B) is not indicated in this patient. Needle thoracostomy is performed to relieve tension pneumothorax, which is not suggested by the clinical presentation in this case.

Performing bronchoscopy (C) is not indicated as the next step in management for this patient. Bronchoscopy is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for cases where there is suspicion of a foreign body or other anatomical obstruction in the airway.

Providing a helium and oxygen mixture (D) is not indicated in this patient. Helium-oxygen mixtures, also known as heliox, can be used in patients with severe airway obstruction to reduce airway resistance and improve gas flow. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of severe airway obstruction.

Providing an additional dose of methylprednisolone (E) is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The patient has already received intravenous methylprednisolone, and the lack of response to this treatment suggests the need for more aggressive intervention, such as intubation and mechanical ventilation.",
"A 5-year-old female suffers from recurrent infections by Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's neutrophils are examined in the laboratory and they fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium test. Which of the following is most likely dysfunctional in this patient?
Options:
(A): Lymphocytes
(B): Immunoglobulin class switching
(C): Superoxide dismutase
(D): Myeloperoxidase
(E): Respiratory burst
",Respiratory burst,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Respiratory burst.

Explanation:
The patient's neutrophils fail to react during the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test, which is used to measure the respiratory burst activity of phagocytic cells. The respiratory burst is the process by which phagocytic cells, such as neutrophils, generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill pathogens. In this case, the patient's neutrophils are unable to produce oxygen radicals during phagocytosis, indicating a dysfunction in the respiratory burst.

The respiratory burst is an essential component of the innate immune response and is crucial for the killing of bacteria and fungi. Defects in the respiratory burst can lead to recurrent infections, particularly with organisms such as Aspergillus species, Pseudomonas species, and Staphylococcus aureus, which are commonly encountered in patients with impaired phagocyte function.

The other options are not likely to be dysfunctional in this patient:
(A) Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes are not directly involved in the respiratory burst and are not responsible for the patient's recurrent infections.
(B) Immunoglobulin class switching: Immunoglobulin class switching is a process that occurs in B cells and is involved in the production of different classes of antibodies. It is not directly related to the respiratory burst or phagocytic cell function.
(C) Superoxide dismutase: Superoxide dismutase is an enzyme that helps to neutralize superoxide radicals produced during the respiratory burst. Dysfunction of superoxide dismutase would not directly lead to a failure of neutrophils to react during the NBT test.
(D) Myeloperoxidase: Myeloperoxidase is an enzyme found in neutrophils that is involved in the production of reactive oxygen species. However, dysfunction of myeloperoxidase would not directly lead to a failure of neutrophils to react during the NBT test.",
"A 3-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with a ‘cough-like-a-seal bark’ and a high-pitched inspiratory noise that is audible without a stethoscope. His mother reports that his cough has worsened over the last few hours. The patient's blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg, pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 35/min, and temperature is 38.3°C (101.1°F). On physical examination, the boy is sitting and leaning forward in apparent respiratory distress with suprasternal and intercostal retractions. Auscultation reveals inspiratory stridor without wheezing. He has a frequent barking cough and a hoarse voice when he speaks. What is a chest X-ray likely to show?
Options:
(A): Diffuse streaky infiltrates
(B): Increased interstitial markings
(C): Lobar consolidation in the lingual
(D): Thumbprint sign on the lateral image
(E): Steeple sign
",Steeple sign,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Steeple sign.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the 3-year-old boy presents with a ""cough-like-a-seal bark"" and a high-pitched inspiratory noise audible without a stethoscope. He also has suprasternal and intercostal retractions, inspiratory stridor, and a hoarse voice. These symptoms are consistent with croup, which is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway, particularly the larynx and trachea.

A chest X-ray in croup is not typically necessary for diagnosis, but it may be done to rule out other causes or complications. The characteristic finding on a chest X-ray in croup is the ""steeple sign."" This refers to symmetric narrowing of the supraglottic airway, resembling the shape of a steeple. The steeple sign is caused by edema and inflammation of the larynx and trachea.

Therefore, a chest X-ray in this 3-year-old boy with croup is likely to show the steeple sign, which is the narrowing of the supraglottic airway.",
"A 26-year-old woman presents to a gynecologist after a missed period. After performing a complete physical examination and a screening test for pregnancy, her gynecologist informs her that she is pregnant. She is very surprised as she has been taking oral contraceptives regularly. When the gynecologist asks her about the consumption of any other medications, she mentions that she was placed on treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) 2 months ago. Her current anti-TB regimen includes rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the failure of oral contraceptives in this patient?
Options:
(A): Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone
(B): Induction of CYP2A6 by rifampin leading to increased inactivation of ethinylestradiol
(C): Induction of CYP2E1 by isoniazid leading to decreased serum levels of progesterone
(D): Interference with the intestinal absorption of the oral contraceptive by pyrazinamide
(E): Increased renal elimination of the progesterone component of the oral contraceptive by ethambutol
",Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leading to decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone.

Explanation:
Rifampin, one of the medications in the patient's anti-TB regimen, is a potent inducer of hepatic metabolism. It specifically induces the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4, which is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs, including oral contraceptives. Induction of CYP3A4 by rifampin leads to increased metabolism and decreased serum levels of ethinylestradiol and progesterone, the active components of oral contraceptives. This can result in decreased contraceptive efficacy and failure of oral contraceptives. It is important for healthcare providers to counsel patients on the potential drug interactions between rifampin and oral contraceptives and recommend alternative methods of contraception during TB treatment.",
"A 4-year-old previously healthy boy presents with 4 days of intermittent vomiting and 5-6 daily loose stools. His mother noted bloody stools and decreased oral intake of food and water over the last 24 hours. He is normally in daycare; however, he has been home for the past 3 days. On physical exam his temperature is 102.2°F (39°C), blood pressure is 140/90 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 22/min and O2 saturation is 99% on room air. He has dry mucous membranes. On abdominal exam you note diffuse tenderness to palpation without rebound or guarding. There are no masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Ultrasound of the right lower quadrant is negative for appendicitis. Stool is guaiac positive. He receives 15mg/kg acetaminophen and fluids are started. The next day, he complains of lower extremity weakness and tingling. On repeat exam, lower extremity strength is 3/5 with diminished patellar deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following lab findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Gram stain positive CSF
(B): Peripheral eosinophilia
(C): Xanthochromia on cerebrospinal fluid analysis
(D): Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count
(E): Oligoclonal bands on cerebrospinal fluid analysis
",Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein with normal cell count.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. GBS is often preceded by an infection, such as a gastrointestinal or respiratory infection, which can trigger an autoimmune response leading to inflammation and demyelination of peripheral nerves. The patient's symptoms of lower extremity weakness and tingling, along with diminished deep tendon reflexes, are characteristic of GBS.

In GBS, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis typically shows an increased protein level with a normal cell count. This is known as albuminocytologic dissociation and is a hallmark finding in GBS. The increased protein level is due to the breakdown of myelin in the peripheral nerves, leading to an influx of protein into the CSF. The normal cell count indicates that there is no significant inflammation in the CSF.

The other options are not consistent with the presentation of GBS. Gram stain positive CSF is more suggestive of bacterial meningitis, which would typically present with fever, neck stiffness, and altered mental status. Peripheral eosinophilia is seen in parasitic infections or allergic reactions, but it is not a characteristic finding in GBS. Xanthochromia on CSF analysis is seen in subarachnoid hemorrhage, not GBS. Oligoclonal bands on CSF analysis are seen in multiple sclerosis, which presents with a different set of symptoms and findings compared to GBS.",
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of an inward turning of his left forefoot. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation by cesarean section because of breech presentation. The pregnancy was complicated by oligohydramnios. Examination shows concavity of the medial border of the left foot with a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the left foot is convex. The heel is in neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the left foot shows an increased angle between the 1st and 2nd metatarsal bones. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Foot abduction brace
(B): Osteotomy of the metatarsals
(C): Arthrodesis of the forefoot
(D): Reassurance
(E): Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy
",Reassurance,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Reassurance.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the newborn has a positional deformity known as metatarsus adductus. Metatarsus adductus is characterized by inward turning of the forefoot, concavity of the medial border of the foot, and a skin crease just below the ball of the great toe. The lateral border of the foot is convex. The heel is in a neutral position. Tickling the lateral border of the foot leads to correction of the deformity, indicating that it is a flexible deformity.

Metatarsus adductus is a common condition in newborns and usually resolves spontaneously without treatment during the first year of life. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is reassurance. No intervention is necessary at this time.

Foot abduction brace (option A) is not indicated for metatarsus adductus as it is a flexible deformity that typically resolves without treatment.

Osteotomy of the metatarsals (option B) and arthrodesis of the forefoot (option C) are surgical interventions that are not necessary for metatarsus adductus, especially in a newborn. These options are more appropriate for severe or rigid deformities that do not correct with conservative measures.

Tarsometatarsal capsulotomy (option E) is a surgical procedure used for the correction of rigid metatarsus adductus. It is not indicated in this case as the deformity is flexible and corrects with stimulation.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Reassurance.",
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of right upper abdominal pain and nausea. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 91 kg (200 lb); her BMI is 34 kg/m2. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows a distended abdomen and right upper quadrant tenderness with normal bowel sounds. Laboratory studies show:
Leukocyte count 14,000/mm3
Serum
Total bilirubin 1.1 mg/dL
AST 32 U/L
ALT 40 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase 68 U/L
Abdominal ultrasonography is performed, but the results are inconclusive. Cholescintigraphy shows the intrahepatic bile ducts, hepatic ducts, common bile duct, and proximal small bowel. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Autodigestion of pancreatic parenchyma
(B): Hypomotility of the gallbadder
(C): Fistula between the gallbladder and small intestine
(D): Infection with a hepatotropic virus
(E): Obstruction of the cystic duct
",Obstruction of the cystic duct,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Obstruction of the cystic duct.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including right upper abdominal pain, nausea, and a distended abdomen, are consistent with biliary colic, which is typically caused by obstruction of the cystic duct. This obstruction can lead to distention of the gallbladder and increased pressure, resulting in pain. The patient's laboratory studies are also consistent with biliary colic, as there is no significant elevation in liver enzymes or bilirubin levels. The inconclusive abdominal ultrasonography and the findings on cholescintigraphy further support the diagnosis of cystic duct obstruction.",
"A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the intensive care unit for shortness of breath and palpitations. A cardiac catheterization is performed and measurements of the left ventricular volume and pressure at different points in the cardiac cycle are obtained. The patient's pressure-volume loop (gray) is shown with a normal pressure-volume loop (black) for comparison. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Mitral valve regurgitation
(B): Increased systemic vascular resistance
(C): Increased ventricular wall stiffness
(D): Impaired left ventricular contractility
(E): Aortic stenosis
",Increased ventricular wall stiffness,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Increased ventricular wall stiffness.

Explanation:
The pressure-volume loop is a graphical representation of the changes in left ventricular pressure and volume throughout the cardiac cycle. In a normal pressure-volume loop, the ventricle fills during diastole (lower left portion of the loop) and then contracts during systole (upper right portion of the loop) to eject blood into the systemic circulation.

In this patient's pressure-volume loop, the loop is narrower and more elongated, indicating decreased ventricular compliance and increased ventricular stiffness. This increased stiffness impairs the ventricle's ability to fill adequately during diastole, leading to decreased stroke volume and cardiac output. This can result in symptoms such as shortness of breath and palpitations.

Mitral valve regurgitation (A) would typically result in a wider pressure-volume loop, as blood would flow back into the left atrium during systole. Increased systemic vascular resistance (B) would increase the afterload on the ventricle, resulting in a higher pressure-volume loop. Impaired left ventricular contractility (D) would result in a smaller pressure-volume loop, as the ventricle would have difficulty ejecting blood. Aortic stenosis (E) would result in a narrower pressure-volume loop, but the loop would be more circular in shape rather than elongated.",
"A 22-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, intermittent rigors, and night sweats. She also has a 1-month history of progressive fatigue. Five weeks ago, she was hospitalized and received intravenous antibiotics for treatment of bacterial meningitis while visiting relatives in Guatemala. Her temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 105/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and scattered petechiae and ecchymoses. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.0 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 1,100/mm3 with 30% segmented neutrophils, and a platelet count of 20,000/mm3 . Blood cultures grow coagulase-negative staphylococci. The patient was most likely treated with which of the following antibiotics?
Options:
(A): Doxycycline
(B): Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(C): Vancomycin
(D): Linezolid
(E): Chloramphenicol
",Chloramphenicol,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Chloramphenicol.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and presentation, she most likely developed a condition called aplastic anemia as a complication of her previous bacterial meningitis treatment. Aplastic anemia is a rare but serious side effect of certain medications, including chloramphenicol. The patient's symptoms of fever, fatigue, and night sweats, along with her low blood counts (low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count), are consistent with aplastic anemia. The presence of petechiae and ecchymoses suggests a bleeding tendency, which is also seen in aplastic anemia due to the low platelet count.

Chloramphenicol is known to cause bone marrow suppression, leading to aplastic anemia. It is important to note that chloramphenicol is rarely used in the United States due to its potential for serious side effects, including aplastic anemia. However, it is still used in some parts of the world, including Guatemala, where the patient was visiting.

The other antibiotic options listed (doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, and linezolid) are not associated with the development of aplastic anemia. Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic commonly used for various infections. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is a combination antibiotic used for urinary tract infections and other bacterial infections. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used for serious infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibiotic used for certain resistant infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Therefore, the most likely antibiotic that the patient was treated with is chloramphenicol, which can cause aplastic anemia as a side effect.",
"An otherwise healthy 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss during this time. Physical examination shows bilateral pitting pedal edema. An endoscopy shows prominent rugae in the gastric fundus. Biopsy shows parietal cell atrophy. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause?
Options:
(A): Serotonin-secreting gastric tumor
(B): Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells
(C): Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue
(D): Excessive somatostatin secretion
(E): Ectopic secretion of gastrin
",Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with the weight loss, suggest a gastrointestinal disorder. The physical examination findings of bilateral pitting pedal edema indicate fluid retention, which can be seen in conditions associated with protein loss, such as malabsorption. The endoscopic findings of prominent rugae in the gastric fundus and biopsy showing parietal cell atrophy are consistent with Menetrier disease.

Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by hypertrophy of the gastric mucosa, leading to excessive mucus production. This proliferation of gastric mucus-producing cells results in the formation of large gastric folds (rugae) and parietal cell atrophy. The excessive mucus production can lead to protein loss, causing hypoalbuminemia and subsequent fluid retention, as seen in this patient with bilateral pitting pedal edema.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and findings. Serotonin-secreting gastric tumors (option A) can cause symptoms such as diarrhea and flushing, but they do not typically cause parietal cell atrophy or prominent rugae. Neoplasia of submucosal lymphoid tissue (option C) is not associated with the clinical findings described. Excessive somatostatin secretion (option D) would lead to decreased gastric acid secretion and would not cause the symptoms and findings seen in this patient. Ectopic secretion of gastrin (option E) would lead to increased gastric acid secretion and would not cause the parietal cell atrophy seen in this patient.",
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department. He was brought in by staff from the homeless shelter when they found him unresponsive. The patient is a known IV drug abuser but otherwise has an unknown past medical history. He currently attends a methadone clinic. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 97/48 mmHg, pulse is 140/min, respirations are 29/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Initial laboratory values are shown below.

K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 19 mEq/L
Glucose: 90 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Insulin, IV fluids, and potassium
(B): Insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose
(C): IV fluids only
(D): Oral rehydration
(E): Supportive therapy and close monitoring
","Insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and glucose.

Explanation:
The patient's initial presentation with unresponsiveness, tachycardia, hypotension, and laboratory findings of hyperglycemia (glucose 589 mg/dL) and severe hyperkalemia (K+ 6.3 mEq/L) is consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, characterized by insulin deficiency and an increase in counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol, catecholamines, growth hormone). The lack of insulin leads to increased lipolysis and ketogenesis, resulting in metabolic acidosis. The increased counter-regulatory hormones also lead to increased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, causing hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemia leads to osmotic diuresis and subsequent dehydration. The dehydration, along with the metabolic acidosis, leads to electrolyte abnormalities, including hyperkalemia.

The initial management of DKA involves the administration of IV fluids, insulin, and potassium. IV fluids are given to correct the dehydration and improve tissue perfusion. Insulin is administered to reverse the ketogenesis and promote glucose uptake by cells. Potassium is given to correct the total body potassium deficit and prevent hypokalemia, which can occur as a result of insulin therapy. The administration of glucose is not necessary initially because the patient already has hyperglycemia. Giving glucose without insulin can worsen the hyperglycemia and exacerbate the metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the correct next step in management is to administer insulin, potassium, IV fluids, and withhold glucose.",
"A 67-year-old man who was diagnosed with arthritis 16 years ago presents with right knee swelling and pain. His left knee was swollen a few weeks ago, but now with both joints affected, he has difficulty walking and feels frustrated. He also has back pain which makes it extremely difficult to move around and be active during the day. He says his pain significantly improves with rest. He also suffers from dandruff for which he uses special shampoos. Physical examination is notable for pitting of his nails. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Psoriatic arthritis
(B): Arthritis mutilans
(C): Rheumatoid arthritis
(D): Familial mediterranean fever
(E): Mixed connective tissue disease
",Psoriatic arthritis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Psoriatic arthritis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in individuals with psoriasis. The patient's history of arthritis for 16 years, along with the presence of joint swelling and pain in both knees, is suggestive of a chronic inflammatory arthritis. The improvement of pain with rest is a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis. The patient's back pain is also a common manifestation of psoriatic arthritis, as it can affect the spine and sacroiliac joints. The presence of dandruff and pitting of the nails further supports the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, as these are common dermatologic manifestations of psoriasis. Arthritis mutilans (B) is a severe form of psoriatic arthritis characterized by rapid and destructive joint involvement, which is not described in this patient. Rheumatoid arthritis (C) typically presents with symmetric joint involvement and is less likely in this case. Familial Mediterranean fever (D) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serositis, and is not associated with psoriasis or joint involvement. Mixed connective tissue disease (E) is characterized by features of multiple autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis, and is less likely in this patient.",
"A 65-year-old woman schedules an appointment with her physician for evaluation of weight loss and weakness. The weakness is more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair. The weakness improves after brief exercise. She also has bladder incontinence for the past 4 weeks and was given an anticholinesterase agent with no improvement. What is the most likely cause of the symptoms?
Options:
(A): Botulism
(B): Duchenne muscular dystrophy
(C): Hypothyroidism
(D): Myasthenia gravis
(E): Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung
",Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Paraneoplastic syndrome from small cell carcinoma of the lung.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of weight loss, weakness, and bladder incontinence are concerning for a neurological disorder. The weakness being more noticeable when climbing stairs and combing hair, and improving after brief exercise, suggests a myopathic process. The lack of improvement with an anticholinesterase agent also points away from myasthenia gravis.

Paraneoplastic syndromes are a group of disorders that occur as a result of an immune response to a malignancy. In this case, the small cell carcinoma of the lung is likely causing the paraneoplastic syndrome, which is characterized by muscle weakness and weight loss. Bladder incontinence can also be seen in paraneoplastic syndromes.

Botulism is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum and typically presents with symmetric descending flaccid paralysis, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive disorder that presents in childhood with progressive muscle weakness and wasting. It is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms at her age.

Hypothyroidism can cause muscle weakness, but it is not typically associated with bladder incontinence. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a myopathic process rather than a primary endocrine disorder.",
"A 3-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician with persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms suggestive of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia. His weight is in the 10th percentile. He is being evaluated for an immunodeficiency disease. Laboratory results for the HIV are negative by PCR. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings in this patient?
Options:
(A): Defective T cell function
(B): Grossly reduced levels of B cells
(C): An X-linked inheritance of HLA genes
(D): Defective isotype switching
(E): Selective IgA deficiency
",Defective T cell function,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Defective T cell function.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of persistent diarrhea, oral candidiasis, and signs and symptoms of RSV pneumonia, along with a weight in the 10th percentile, suggests an immunodeficiency. The most likely cause of these findings is a defect in T cell function.

T cells play a crucial role in the immune response, particularly in cell-mediated immunity. Defects in T cell function can lead to recurrent infections, including respiratory infections and opportunistic infections such as oral candidiasis. Additionally, T cells are involved in regulating the immune response and can help control viral infections like RSV.

The other options are less likely causes of the patient's presentation:
(B) Grossly reduced levels of B cells: While B cell deficiencies can also lead to recurrent infections, the presence of oral candidiasis and signs of RSV pneumonia suggest a defect in T cell function rather than a primary B cell deficiency.
(C) An X-linked inheritance of HLA genes: HLA genes are involved in the immune response, but an X-linked inheritance of HLA genes is not a known cause of immunodeficiency.
(D) Defective isotype switching: Isotype switching refers to the process by which B cells change the type of antibody they produce. While defects in isotype switching can lead to antibody deficiencies, the patient's presentation suggests a defect in T cell function rather than a primary antibody deficiency.
(E) Selective IgA deficiency: IgA deficiency is a common primary immunodeficiency, but it typically presents with recurrent respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, rather than the specific findings seen in this patient.",
"A 53-year-old man with recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma is enrolled in a clinical trial for a novel chemotherapeutic agent that his physician believes may be beneficial to his condition. The novel drug was previously tested in a small population and is now undergoing a larger phase 3 trial in preparation for FDA approval. A dose-response trial had the following results:

10 mg dose - 6/59 patients demonstrated improvement
20 mg dose - 19/49 patients demonstrated improvement
30 mg dose - 26/53 patients demonstrated improvement
40 mg dose - 46/51 patients demonstrated improvement

The same trial also had the following safety profile:

20 mg dose - 5/49 patients had a treatment related adverse event
40 mg dose - 11/51 patients had a treatment related adverse event
60 mg dose - 15/42 patients had a treatment related adverse event
80 mg dose - 23/47 patients had a treatment related adverse event
100 mg dose - 47/52 patients had a treatment related adverse event

Based on this study, which of the following represents the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent?
Options:
(A): 0.375
(B): 0.5
(C): 2
(D): 2.5
(E): 2.67
",2.67,Incorrect,"The therapeutic index is a measure of the safety and efficacy of a drug. It is calculated by dividing the number of patients who demonstrated improvement by the number of patients who experienced a treatment-related adverse event. 

Let's calculate the therapeutic index for each dose:

10 mg dose: 6/59 = 0.102
20 mg dose: 19/49 = 0.388
30 mg dose: 26/53 = 0.491
40 mg dose: 46/51 = 0.902

Based on these calculations, the 40 mg dose has the highest therapeutic index of 0.902. 

Therefore, the most likely therapeutic index for this novel chemotherapeutic agent is (D) 2.5.",
"A 67-year-old male is seen by neurology after he was noticed to be speaking strangely by his family. After acute treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), the patient is able to recover most of his speech. Subsequent neurologic exam finds that the patient is fluent while speaking and is able to comprehend both one and two step instructions. Noticeably the patient remains unable to complete tasks involving verbal repetition. Residual damage to which of the following structures is most likely responsible for this patient's syndrome?
Options:
(A): Arcuate fasciculus
(B): Inferior frontal gyrus
(C): Superior temporal gyrus
(D): Inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus
(E): Arcuate fasciculus + inferior frontal gyrus + superior temporal gyrus
",Arcuate fasciculus,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Arcuate fasciculus.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fluent speech, comprehension of one and two-step instructions, and difficulty with verbal repetition are consistent with a condition known as conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is typically caused by damage to the arcuate fasciculus, a white matter tract that connects the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke's area) with the inferior frontal gyrus (Broca's area). 

The arcuate fasciculus is responsible for transmitting information between these two language areas, allowing for the repetition of spoken language. Damage to the arcuate fasciculus disrupts this connection, resulting in the inability to repeat words or phrases accurately. 

In this case, the patient's ability to comprehend and produce fluent speech suggests that the inferior frontal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus are intact. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's syndrome is residual damage to the arcuate fasciculus.",
"A 27-year-old woman presents to the office with concerns about her long struggle with her physical appearance since adolescence. She says she has always been ""large"" and was constantly targeted by her classmates and coworkers for being so. Her main concern at the moment is her acne and unwanted facial hair on her upper lip, for which she often visits a local spa. She has tried numerous diet plans, exercise regimens, and cosmetic products with little to no effect. Recently, she underwent a glucose tolerance test that showed a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours of a 75 g dose of oral glucose. She has a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and a menstrual cycle that occurs every 45 days. Her pulse is 72/min and the blood pressure is 138/80 mm Hg. On physical examination, her height is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) and her weight is 85 kg (187 lb), and she has severe inflammatory acne over the cheeks and forehead and dark coarse hairs on the back. What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
Options:
(A): Hypothyroidism
(B): Idiopathic hirsutism
(C): Cushing's disease
(D): Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
(E): Ovarian hyperthecosis
",Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS),Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. The patient's history of long-standing struggles with her physical appearance, including unwanted facial hair and acne, are classic signs of hyperandrogenism. Additionally, her menstrual cycle occurring every 45 days suggests anovulation. The presence of severe inflammatory acne and dark coarse hairs on the back further support the diagnosis of PCOS.

The patient's glucose tolerance test result of a plasma glucose level of 160 mg/dL (8.9 mmol/L) after 2 hours is consistent with impaired glucose tolerance, which is commonly seen in patients with PCOS. The family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus also increases the likelihood of PCOS as the underlying cause.

Hypothyroidism (option A) can cause weight gain and menstrual irregularities, but it does not typically present with hyperandrogenism or polycystic ovaries.

Idiopathic hirsutism (option B) refers to excessive hair growth in women without any identifiable cause. However, this patient's presentation is more consistent with PCOS, which is a common cause of hirsutism.

Cushing's disease (option C) is characterized by excessive cortisol production, which can lead to weight gain, acne, and hirsutism. However, this patient does not have the typical features of Cushing's disease, such as central obesity, thinning of the skin, or easy bruising.

Ovarian hyperthecosis (option E) is a rare condition characterized by hyperplasia of the ovarian stroma and excessive androgen production. It typically presents with severe hirsutism and virilization, which are not prominent features in this patient's presentation.",

His blood sugar analyses are as follows:
Fasting 141 mg/ dL
2 hours Post-Prandial 235 mg/ dL
HbA1c 8.1%
Which of the following is the best measure to prevent the progression of the symptoms present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Use of atorvastatin
(B): Femoro-Ileal artery bypass
(C): Strict blood glucose control
(D): Strict control of blood pressure
(E): Lower limb amputation
",Strict blood glucose control,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Strict blood glucose control.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is experiencing symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, such as tingling, numbness, and persistent pain in the lower limbs. These symptoms are likely due to uncontrolled diabetes and high blood sugar levels.

Strict blood glucose control is the best measure to prevent the progression of these symptoms. By maintaining tight control of blood sugar levels, the patient can prevent further damage to the nerves and potentially even reverse some of the existing symptoms. This can be achieved through lifestyle modifications, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, as well as medication management, including consistent use of prescribed diabetes medications like metformin and glimepiride.

The other options listed are not appropriate for managing the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy in this patient:

(A) Use of atorvastatin: Atorvastatin is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels and is not indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy.

(B) Femoro-Ileal artery bypass: This surgical procedure is used to bypass blocked or narrowed arteries in the legs, typically in cases of peripheral arterial disease. While peripheral arterial disease can cause similar symptoms to peripheral neuropathy, the patient's ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is normal, indicating that arterial blood flow is not compromised. Therefore, a bypass procedure is not necessary in this case.

(D) Strict control of blood pressure: While it is important to manage blood pressure in patients with diabetes, strict control of blood pressure alone will not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is uncontrolled blood sugar levels.

(E) Lower limb amputation: Amputation is a last resort option for severe cases of peripheral neuropathy that do not respond to other treatments. It is not appropriate or necessary in this patient's case, as his symptoms can be managed and potentially reversed with strict blood glucose control.",
"A one-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for bilious vomiting. The patient has urinated multiple times since birth but has not yet passed meconium. He was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old gravida 3 via vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes. The patient’s mother received routine prenatal care and declined first trimester screening. She subsequently underwent a quadruple screen at 15 weeks gestation that demonstrated decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), increased beta-hCG, decreased unconjugated estriol, and increased inhibin A. Her last ultrasound prior to onset of labor demonstrated an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm. The patient’s two older siblings are both healthy. The patient’s temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 58/37 mmHg, pulse is 166/min, and respirations are 38/min. On physical exam, the patient is in moderate distress. His abdomen is firm and distended with hypoactive bowel sounds.

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this fetus’s presentation?
Options:
(A): Duodenal atresia
(B): Intestinal malrotation
(C): Meconium ileus
(D): Necrotizing enterocolitis
(E): Pyloric stenosis
",Duodenal atresia,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Duodenal atresia.

Explanation:
The presentation of bilious vomiting in a one-day-old male with no passage of meconium is highly suggestive of an obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract. Duodenal atresia is a congenital malformation characterized by the complete or partial obstruction of the duodenum. It is commonly associated with other anomalies, such as Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. The maternal serum screening findings in this case, including decreased AFP and increased beta-hCG, are consistent with an increased risk of chromosomal abnormalities. The presence of polyhydramnios, as indicated by the amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 28 cm, is also commonly seen in cases of duodenal atresia due to impaired swallowing of amniotic fluid. The patient's symptoms of bilious vomiting, abdominal distention, and hypoactive bowel sounds further support the diagnosis of duodenal atresia. Intestinal malrotation, meconium ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis, and pyloric stenosis are less likely to present with bilious vomiting in the neonatal period.",
"A healthy 23-year-old male is undergoing an exercise stress test as part of his physiology class. If blood were to be sampled at different locations before and after the stress test, which area of the body would contain the lowest oxygen content at both time points?
Options:
(A): Superior vena cava
(B): Inferior vena cava
(C): Coronary sinus
(D): Pulmonary artery
(E): Pulmonary vein
",Coronary sinus,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Coronary sinus.

Explanation:
During exercise, the body requires more oxygen to meet the increased metabolic demands. As a result, oxygen is extracted from the blood by the tissues, leading to a decrease in oxygen content. The coronary sinus is a blood vessel that collects deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle (myocardium) and returns it to the right atrium of the heart. Since the coronary sinus collects blood from the heart muscle, which has extracted oxygen for its own metabolic needs, it will have the lowest oxygen content compared to other locations.

The superior vena cava (option A) carries deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the right atrium, but it does not directly collect blood from the heart muscle. Therefore, it will have a higher oxygen content compared to the coronary sinus.

The inferior vena cava (option B) carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body to the right atrium. Similar to the superior vena cava, it does not directly collect blood from the heart muscle, so it will have a higher oxygen content compared to the coronary sinus.

The pulmonary artery (option D) carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle of the heart to the lungs for oxygenation. It does not collect blood from the heart muscle, so it will have a higher oxygen content compared to the coronary sinus.

The pulmonary vein (option E) carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart. It does not collect blood from the heart muscle, so it will have a higher oxygen content compared to the coronary sinus.

Therefore, the coronary sinus will have the lowest oxygen content at both time points before and after the exercise stress test.",
"A 45-year-old G5P4105 presents to her gynecologist’s office with six months of increasingly heavy periods. She now soaks one super absorbent tampon every two hours for five days each cycle. Her cycles have also become irregular, with intermenstrual bleeding for the last two months. She now experiences significant dysmenorrhea, requiring 400 mg ibuprofen every four hours for the majority of each menses. In addition, she reports new onset mild dyspareunia with intercourse and a “heavy feeling” in her pelvis. She has also noticed increased urinary frequency but denies bowel changes. The patient has a past medical history of obesity and type II diabetes on metformin. Her last child was born four years ago, and she has had five spontaneous vaginal deliveries. At this office visit, temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 137/84 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 14/min. Which of the following physical exam findings is most likely to be present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Rectouterine septum nodularity
(B): Globular 10-week sized uterus
(C): Adnexal mass
(D): Irregular 14-week sized uterus
(E): No remarkable physical exam finding
",Globular 10-week sized uterus,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Globular 10-week sized uterus.

Explanation:
The patient's history and symptoms are suggestive of a possible uterine pathology, such as uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are benign smooth muscle tumors that commonly occur in women of reproductive age. They can cause heavy menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia), irregular periods, and pelvic pain. The patient's symptoms of heavy periods, intermenstrual bleeding, dysmenorrhea, and a ""heavy feeling"" in the pelvis are consistent with uterine fibroids.

On physical examination, a globular 10-week sized uterus is most likely to be present in this patient. Uterine fibroids can cause the uterus to enlarge, resulting in a palpable mass on abdominal examination. The size of the uterus is often described in terms of gestational weeks, with a 10-week sized uterus indicating that the uterus is approximately the size it would be at 10 weeks of pregnancy.

Rectouterine septum nodularity (option A) is not a typical finding in uterine fibroids. It is more commonly associated with adenomyosis, which is a condition where the endometrial tissue grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.

An adnexal mass (option C) is not likely to be present in this patient based on the given history and symptoms. Adnexal masses are usually associated with ovarian pathology, such as ovarian cysts or tumors. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with uterine fibroids rather than ovarian pathology.

An irregular 14-week sized uterus (option D) is less likely in this patient. Uterine fibroids typically cause the uterus to enlarge symmetrically, resulting in a globular shape rather than an irregular shape.

No remarkable physical exam finding (option E) is not the most likely finding in this patient. Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is expected that there would be a physical exam finding related to the uterine pathology, such as an enlarged uterus.",
"A man is brought into the emergency department by the police department. The officer state that the man has been arrested multiple times for public alcohol intoxication, but recently became homeless. On exam, the man is behaving erratically. His vitals are all within normal limits. He appears confused and has a slurred speech. On gait exam, the patient is ataxic and cannot stand without support for more than a few seconds. Labs return with the following values: Na 140, K 4, Cl 106, BUN 8, Cr 2. His ABG has pH 7.3, PaCO2 13mm, PaO2 130mm, HCO3 7. His urinalysis is shown in Figure 1. Blood salicylate levels return as normal. While you await other diagnostic tests, which of the following should be administered next to treat this patient?
Options:
(A): Ethanol
(B): Naltrexone
(C): Naloxone
(D): Flumazenil
(E): Fomepizole
",Fomepizole,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Fomepizole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of alcohol intoxication and the presence of ataxia, confusion, slurred speech, and abnormal labs (low HCO3 and elevated anion gap), the patient is likely experiencing alcohol withdrawal. The most appropriate treatment for alcohol withdrawal is benzodiazepines, such as diazepam or lorazepam, to control symptoms and prevent progression to severe withdrawal, which can include seizures and delirium tremens. However, none of the options provided include benzodiazepines.

Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and is used in the treatment of methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning. While it is not the first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal, it can be used in severe cases where benzodiazepines are not effective or contraindicated. Fomepizole inhibits the metabolism of alcohol to acetaldehyde, which can help reduce the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.

Ethanol (option A) is another treatment option for alcohol withdrawal, as it can be used to prevent withdrawal symptoms by providing a controlled amount of alcohol to the patient. However, it is not the next best step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant immediate treatment with ethanol.

Naltrexone (option B) is an opioid receptor antagonist and is used in the treatment of alcohol dependence. It is not indicated for the acute management of alcohol withdrawal.

Naloxone (option C) is an opioid receptor antagonist and is used in the treatment of opioid overdose. It is not indicated for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Flumazenil (option D) is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and is used in the reversal of benzodiazepine overdose or sedation. It is not indicated for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in treating this patient is to administer fomepizole (option E) to help alleviate the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.",

Primary: death from cardiac causes 134 210 0.03
Secondary: hyperkalemia 57 70 0.4
What is the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes? (Round to the nearest whole number.)
Options:
(A): 5
(B): 16
(C): 20
(D): 30
(E): 50
",20,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) 20.

The number needed to treat (NNT) is a measure of the effectiveness of a treatment. It represents the number of patients that need to be treated with a specific intervention in order to prevent one additional outcome event compared to a control group.

In this case, the primary endpoint is death from cardiac causes. The study results show that 134 patients in the medication 1 group died from cardiac causes, while 210 patients in the medication 2 group died from cardiac causes. 

To calculate the NNT, we need to calculate the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference in event rates between the two groups. 

The event rate in the medication 1 group is 134/1500 = 0.0893 (rounded to 4 decimal places).
The event rate in the medication 2 group is 210/1500 = 0.14 (rounded to 2 decimal places).

The ARR is calculated by subtracting the event rate in the medication 1 group from the event rate in the medication 2 group: 0.14 - 0.0893 = 0.0507 (rounded to 4 decimal places).

The NNT is then calculated by taking the reciprocal of the ARR: 1/0.0507 = 19.7 (rounded to the nearest whole number), which is approximately 20.

Therefore, the number needed to treat (NNT) for the primary endpoint of death from cardiac causes is 20. This means that for every 20 patients treated with medication 1 instead of medication 2, one additional death from cardiac causes would be prevented.",
"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of tingling pain in the sole of his right foot when he raises it above chest level during exercises. He reports that he started exercising regularly 2 months ago and that his right calf cramps when he uses the incline feature on the treadmill, forcing him to take frequent breaks. The pain completely disappears after resting for a few minutes. He has an 8-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked two packs of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His only medication is metformin. His pulse is 82/min, and blood pressure is 170/92 mm Hg. Straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot. There is no pain in the back. His muscle strength is normal. Femoral pulses are palpable; right pedal pulses are absent. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Femoropopliteal artery stenosis
(B): Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery
(C): Acute thrombosis of right popliteal vein
(D): Lumbar spinal stenosis
(E): Aortoiliac artery stenosis
""
",Femoropopliteal artery stenosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Femoropopliteal artery stenosis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including tingling pain in the sole of the right foot during exercise and calf cramps with incline treadmill use, are consistent with exercise-induced ischemia. The absence of right pedal pulses suggests arterial insufficiency. The most likely cause of these findings in this patient is atherosclerotic occlusive disease of the femoropopliteal artery. Risk factors for atherosclerosis, such as smoking and diabetes mellitus, are present. The straight leg raise test elicits pallor and tingling pain in the right foot, further supporting the diagnosis of arterial insufficiency. The absence of back pain and normal muscle strength make lumbar spinal stenosis an unlikely cause. Vasculitis of the right popliteal artery and acute thrombosis of the right popliteal vein would not explain the absence of right pedal pulses. Aortoiliac artery stenosis would not explain the absence of right pedal pulses.",
"A 29-year-old primigravid woman at 35 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in labor. She has no history of serious medical illness. She has had an uncomplicated pregnancy. Her last ultrasound at 22 weeks' gestation was normal. On admission, fetal heartbeats cannot be detected by fetal doppler monitor. Ultrasound shows decreased amniotic fluid levels and no evidence of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity. The patient gives birth to a 2296 g (5 lb 1 oz) male infant. Physical examination shows no signs of life. There are no visible malformations. The placenta is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Perform karyotyping of amniotic fluid
(B): Recommend autopsy of the infant
(C): Obtain photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI
(D): Perform maternal antibody and thrombophilia testing
(E): Obtain consent for parental genetic testing
",Recommend autopsy of the infant,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Recommend autopsy of the infant.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with a stillbirth at 35 weeks' gestation. The absence of fetal heartbeats, decreased amniotic fluid levels, and lack of fetal movement, respiration, or heart activity indicate fetal demise. The physical examination shows no signs of visible malformations, and the placenta is unremarkable. 

In cases of stillbirth, it is important to determine the cause of fetal demise to provide appropriate counseling and management for the parents and to potentially prevent future stillbirths. Autopsy of the infant is the most appropriate next step in management. Autopsy can provide valuable information about the cause of stillbirth, such as genetic abnormalities, placental abnormalities, or other factors that may have contributed to fetal demise. It can also help identify any potential risks for future pregnancies.

Performing karyotyping of amniotic fluid (option A) may be considered in cases of stillbirth, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Karyotyping is typically performed on fetal tissue, such as skin or bone, rather than amniotic fluid.

Obtaining photographs, x-ray imaging, and MRI (option C) may be useful in some cases of stillbirth, but they are not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Autopsy provides more comprehensive information about the cause of stillbirth.

Performing maternal antibody and thrombophilia testing (option D) may be considered in cases of stillbirth, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. These tests are typically performed to evaluate for potential maternal factors that may have contributed to fetal demise.

Obtaining consent for parental genetic testing (option E) may be considered in cases of stillbirth, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Autopsy provides more comprehensive information about the cause of stillbirth.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to recommend autopsy of the infant (option B).",
"A 67-year-old man is hospitalized after several days of fever and increasing shortness of breath. Respiratory viral panel returns positive for influenza A and the patient is started on a standard five day course of oseltamivir. Despite therapy, his shortness of breath continues to worsen and his oxygen saturation decreases to the point where ICU transfer and intubation are required. Chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates. Clinical criteria are consistent with development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). After several weeks of supportive therapy, the patient improves with lung function returning to near normal. Which of the following processes is involved in the regeneration of alveolar lining after damage to alveoli occurs?
Options:
(A): Squamous cell proliferation
(B): Sweeping of debris out of the alveoli by ciliated cells
(C): Excess mucus production by goblet cells
(D): Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells
(E): Proliferation of club cells
",Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells.

Explanation:
After damage to the alveoli occurs, the regeneration of the alveolar lining involves the proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells. Surfactant is a substance that helps reduce surface tension in the alveoli, preventing their collapse. Type II pneumocytes, which are specialized epithelial cells, synthesize and secrete surfactant. During the reparative process, these type II pneumocytes proliferate along the alveolar basement membranes, replacing damaged type I pneumocytes and reconstituting the alveolar lining. This proliferation of surfactant-secreting cells is an important step in the recovery of lung function after acute lung injury, such as in the case of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS).",
"A 65-year-old male is treated for anal carcinoma with therapy including external beam radiation. How does radiation affect cancer cells?
Options:
(A): Induces the formation of thymidine dimers
(B): Induces the formation of disulfide bonds
(C): Induces G/T and A/C pair formation
(D): Induces deamination of cytosine
(E): Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA
",Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Induces breaks in double-stranded DNA.

Explanation:
Radiation therapy works by causing damage to the DNA of cancer cells. The key initial damage site is a DNA double-strand break. This double-strand break is repaired by various mechanisms, but it is repaired more slowly in tumor cells compared to normal tissues. Inducing breaks in double-stranded DNA can lead to cell death or mutations in the cancer cells, which can ultimately lead to their destruction. Therefore, option (E) is the correct choice.",
"A 56-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents to his physician with progressive fatigue and new onset muscle cramps. He has had no recent changes to his medication regimen, which includes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and amlodipine. His temperature is 98.0°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 174/111 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 138 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 33 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL

What is the most likely underlying etiology of this patient's hypertension?
Options:
(A): Aldosterone excess
(B): Catecholamine-secreting mass
(C): Cortisol excess
(D): Impaired kidney perfusion
(E): Increased peripheral vascular resistance
",Aldosterone excess,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Aldosterone excess.

Explanation:
The patient's hypertension, along with the laboratory values, suggests an underlying aldosterone excess. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that regulates sodium and potassium balance in the body. Excess aldosterone can lead to sodium retention and potassium loss, resulting in hypertension. In this case, the patient's low potassium level (K+: 3.3 mEq/L) is consistent with aldosterone excess. Additionally, the patient's fatigue and muscle cramps can be attributed to hypokalemia, which is commonly seen in aldosterone excess. The other options, such as catecholamine-secreting mass, cortisol excess, impaired kidney perfusion, and increased peripheral vascular resistance, are less likely based on the given information.",
"A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his skin and generalized pruritus. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and scleral icterus. Urinalysis shows an elevated concentration of bilirubin and a low concentration of urobilinogen. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?
Options:
(A): Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity
(B): Increased hemoglobin breakdown
(C): Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption
(D): Defective hepatic bile excretion
(E): Presence of stones within the gallbladder
",Defective hepatic bile excretion,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Defective hepatic bile excretion.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of yellowish discoloration of the skin and scleral icterus, along with elevated bilirubin levels in the urine, suggests a problem with bilirubin metabolism and excretion. Bilirubin is a breakdown product of hemoglobin and is normally conjugated in the liver with glucuronic acid by the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. This conjugated bilirubin is then excreted into the bile and eventually eliminated in the feces as urobilinogen.

In this case, the low concentration of urobilinogen in the urine suggests that there is a defect in the excretion of bilirubin into the bile. This is most likely due to a problem with hepatic bile excretion, as seen in conditions such as cholestasis or obstructive jaundice. These conditions can be caused by various factors, including liver disease, gallstones, or tumors obstructing the bile ducts.

The other options are less likely to be the underlying cause in this case. Absent UDP-glucuronosyltransferase activity (option A) would result in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, not the conjugated hyperbilirubinemia seen in this patient. Increased hemoglobin breakdown (option B) would lead to increased unconjugated bilirubin levels, not conjugated bilirubin levels. Increased intestinal bilirubin reabsorption (option C) would result in increased urobilinogen levels in the urine, not low levels. The presence of stones within the gallbladder (option E) would not directly affect hepatic bile excretion.",
"A 72-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter because of a 6-month history of worsening short-term memory deficits and social withdrawal. Treatment with galantamine is initiated. Two weeks later, the patient develops vomiting, mild crampy abdominal pain, and watery, nonbloody diarrhea. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Bethanechol
(B): Metoclopramide
(C): Loperamide
(D): Atropine
(E): Oxybutynin
",Atropine,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Atropine.

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which are common side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors like galantamine. These symptoms are due to increased cholinergic activity in the gastrointestinal tract. Atropine, an anticholinergic medication, can be used to counteract the cholinergic effects and relieve the gastrointestinal symptoms. Atropine blocks the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors, reducing the excessive cholinergic stimulation in the gut. This helps to alleviate the symptoms of vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Therefore, atropine is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case.",
"A 61-year-old man with schizophrenia in a locked inpatient psychiatry unit was observed making an unusual smacking motion with his lips, pursing his mouth, and blinking excessively. These symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, but they do not seem to bother the patient. He resides in an inpatient psychiatric facility where he has been successfully treated with haloperidol for the past several months. His physical exam and vitals are within normal limits. Which of the following accurately describes his symptoms?
Options:
(A): Akathisia
(B): Tardive dyskinesia
(C): Acute dystonia
(D): Pseudoparkinsonism
(E): Palsy
",Tardive dyskinesia,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Tardive dyskinesia.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of making smacking motions with his lips, pursing his mouth, and excessive blinking are consistent with the characteristic symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary movement disorder that can occur as a side effect of long-term treatment with antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. It is characterized by abnormal, repetitive movements of the face, tongue, and extremities, including lip smacking, tongue thrusting, facial grimacing, and writhing movements of the arms or legs. These symptoms typically develop after prolonged exposure to antipsychotic medications and can persist even after the medication is discontinued. In this case, the patient's symptoms started slowly about 2 weeks ago and have become more pronounced, which is consistent with the development of tardive dyskinesia. It is important to monitor and manage tardive dyskinesia in patients receiving long-term antipsychotic treatment.",
"A 17-year-old football player with no significant past medical history, social history, or family history presents to his pediatrician with itching in his groin. He says this started during summer workouts leading up to this season. He denies having any rash anywhere else on his body. The blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg, pulse is 67/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and temperature is 38.1°C (98.7°F). Physical examination reveals an erythematous, well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale on the left thigh, pubic region, and perineum. There is no apparent scrotal involvement with the rash. How can you confirm the suspected diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Localized ultrasound
(B): KOH examination of lesion scrapings
(C): Nikolsky's sign on physical exam
(D): Gram stain of skin scrapings
(E): AFB stain of skin scrapings
",KOH examination of lesion scrapings,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) KOH examination of lesion scrapings.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with itching in the groin, erythematous well-demarcated patch with peripheral scale, and absence of scrotal involvement is consistent with tinea cruris, also known as jock itch. Tinea cruris is a fungal infection caused by dermatophytes, commonly Trichophyton rubrum or Epidermophyton floccosum. 

To confirm the suspected diagnosis of tinea cruris, a KOH (potassium hydroxide) examination of lesion scrapings is the most appropriate test. This test involves obtaining a skin scraping from the affected area and mixing it with KOH solution. The KOH dissolves the keratin in the skin cells, allowing for visualization of fungal elements such as hyphae or spores under a microscope. The presence of these fungal elements confirms the diagnosis of tinea cruris.

Localized ultrasound (A) is not necessary for the diagnosis of tinea cruris and would not provide any additional information.

Nikolsky's sign (C) is a clinical sign seen in certain blistering skin conditions, such as pemphigus vulgaris, where slight rubbing of the skin causes separation of the epidermis. It is not relevant to the diagnosis of tinea cruris.

Gram stain of skin scrapings (D) is used to identify bacteria, not fungi. Tinea cruris is caused by a fungal infection, so a Gram stain would not be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

AFB (acid-fast bacilli) stain of skin scrapings (E) is used to identify mycobacteria, specifically Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is not relevant to the diagnosis of tinea cruris, which is caused by dermatophytes.",
"An otherwise healthy 26-year-old man comes to the physician for medication counseling after recently being diagnosed with schizophrenia. Risperidone therapy is initiated. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following adverse effects?
Options:
(A): Agranulocytosis
(B): Shortened QT interval
(C): Gynecomastia
(D): Hypothyroidism
(E): Weight loss
",Gynecomastia,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Gynecomastia.

Explanation:
Risperidone therapy is associated with an increased risk of gynecomastia, which is the development of breast tissue in males. This is due to the medication's ability to increase prolactin levels, a hormone that stimulates breast development and milk production. Gynecomastia can cause breast tenderness and enlargement in males. It is important for healthcare providers to monitor for this adverse effect and address any concerns or discomfort that the patient may have.",
"A 15-year-old woman presents with fever, altered mental status and a petechial rash on her lower extremities and back since yesterday evening. She also says she has been nauseous for the past 3 hours and has vomited twice. The patient mentions she has had heavy menstrual bleeding for the past few days. Her blood pressure is 95/80 mm Hg and her temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F). On physical examination, the patient appears diaphoretic. A pelvic examination reveals a tampon in her vagina. Binding and activation of which of the following T cell receptors is responsible for this patient’s most likely condition?
Options:
(A): B7 receptor
(B): Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor
(C): CD40
(D): CD3
(E): IgCAM
",Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. TSS is characterized by fever, altered mental status, rash, hypotension, and multiorgan dysfunction. In this case, the patient's heavy menstrual bleeding and the presence of a tampon in her vagina provide a likely source of infection. 

T cells play a crucial role in the immune response against bacterial infections. The T cell receptor (TCR) is responsible for recognizing and binding to antigens presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The TCR is composed of two chains, the α-chain and the β-chain, which are responsible for antigen recognition. The β-chain has a variable region that is responsible for binding to specific antigens.

In this patient's case, the binding and activation of the variable β-sequence of the TCR would be responsible for the immune response against the Staphylococcus aureus infection causing toxic shock syndrome. The TCR would recognize and bind to antigens presented by APCs, leading to the activation of T cells and the subsequent immune response against the infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Variable β-sequence of the T cell receptor.",
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of pallor and increasing lethargy for 2 days. One week ago, he experienced abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea that have since subsided. The patient's father states that they returned early from a 6-week roadtrip in Mexico because of these symptoms. His parents have been giving him oral rehydration solution. His immunizations are up-to-date. He appears pale. His temperature is 38.4°C (101.1°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 35/min, and blood pressure is 95/50 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus. The abdomen is soft and nontender; there is no rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8.5 g/dL

A blood smear shows schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): Henoch-Schönlein Purpura
(B): Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(C): Hemolytic uremic syndrome
(D): Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
(E): Disseminated intravascular coagulation
""
",Hemolytic uremic syndrome,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a condition characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. It is most commonly caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), particularly serotype O157:H7. In this case, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea one week prior are consistent with a gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by STEC.

The laboratory findings in this patient are also consistent with HUS. The presence of schistocytes on the blood smear indicates the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. The low platelet count and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) further support the diagnosis of HUS. Additionally, the patient's renal dysfunction, as evidenced by the elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, is a common feature of HUS.

The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Henoch-Schönlein Purpura typically presents with palpable purpura, arthritis or arthralgia, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic abnormalities, fever, and renal dysfunction. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia without evidence of hemolysis or renal dysfunction. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to both bleeding and thrombosis. None of these conditions fully explain the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings.",
"A 17-year-old girl is referred by her dentist for a suspected eating disorder. She has been visiting the same dentist since childhood and for the past 2 years has had at least 2 visits for dental caries. She eventually admitted to him that she regularly induces vomiting by putting her fingers down her throat. She says she has been doing this for the last few years and purging at least once a week. More recently, she has been inducing emesis more often and even looked into diuretics as she feels that she is gaining more and more weight compared to her ‘skinny friends’. Her BMI is at the 50th percentile for her age and sex. Which of the following features is most consistent with this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed
(B): Patients do not usually initiate treatment
(C): Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia
(D): Patients will typically have a BMI between 17–18.5 kg/m2
(E): Patients usually have significant medical complications
",Patients with this disorder are not further sub-typed,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Patients can have a history of both anorexia and bulimia.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient regularly induces vomiting and purges at least once a week, which are characteristic behaviors of bulimia nervosa. However, she also expresses concerns about gaining weight and compares herself to her ""skinny friends,"" which suggests body image distortion and fear of weight gain, characteristic of anorexia nervosa. This indicates that the patient may have a history of both anorexia and bulimia, making choice (C) the most consistent feature of her condition.

Patients with eating disorders can present with a range of symptoms and behaviors, and it is not uncommon for individuals to have a history of multiple eating disorders. It is important to consider the possibility of co-occurring or transitioning eating disorders when evaluating patients with symptoms suggestive of an eating disorder.",
"A 14-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of fever, chills, abdominal pain, and profuse non-bloody diarrhea. Her symptoms began one week ago, when she had several days of low-grade fever and constipation. She returned from Indonesia 2 weeks ago, where she spent the summer with her grandparents. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°F). Examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness and mild hepatosplenomegaly. There is a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash on her trunk and abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?
Options:
(A): Giardia lamblia
(B): Schistosoma mansoni
(C): Campylobacter jejuni
(D): Salmonella typhi
(E): Clostridium perfringens
",Salmonella typhi,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Salmonella typhi.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, abdominal pain, and profuse non-bloody diarrhea, along with the history of travel to Indonesia, are suggestive of enteric fever, also known as typhoid fever. The most likely causal organism in this case is Salmonella typhi.

Salmonella typhi is a gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever. It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Symptoms typically include fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Hepatosplenomegaly and a faint salmon-colored maculopapular rash, known as rose spots, are characteristic findings in typhoid fever.

Giardia lamblia (A) is a protozoan parasite that causes giardiasis, which is characterized by diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating. However, the symptoms and presentation described in the case are not consistent with giardiasis.

Schistosoma mansoni (B) is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a disease characterized by chronic infection of the liver, intestines, and urinary tract. The symptoms and presentation described in the case are not consistent with schistosomiasis.

Campylobacter jejuni (C) is a bacterial pathogen that commonly causes gastroenteritis. While it can cause fever and diarrhea, the hepatosplenomegaly and rash described in the case are not typical of Campylobacter jejuni infection.

Clostridium perfringens (E) is a bacterium that can cause food poisoning, but it typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea. The symptoms and presentation described in the case are not consistent with Clostridium perfringens infection.",
"A 22-year-old female college student is treated with metronidazole after presenting to student health services with itching, discharge, and pain in her vagina. At a party shortly afterward she experiences facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps after consuming alcohol. Serum levels of which of the following are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption:
Options:
(A): Acetaldehyde
(B): Uric acid
(C): Cytochrome P-450 enzymes
(D): Triglycerides
(E): Amylase
",Acetaldehyde,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Acetaldehyde.

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing a disulfiram-like reaction after consuming alcohol following treatment with metronidazole. Metronidazole can interfere with alcohol metabolism and cause a buildup of acetaldehyde, leading to symptoms such as facial flushing, nausea, tachycardia, dyspnea, headache, and abdominal cramps. Acetaldehyde is the toxic metabolite of alcohol that is normally metabolized by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. Inhibition of this enzyme by metronidazole leads to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, resulting in the disulfiram-like reaction. Therefore, serum levels of acetaldehyde are likely elevated in this patient following alcohol consumption.",
"A 23-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal care visit at 16 weeks gestation. She complains of increased fatigability, but is otherwise well. She takes folic acid, iron, and vitamin D supplementation. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mm Hg; heart rate, 86/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The physical examination is unremarkable. The complete blood count results are as below:
Erythrocyte count 3.9 million/mm3
Hb 11.1 g/dL
HCT 32%
Reticulocyte count 0.2%
MCV 90 fL
Platelet count 210,000/mm3
Leukocyte count 8,100/mm3
Which of the following tests is required to investigate the cause of the patient’s laboratory findings?
Options:
(A): Serum iron level
(B): Serum B12 level
(C): Transferrin
(D): No tests required
(E): Total bilirubin
",No tests required,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) No tests required.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with mild iron deficiency anemia. The hemoglobin (Hb) level is slightly below the normal range (12-16 g/dL for women), and the hematocrit (HCT) is also slightly decreased. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is within the normal range (80-100 fL), indicating that the red blood cells are not abnormally small or large. The reticulocyte count is low, suggesting decreased production of red blood cells. The platelet count and leukocyte count are within the normal range.

Given the patient's history of taking iron supplementation and the absence of any other abnormal findings on physical examination, it is likely that the mild iron deficiency anemia is due to inadequate iron intake or absorption rather than a more serious underlying cause. Therefore, no further tests are required at this time. The patient should be advised to continue taking her iron supplementation and to consume iron-rich foods to improve her iron levels. Regular follow-up and monitoring of her hemoglobin levels should be done to ensure improvement.",
"An 80-year-old man is transferred from a step-down unit to a med-surg floor in the hospital. He had undergone a successful hernia surgery 14 hours ago. Before the surgery, he was pre-treated with atropine, scopolamine, and morphine and recovered well in the PACU after the surgery. There were no complications in the step-down unit and the patient continued to recover. On the med-surg floor, his temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), the heart rate is 98/min, the respiratory rate is 15/min, the blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg, the oxygen saturation is 90%. On physical exam, he is a well-developed, obese man. His heart has a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. His incision site is clean, dry, and intact with an appropriate level of swelling and erythema. During the physical, the patient mentions some discomfort in his abdomen and pelvis and during a records review it is noted that he has not passed urine in the PACU, step-down unit, or since arriving on the med-surg floor. A bladder scan is inconclusive due to body habitus. What is the next best step in the treatment of this patient?
Options:
(A): Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder
(B): Ultrasound the surgical site
(C): Aggressive IV fluids
(D): Digital rectal exam
(E): Renal ultrasound
",Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Insert a ‘straight cath’ into the patient’s bladder.

Explanation:
The patient's inability to pass urine since the surgery, along with the discomfort in the abdomen and pelvis, suggests urinary retention. This can be a common complication after surgery, especially in elderly patients. The patient's inability to pass urine can be due to the effects of anesthesia, medications such as opioids, or postoperative pain. 

In this case, a bladder scan was inconclusive due to the patient's body habitus, so the next best step would be to insert a 'straight catheter' into the patient's bladder. This will help relieve the urinary retention and allow for the measurement of urine output. It will also help assess for any potential complications such as bladder distention or urinary tract infection.

Ultrasound of the surgical site (option B) may be indicated if there are concerns about wound healing or infection, but it does not address the patient's urinary retention.

Aggressive IV fluids (option C) may be indicated in certain situations, such as hypovolemia or dehydration, but it does not address the patient's urinary retention.

A digital rectal exam (option D) may be useful in assessing for any rectal or pelvic abnormalities, but it does not address the patient's urinary retention.

A renal ultrasound (option E) may be indicated if there are concerns about renal function or urinary tract obstruction, but it does not address the immediate issue of urinary retention.",
"A healthy 19-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of painless “blisters” in his mouth. He reports that he noticed a white film on his tongue and the sides of his mouth 2 days ago while brushing his teeth. The film was easily brushed off. He also complains of a bitter metallic taste in his mouth but otherwise denies pain, burning, dysphagia, or hoarseness. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. He is a competitive swimmer and has had 8 sexual partners in the past year. He intermittently uses barrier protection. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. His oral examination demonstrates patches of white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa. A medication with which of the following mechanisms of action is most appropriate in this patient?
Options:
(A): Disruption of cell membrane permeability
(B): Disruption of microtubule formation
(C): Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase
(D): Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase
(E): Inhibition of squalene epoxidase
",Disruption of cell membrane permeability,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Disruption of cell membrane permeability.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with oral candidiasis, which is caused by an overgrowth of Candida species in the mouth. The white pseudomembranes that can be wiped away to reveal erythematous mucosa are characteristic of this condition. Candida species have a cell wall composed of a phospholipid bilayer, and disruption of the cell membrane permeability is the most appropriate mechanism of action for treating this infection.

Option (B): Disruption of microtubule formation is not the correct answer because this mechanism of action is associated with drugs used to treat fungal infections caused by dermatophytes, such as griseofulvin.

Option (C): Inhibition of 14-alpha-demethylase is not the correct answer because this mechanism of action is associated with azole antifungal drugs, which are used to treat systemic fungal infections, such as candidemia or invasive aspergillosis.

Option (D): Inhibition of beta-glucan synthase is not the correct answer because this mechanism of action is associated with echinocandin antifungal drugs, which are used to treat invasive fungal infections, such as candidemia or invasive aspergillosis.

Option (E): Inhibition of squalene epoxidase is not the correct answer because this mechanism of action is associated with allylamine antifungal drugs, which are used to treat dermatophyte infections, such as tinea corporis or tinea pedis.",
"A 56-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of subacute back pain for the past month. The pain is described as a dull, constant ache that is worse at night. He could not recall any precipitating event except for an amateur weight-lifting competition that he participated in 2 months ago. Past medical history is significant for non-small cell lung cancer that was diagnosed and successfully treated. A PET scan 1 year ago demonstrated no recurrence. Physical exam was unremarkable except for some point tenderness along the lumbosacral area. What is the most likely imaging finding in this patient?
Options:
(A): Blastic lesions of the lumbar spine
(B): Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve
(C): Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine
(D): Narrowing of the lumbar disc space
(E): Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine
",Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Lytic lesions of the lumbar spine.

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and the presence of persistent, severe back pain, the most likely imaging finding in this patient would be lytic lesions of the lumbar spine. Lytic lesions refer to areas of bone destruction, which can be caused by metastatic cancer. In patients with a history of cancer, back pain that worsens at night and is not relieved by rest should raise suspicion for metastatic disease. The point tenderness along the lumbosacral area further supports the possibility of lytic lesions in the lumbar spine. 

Blastic lesions (option A) refer to areas of increased bone density and are less likely in this patient with a history of lung cancer. Bulging disc impinging on lumbar spinal nerve (option B) and narrowing of the lumbar disc space (option D) are more commonly associated with degenerative disc disease and would not explain the patient's symptoms and history. Sacroilitis and fusion of the lumbar spine (option E) are less likely given the absence of specific findings on physical examination and the patient's history of lung cancer.",
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and bilious vomiting for 6 hours. He has not had bowel movements in the past 24 hours. He appears ill. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F) and pulse is 122/min. Examination shows a distended abdomen. There is tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen; guarding and rebound tenderness are present. Bowel sounds are decreased. An x-ray of the abdomen shows dilated loops of bowel. He has been accompanied by his 14-year-old brother. The surgeon recommends an emergency laparotomy. The parents are away visiting friends and cannot be reached. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Get consent from the patient's brother
(B): Get consent from the patient
(C): Obtain a court order for surgery
(D): Perform emergency laparotomy
(E): Delay surgery until parental consent
",Perform emergency laparotomy,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Perform emergency laparotomy.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the 4-year-old boy presents with severe abdominal pain, bilious vomiting, distended abdomen, tenderness to palpation, guarding, rebound tenderness, and decreased bowel sounds. These findings, along with the x-ray showing dilated loops of bowel, are consistent with a surgical emergency, such as intestinal obstruction or volvulus. Delaying surgery could lead to further complications and potentially life-threatening consequences for the patient.

In emergency situations where the parents or legal guardians cannot be reached, the principle of ""implied consent"" can be applied. Implied consent means that in life-threatening situations where immediate intervention is necessary, healthcare providers can proceed with treatment without explicit consent from the patient or their legal guardians. The surgeon's recommendation for an emergency laparotomy indicates the urgency of the situation, and waiting for parental consent or obtaining a court order would cause unnecessary delays in providing the necessary medical care.

While it is important to involve the patient's family and obtain consent as soon as possible, the priority in this case is to address the immediate medical needs of the patient. Therefore, the most appropriate next best step in management is to perform the emergency laparotomy.",
"A 3-week-old male newborn is brought to the hospital because of poor weight gain since birth. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via normal vaginal delivery. He weighed 3005 g (6 lb, 10 oz) at birth and currently weighs 2835 g (6 lb, 4 oz). He has been latching on and breastfeeding well since birth. His mother has a history of Graves' disease and underwent near-total thyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy after her symptoms could not be controlled with antithyroid drugs. She is currently receiving L-thyroxine therapy. The patient's temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 176/min, and respirations are 42/min. He appears irritable. Examination shows a diaphoretic infant with a paucity of subcutaneous fat. There is swelling of the neck at the midline. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
Options:
(A): Transplacental passage of thyroglobulin antibodies
(B): Transplacental passage of thyroid peroxidase antibodies
(C): Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies
(D): Transplacental viral infection
(E): Opiate use in the mother
",Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Transplacental passage of TSH receptor antibodies.

Explanation:
In this case, the newborn's mother has a history of Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of antibodies against the thyroid gland. These antibodies can cross the placenta and stimulate the baby's thyroid gland, leading to neonatal hyperthyroidism. The symptoms of poor weight gain, irritability, and swelling of the neck are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH receptor antibodies in both the mother and the baby confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is necessary to manage the severe metabolic stress the infant is experiencing.",
"A 57-year-old female with a past medical history of alcoholism presents to the emergency room vomiting bright red blood. She is accompanied by her partner, who reports that she had been complaining of black and tarry stools for the past several days. Vital signs are temperature 37 degrees celsius, heart rate 141 beats per minute, blood pressure 90/60, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. On physical examination, she has splenomegaly and a positive fluid wave. The remainder of her examination is within normal limits. The patient is stabilized with intravenous fluids, and her blood pressure improves. Subsequent emergent upper endoscopy reveals bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, but no gastric bleed. In the endoscopy suite she also receives IV octreotide. After intervention and resolution of her acute bleed, which of the following pharmacologic agents is indicated?
Options:
(A): Phentolamine
(B): Prazosin
(C): Nifedipine
(D): Nadalol
(E): Doxazosin
",Nadalol,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Nadalol.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with bleeding from the submucosal veins in the lower 1/3 of the esophagus, which is suggestive of esophageal varices. Esophageal varices are dilated submucosal veins that occur as a result of portal hypertension, often seen in patients with chronic liver disease, such as alcoholism. The initial management of acute variceal bleeding includes volume resuscitation with intravenous fluids to stabilize the patient's hemodynamic status. In addition to volume resuscitation, pharmacologic therapy is indicated to reduce portal pressure and prevent rebleeding.

The medication of choice for acute variceal bleeding is a nonselective beta-blocker, such as nadolol or propranolol. These medications reduce portal pressure by decreasing splanchnic blood flow and cardiac output. They have been shown to decrease the risk of rebleeding and improve survival in patients with acute variceal bleeding. Octreotide, which the patient received during the endoscopy, is also used in the treatment of variceal bleeding, but it is not recommended for routine use in patients with acute nonvariceal upper GI bleeding.

Phentolamine (A), prazosin (B), nifedipine (C), and doxazosin (E) are not indicated in the management of acute variceal bleeding. Phentolamine is an alpha-blocker used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies. Prazosin, nifedipine, and doxazosin are not recommended for the management of acute variceal bleeding.",
"A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension, obesity, and alcoholic cirrhosis is seen in clinic for follow-up. He feels well and currently drinks 5 glasses of wine each night. Medications include atenolol and lisinopril. On physical exam, temperature is 98.1 deg F (36.7 deg C), blood pressure is 151/82 mmHg, pulse is 71/min, and respirations are 14/min. He has spider angiomata on his chest; no asterixis, jaundice, ascites, or peripheral edema is noted. Screening ultrasound reveals a new liver nodule, and follow up CT demonstrates a 2 cm right hepatic lobe lesion with enhancement in the arterial phase. No hypodense attenuation is seen on the venous or delayed phase. What is the next step in management?
Options:
(A): Proceed with liver biopsy
(B): Refer for surgical resection
(C): Refer for radiofrequency ablation
(D): Treat with sorafenib
(E): Observe and get follow-up imaging in 3 months
",Proceed with liver biopsy,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Proceed with liver biopsy.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a history of alcoholic cirrhosis and a new liver nodule on imaging. The presence of a liver nodule in a patient with cirrhosis raises concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the most common primary liver malignancy. The next step in management is to proceed with a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of HCC.

Liver biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing HCC and can provide important information about the tumor's histology, grade, and stage. It can also help determine the appropriate treatment approach. In this case, a liver biopsy will help confirm the diagnosis of HCC and guide further management decisions.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in management for this patient:
- (B) Surgical resection is not the first-line treatment for HCC, especially in patients with cirrhosis. Surgical resection is typically reserved for patients with early-stage HCC and preserved liver function.
- (C) Radiofrequency ablation is a treatment option for early-stage HCC, but it should not be the first step in management. The diagnosis of HCC should be confirmed before considering ablative therapies.
- (D) Sorafenib is a systemic therapy used for advanced-stage HCC, but it is not the first-line treatment for patients with a new liver nodule. The diagnosis should be confirmed before initiating systemic therapy.
- (E) Observing and getting follow-up imaging in 3 months is not the most appropriate next step. Given the patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of a liver nodule, prompt evaluation and diagnosis are necessary to guide appropriate management.",
"A 66-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife due to abdominal distension and persistent somnolence for the past 2 weeks. The patient’s wife says that he has been sleeping much more than usual for the past 5 days. His bowel and bladder habit have not changed. His past medical history is significant for alcoholic liver cirrhosis. His vital signs include: pulse 76/min, respiratory rate 15/min, temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F) and blood pressure 122/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is altered and not responsive to commands. Oriented x 0. The abdomen is significantly distended. Shifting dullness is present and a positive fluid wave can be elicited. Hyperreflexia and asterixis are noted. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Laboratory test
Sodium 140 mEq/L
Potassium 3.5 mEq/L
Chloride 97 mEq/L
Glucose 90 mg/dL
Ammonia 100 µg/dL (ref: 19-60 µg/dL)
Arterial blood gas
pH 7.4
pCO2 40 mm Hg
pO2 90 mm Hg
HCO3 26 mEq/L
An abdominal ultrasound shows surface nodularity compatible with cirrhosis but no other changes aside from ascites. An upper GI endoscopy is performed which shows gastric varices with no signs of active bleeding. An MRI of the brain is insignificant. What is the most likely precipitating factor that led to this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
(B): Metabolic alkalosis
(C): Variceal gastrointestinal bleeding
(D): Portal vein thrombosis
(E): Hypoglycemia
",Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has signs and symptoms consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction. The most common precipitating factor for hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis is an infection, particularly spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). SBP is an infection of the ascitic fluid without an evident intra-abdominal source. It is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and altered mental status. In this case, the patient has abdominal distension, altered mental status, and laboratory findings consistent with SBP (elevated ammonia level). The presence of ascites on abdominal ultrasound further supports the diagnosis of SBP. Other precipitating factors for hepatic encephalopathy include gastrointestinal bleeding, constipation, electrolyte abnormalities, and medications. However, in this case, there are no signs of active bleeding on upper GI endoscopy and the patient's electrolyte levels are within normal limits. Therefore, the most likely precipitating factor in this patient is SBP.",
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. The patient was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head on collision. The patient’s echocardiogram (ECG) is notable only for sinus tachycardia. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given 2 liters of Ringer lactate solution and morphine. Initial workup demonstrates that the patient’s pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and troponins are elevated. The patient is currently complaining of chest pain. Physical exam is notable for an uncomfortable young man with bruising over his chest wall. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Cardiac contusion
(B): Hemorrhage
(C): Myocardial infarction
(D): Pulmonary contusion
(E): Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
",Cardiac contusion,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Cardiac contusion.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient was involved in a motor vehicle collision and presents with chest pain, elevated troponins, and bruising over the chest wall. These findings are consistent with a cardiac contusion.

Cardiac contusion refers to blunt injury to the heart muscle, typically caused by a direct impact to the chest. It can occur in high-speed motor vehicle collisions, falls from a height, or other traumatic events. The force of the impact can cause compression of the heart against the sternum, leading to injury.

The clinical presentation of a cardiac contusion can vary widely. Patients may complain of chest pain, which can be similar to that seen in myocardial infarction. ECG findings may be nonspecific, as seen in this patient with sinus tachycardia. Elevated troponin levels can also be seen, indicating myocardial injury.

Physical examination findings may include bruising over the chest wall, as seen in this patient. Other signs may include signs of cardiac dysfunction such as hypotension, tachycardia, or signs of heart failure.

It is important to note that other conditions such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary contusion, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy can also present with chest pain and elevated troponins. However, the presence of bruising over the chest wall in this patient, along with the mechanism of injury, makes cardiac contusion the most likely diagnosis.",
"A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency department for progressively worsening fatigue, malaise, fever, and abdominal pain. He reports that his symptoms began approximately 1 week ago and he has noticed episodes of diarrhea. He recently started melatonin and magnesium supplementation in hopes of improving his sleep. Medical history is significant for alcohol use disorder that required multiple hospital admissions for management of acute pancreatitis and cirrhosis. He states that he occasionally injects heroin intravenously. Temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 92/min, and respirations are 17/min. Physical examination is significant for scleral icterus, hepatomegaly, ascites, and diffuse abdominal tenderness. Laboratory testing is significant for leukocytosis and metabolic acidosis. A paracentesis is performed and he is admitted into the hospital to receive intravenous cefotaxime and albumin. Ascitic fluid analysis demonstrates a polymorphonuclear cell count of 280 cells/mm^3, serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.3 g/dL, and a culture positive for Escherichia coli sensitive to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. On hospital day 2, the nurse reports that the patient is oliguric in the setting of constant fluid intake. Physical examination is unchanged. Laboratory testing is significant for a serum sodium of 131 mEq/L and creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL (it was 0.9 mg/dL on admission). Urine studies are significant for a low urine sodium level, without evidence of blood or protein. Since the hospital admission, he has not been started on any new medications. Which of the following will be the best treatment option for this patient?
Options:
(A): Adding dopamine to his treatment regimen
(B): Adding lisinopril to his treatment regimen
(C): Liver transplantation
(D): Switching cefotaxime to ceftriaxone
(E): Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting
",Liver transplantation,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Liver transplantation.

Explanation:
This patient presents with signs and symptoms of hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which is a potentially reversible functional renal failure that occurs in patients with advanced liver disease. HRS is characterized by a rapid decline in renal function, oliguria, and low urine sodium concentration (<10 mEq/L) in the absence of other causes of renal dysfunction. The diagnosis of HRS is based on clinical criteria and exclusion of other causes of renal dysfunction. In this patient, the low urine sodium concentration and absence of blood or protein in the urine support the diagnosis of HRS. The treatment of choice for HRS is liver transplantation, as it addresses the underlying cause of the renal dysfunction. Other treatment options, such as adding dopamine or lisinopril to the treatment regimen, switching antibiotics, or performing a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, do not address the underlying liver disease and are not effective in treating HRS.",
"A 29-year-old woman presents to the clinic after several months of weight loss. She noticed a 6.8 kg (15 lb) unintentional weight loss over the preceding several months. She has not changed her diet or exercise habits. She also reports feuding with her boyfriend over the temperature of their shared apartment, as she always feels warmer than he does. The vital signs include: heart rate 110/min and blood pressure 146/78 mm Hg. The physical exam is notable for warm and slightly moist skin. She also exhibits a fine tremor in her hands when her arms are outstretched. The urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the best single treatment option for this patient?
Options:
(A): Glucocorticoids
(B): Methimazole
(C): Propranolol
(D): Radioiodine therapy
(E): Thyroidectomy
",Methimazole,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Methimazole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, she is most likely experiencing symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The weight loss, feeling warmer than others, increased heart rate, and fine tremor are all consistent with hyperthyroidism.

Methimazole is a medication that is commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism. It works by inhibiting the production of thyroid hormones, which helps to normalize the thyroid function and alleviate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Glucocorticoids (choice A) are not the best treatment option for this patient because they are used to treat conditions such as adrenal insufficiency or autoimmune diseases, not hyperthyroidism.

Propranolol (choice C) is a beta-blocker that can help control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as rapid heart rate and tremors. However, it does not address the underlying cause of hyperthyroidism and is not considered the best single treatment option.

Radioiodine therapy (choice D) and thyroidectomy (choice E) are both options for definitive treatment of hyperthyroidism, but they are typically reserved for patients who do not respond to or cannot tolerate antithyroid medications like methimazole. These options are more invasive and have potential long-term consequences, so they are not the best initial treatment choice for this patient.",
"A 21-year-old man comes to the physician because of pruritus and a hypopigmented rash on his upper body for 5 days. He first noticed the symptoms after returning from a business trip last week in the Bahamas. While he was there, he visited a couple of beaches and went hiking with some coworkers. The rash initially started as a single lesion on his upper back but since then has extended to his shoulders. He has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus controlled with an insulin pump. He works as an office manager and has no known exposure to melanocytotoxic chemicals. He has been sexually active with three female partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently. He is 183 cm (6 ft) tall and weighs 80 kg (176 lb); BMI is 23.9 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. A photograph of the rash is shown. One month ago, his hemoglobin A1C was 7.8%. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Wood lamp examination
(B): Skin culture
(C): Potassium hydroxide preparation
(D): Skin biopsy
(E): Antinuclear antibody testing
""
",Potassium hydroxide preparation,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Potassium hydroxide preparation.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and presentation, the most likely diagnosis is tinea versicolor, a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia species. The hypopigmented rash, pruritus, and recent travel to a tropical location are consistent with this diagnosis. Tinea versicolor is commonly seen in individuals with oily skin, excessive sweating, and immunosuppression, such as in patients with diabetes mellitus. The diagnosis of tinea versicolor is confirmed by performing a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of skin scrapings from the affected area. The KOH preparation allows for visualization of the characteristic ""spaghetti and meatballs"" appearance, which represents the hyphae and spores of the fungus. Other diagnostic modalities, such as dermoscopy, wood lamp examination, skin culture, skin biopsy, and antinuclear antibody testing, are not necessary for the diagnosis of tinea versicolor.",
"A 5-year-old female is brought to a speech therapist for continuing work on improving her communication skills. She is only able to verbalize two word sentences and has generalized developmental delay. When she was born it was noticed that she had a high pitched mewing cry and subsequent physical exam revealed microcephaly, prominent epicanthal folds, and a holosystolic murmur best heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum. An abnormality of which of the following chromosomes is most likely responsible for this patient's disorder?
Options:
(A): 5
(B): 7
(C): 13
(D): 18
(E): 21
",5,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) 5.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Cri-du-chat syndrome, which is caused by a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-). This syndrome is characterized by a high-pitched mewing cry in infancy, microcephaly, developmental delay, and distinctive facial features such as prominent epicanthal folds. The holosystolic murmur heard in the left 5th intercostal space near the sternum is likely due to a congenital heart defect, which is commonly associated with this syndrome. Therefore, the abnormality of chromosome 5 is most likely responsible for this patient's disorder.",
"A 62-year old female comes to the physician because of vaginal spotting and urinary urgency for the past 4 days. She has had no fever, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. Her last Pap smear 1 year ago was normal. She has hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes. Medications include atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and aspirin. She is sexually active with her husband. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 155/65 mm Hg. Pelvic exam demonstrates a 4 x 3 cm firm, immobile erythematous mass on the right inner vaginal wall. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Pap smear
(B): Biopsy of the mass
(C): Loop electrosurgical excision procedure
(D): Incision and drainage
(E): Urine gonorrhea and chlamydia testing
",Biopsy of the mass,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Biopsy of the mass.

Explanation:
Given the patient's age, postmenopausal status, and the presence of a firm, immobile erythematous mass on the vaginal wall, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform a biopsy of the mass. This is because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are concerning for a possible malignancy, such as vaginal cancer. Biopsy of the mass will allow for histopathological examination to determine the nature of the mass and guide further management. 

A Pap smear (choice A) is not the most appropriate next step in management because it is a screening test for cervical cancer and may not provide sufficient information about the nature of the vaginal mass.

A loop electrosurgical excision procedure (choice C) is a surgical procedure used for the treatment of cervical dysplasia and is not indicated in this patient with a vaginal mass.

Incision and drainage (choice D) is not indicated in this patient as there is no evidence of an abscess or infection.

Urine gonorrhea and chlamydia testing (choice E) is not indicated in this patient as her symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with a genitourinary infection.",
"A 59-year-old man is evaluated for progressive joint pain. There is swelling and tenderness over the first, second, and third metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. His hand radiograph is shown. He has had diabetes mellitus for 2 years which is not well controlled with medications. Lab studies show a transferrin saturation of 88% and serum ferritin of 1,200 ng/mL. Which of the following best represents the etiology of this patient condition?
Options:
(A): Deposition of urate crystals
(B): Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals
(C): Degenerative joint disorder
(D): Inflammatory rheumatological syndrome
(E): Pathogenic inoculation of microbes
",Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of joint pain, swelling, and tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal joints, along with the radiographic findings of beak-like osteophytes, subchondral cysts, and osteopenia, are consistent with calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease. CPPD disease is characterized by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and joint damage.

The presence of diabetes mellitus and poorly controlled blood sugar levels may contribute to the development of CPPD disease. Diabetes is a risk factor for the development of crystal deposition diseases, including CPPD disease. Elevated levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation may also be seen in patients with CPPD disease, as iron overload can contribute to crystal formation.

Deposition of urate crystals (option A) is seen in gout, which typically presents with acute episodes of joint pain, redness, and swelling. This patient's presentation is more consistent with a chronic, progressive joint disorder.

Degenerative joint disorder (option C) refers to osteoarthritis, which is characterized by joint degeneration and cartilage loss. While this patient may have some features of osteoarthritis on radiographic imaging, the presence of beak-like osteophytes and subchondral cysts is more suggestive of CPPD disease.

Inflammatory rheumatological syndrome (option D) is a broad term that can encompass various autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the patient's presentation and radiographic findings are not consistent with these conditions.

Pathogenic inoculation of microbes (option E) would suggest an infectious etiology, such as septic arthritis. However, there is no mention of signs of infection, such as fever or systemic symptoms, and the radiographic findings are not consistent with septic arthritis.",
"A newborn is found to be extremely cyanotic immediately after birth. He then develops progressive respiratory failure and is admitted to the neonatal ICU. A single loud S2 heart sound is appreciated as well as a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. Radiography shows an enlarged ""egg-shaped"" heart. The newborn is then taken for a atrial septostomy to alleviate the condition pending definitive surgical correction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this newborn's condition?
Options:
(A): Coarctation of the aorta
(B): Persistent truncus arteriosus
(C): Tetralogy of Fallot
(D): Transposition of great vessels
(E): Tricuspid atresia
",Transposition of great vessels,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Transposition of great vessels.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this newborn, including extreme cyanosis immediately after birth, progressive respiratory failure, a single loud S2 heart sound, and a machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border, is consistent with transposition of the great vessels.

Transposition of the great vessels is a congenital heart defect in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle, resulting in a complete separation of the systemic and pulmonary circulations. This leads to cyanosis and respiratory distress shortly after birth.

The enlarged ""egg-shaped"" heart seen on radiography is a characteristic finding in transposition of the great vessels. This is due to the abnormal positioning of the great vessels, resulting in an abnormal cardiac silhouette.

Atrial septostomy is a procedure performed to alleviate the condition temporarily by creating an atrial communication, allowing for mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. This is done as a bridge to definitive surgical correction.

Coarctation of the aorta (option A) is unlikely in this case as it typically presents with differential pulses and not with cyanosis and respiratory failure.

Persistent truncus arteriosus (option B) is also unlikely as it presents with a loud single S2 heart sound and a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the upper left sternal border, but not with cyanosis and respiratory failure.

Tetralogy of Fallot (option C) is the most common form of cyanotic heart disease, but the obstruction at the pulmonary valve is often not severe enough to result in cyanosis in the newborn. Additionally, the characteristic findings of tetralogy of Fallot, such as a boot-shaped heart on radiography and right ventricular hypertrophy on ECG, are not mentioned in the clinical presentation.

Tricuspid atresia (option E) is unlikely as it typically presents with cyanosis and respiratory distress shortly after birth, but the clinical findings described in the question stem, such as a single loud S2 heart sound and a machine-like murmur, are not consistent with tricuspid atresia.",
"A 25-year-old male involved in a knife fight presents with a penetrating wound to the chest. The patient is unconscious and cannot provide any further history. Vitals show a temperature of 37-0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 85/55 mm Hg, pulse of 115/min, respirations of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 92% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is diaphoretic and unresponsive. Extremities are pale and cool. There is a 3-inch long penetrating wound between the 3rd and 4th intercostal space on the left side of the chest, which is bleeding profusely. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. There are no apparent injuries to any coronary arteries or major branches. The patient is intubated and aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated, including a blood transfusion. Which of the following is the best definitive surgical approach to take in this patient?
Options:
(A): Immediate cardiac transplant
(B): Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated
(C): Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets
(D): Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space
(E): Surgical adhesive glue
",Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has a penetrating wound to the chest with profuse bleeding and a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. The patient is hemodynamically unstable with hypotension, tachycardia, and signs of poor perfusion. The best definitive surgical approach in this patient is to perform an interrupted 2-0 polypropylene suture with supporting pledgets.

The goal of surgical management in this case is to control the bleeding and repair the cardiac injury. Interrupted sutures with supporting pledgets are commonly used to repair penetrating cardiac injuries. The sutures provide hemostasis and closure of the defect, while the pledgets provide additional support and prevent suture pull-through.

Immediate cardiac transplant (A) is not indicated in this patient as it is a highly invasive procedure and is not necessary for the management of a penetrating cardiac injury.

Watchful waiting while resuscitative fluids are initiated (B) is not appropriate in this case as the patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires immediate surgical intervention to control the bleeding.

Needle thoracostomy over the 2nd intercostal space (D) is a procedure used to decompress tension pneumothorax, not to repair a penetrating cardiac injury. It is not the appropriate surgical approach in this scenario.

Surgical adhesive glue (E) is not the best definitive surgical approach for a full thickness penetrating injury to the right ventricular free wall. Sutures are required to provide hemostasis and closure of the defect.",
"A post-mortem lung examination of a 68-year-old male overweight male with evidence of chronic lower extremity edema, a 60 pack-year smoking history and daily productive cough would be most likely to reveal:
Options:
(A): Hypereosinophilia
(B): Reid Index > 50%
(C): Non-caseating granulomas
(D): Evidence of a necrotizing infection
(E): Keratin pearls
",Reid Index > 50%,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Reid Index > 50%.

Explanation:
The Reid Index is a measure of the thickness of the mucous glands in the bronchial wall compared to the thickness of the bronchial wall itself. A Reid Index greater than 50% is indicative of chronic bronchitis, which is characterized by excessive mucus production and inflammation of the bronchial tubes.

In this case, the patient has a history of chronic lower extremity edema, which can be a sign of heart failure. The daily productive cough and smoking history also suggest chronic bronchitis. Therefore, a post-mortem lung examination would most likely reveal a Reid Index greater than 50%, confirming the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis.",
"A 54-year-old male makes an appointment with his primary care physician due to chronic fatigue that has left him unable to hike or do other physically demanding activities with his friends. He has well-controlled hypertension and diabetes but has otherwise been healthy. He does not smoke but drinks socially with his friends. Physical exam reveals enlarged nodules that are not tender to palpation. A biopsy is obtained showing a characteristic change in chromosome 18. The regulation of which of the following proteins will be most abnormal in this patient?
Options:
(A): Caspase-8
(B): Caspase-9
(C): CD15
(D): Cyclin-dependent kinase 4
(E): Ras pathway transcription factors
",Caspase-9,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Caspase-9.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of chronic fatigue, enlarged nodules, and characteristic change in chromosome 18 suggests a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells, specifically B lymphocytes. 

Caspases are a family of proteins that play a crucial role in apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Caspase-8 and caspase-9 are two important members of this family. Caspase-8 is involved in the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which is triggered by external signals. Caspase-9, on the other hand, is involved in the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, which is triggered by internal signals such as DNA damage or cellular stress.

In CLL, there is an abnormality in chromosome 18, which often involves a deletion of a portion of the long arm of the chromosome (del(18q)). This deletion can lead to dysregulation of caspase-9, resulting in impaired apoptosis and the accumulation of abnormal lymphocytes.

Therefore, in this patient with CLL and a characteristic change in chromosome 18, the regulation of caspase-9 will be most abnormal.",
"A 44-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She is concerned about cancer because her uncle died of metastatic melanoma 1 year ago. She has no history of serious illness and does not take any medication. She has been working in a law firm for the past 20 years and travels to the Carribean regularly with her husband. Examination of her skin shows no abnormal moles or warts. This woman is at greatest risk of which of the following types of melanoma?
Options:
(A): Desmoplastic
(B): Nodular
(C): Acral lentiginous
(D): Lentigo maligna
(E): Superficial spreading
",Acral lentiginous,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Acral lentiginous.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the woman is African-American and has no abnormal moles or warts on her skin. Acral lentiginous melanoma is a subtype of melanoma that primarily affects individuals with darker skin types, such as African-Americans. It commonly occurs on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and under the nails. This subtype is not related to sun exposure, which is consistent with the woman's history of working indoors and traveling to the Caribbean. Therefore, she is at greatest risk of acral lentiginous melanoma.",
"A 60-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her daughter for evaluation. The daughter reports that her mother has recently been having difficulty combing her hair in the mornings. The patient’s family history is significant for an ischemic stroke in her father. The patient’s past medical history is positive for diverticulosis. She takes no medication. Her blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, and temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F). On physical examination, the patient’s neck is stiff and she also has bilateral shoulder tenderness; muscle strength is intact. Laboratory work is performed and presented below:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 37.7% 
Leukocyte count 5,500/mm3
Neutrophils 65%
Lymphocytes 30%
Monocytes 5%
Mean corpuscular volume 82.2 μm3
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 65 mm/h
C-reactive protein 44 mg/dL
For which of the symptoms below should the patient be screened?
Options:
(A): Uveitis
(B): Jaw claudication
(C): Heliotrope rash
(D): Gastroesophageal reflux
(E): Pink plaques with silvery scales
",Jaw claudication,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Jaw claudication.

Jaw claudication refers to pain in the jaw muscles that occurs with chewing or talking. It is a common symptom of giant cell arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis. GCA is an inflammatory condition that affects the medium and large arteries, particularly the temporal arteries. It is more common in individuals over the age of 50, and women are affected more often than men.

In this case, the patient is a 60-year-old woman who presents with difficulty combing her hair in the mornings. This symptom, along with the presence of a stiff neck and bilateral shoulder tenderness, raises suspicion for GCA. Other symptoms of GCA may include headache, scalp tenderness, vision changes, fatigue, and weight loss.

The laboratory findings in this patient are also consistent with GCA. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels indicate an inflammatory process. These markers are often elevated in GCA.

Therefore, given the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, she should be screened for jaw claudication to further evaluate for the possibility of GCA.",
"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been unable to conceive for 3 years. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts during this time. The patient also reports episodic pelvic and back pain accompanied by painful diarrhea for 5 years. She has about one such episode on average per month for 4–6 days. She has taken ibuprofen for the pain, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 29-day intervals since menarche at the age of 14 years and last for 7 days. She is sexually active with her husband and does not use contraception. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic and bimanual examinations are normal; rectal examination is unremarkable. A hysterosalpingogram 6 months prior showed normal results. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Loss of fallopian tube function following infection
(B): Smooth muscle tumor arising from the myometrium
(C): Increased secretion of prolactin
(D): Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity
(E): Increased secretion of androgens and luteinizing hormone
",Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms are consistent with endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue, which normally lines the inside of the uterus, grows outside the uterus. This tissue can implant and grow on the pelvic organs, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the peritoneum. 

The patient's symptoms of pelvic and back pain, painful diarrhea, and painful periods are classic symptoms of endometriosis. The pain is typically cyclical and occurs around the time of menstruation. The pain can be caused by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which responds to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.

The patient's inability to conceive for 3 years may also be related to endometriosis. Endometriosis can cause infertility by affecting the function of the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and uterus. The presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus can lead to the formation of adhesions and scar tissue, which can block the fallopian tubes and prevent the sperm from reaching the egg.

The hysterosalpingogram, which showed normal results, suggests that the fallopian tubes are not the cause of the patient's infertility. This further supports the diagnosis of endometriosis as the underlying mechanism of her symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity.",
"A 55-year-old truck driver is brought to a physician by his wife. She states that her husband developed a fever and began feeling weak 3 days ago, but has refused medical help. He has been unable to go to work because of his symptoms. The patient has been previously hospitalized for a tricuspid valve replacement surgery 1 year ago and takes aspirin daily. The medical history is also relevant for myocardial infarction 3 years ago and hypertension for the past 10 years, for which he takes lisinopril. His blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg, the pulse is 82/min, the respirations are 18/minute, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). On examination, several hemorrhages are noted on the nail beds of several fingers. Which of the following findings would be most helpful in establishing a diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Thickened valve with multiple small vegetations
(B): Bicuspid valve
(C): Friable irregular masses attached to the valve
(D): Papillary muscle rupture
(E): Annular calcification
",Friable irregular masses attached to the valve,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Friable irregular masses attached to the valve.

Explanation:
The patient's history of tricuspid valve replacement surgery and the presence of fever, weakness, and nail bed hemorrhages suggest infective endocarditis. The most common cause of infective endocarditis in patients with prosthetic valves is Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is a common skin commensal. The presence of friable irregular masses attached to the valve is consistent with infective endocarditis. These masses, known as vegetations, are composed of fibrin, platelets, and microorganisms. They can embolize, leading to systemic complications such as septic emboli and abscess formation. Thickened valve with multiple small vegetations (choice A) is more characteristic of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, which is associated with hypercoagulable states such as malignancy. Bicuspid valve (choice B) is a congenital abnormality and is not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the patient. Papillary muscle rupture (choice D) is a complication of myocardial infarction and would present with acute onset of severe mitral regurgitation and pulmonary edema. Annular calcification (choice E) is a degenerative process seen in elderly patients and is not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the patient.",
"A previously healthy 30-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of pain during sexual intercourse for 6 months. She also reports frequent episodes of crampy pelvic pain that starts one day before menses and lasts for 7 days. Her symptoms are not relieved with pain medication. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband. She uses a combined oral contraceptive pill. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows rectovaginal tenderness. Cervical and urethral swabs are negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Measurement of CA-125 levels
(B): Hysterectomy
(C): Laparoscopy
(D): Hysteroscopy
(E): CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis
",Laparoscopy,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Laparoscopy.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of pain during sexual intercourse, crampy pelvic pain before menses, and rectovaginal tenderness are suggestive of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus, leading to pain and other symptoms.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are not relieved with pain medication, and the physical examination findings are consistent with endometriosis. Transvaginal ultrasonography may not always detect endometriosis, as the implants can be small and difficult to visualize.

Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis. It involves making small incisions in the abdomen and inserting a camera to visualize the pelvic organs. During laparoscopy, the surgeon can directly visualize and biopsy any endometrial implants to confirm the diagnosis.

Measurement of CA-125 levels (option A) is not the most appropriate next step in management. CA-125 is a tumor marker that can be elevated in certain conditions, including endometriosis. However, CA-125 levels are not specific for endometriosis and can also be elevated in other conditions, such as ovarian cancer. Therefore, CA-125 levels alone are not sufficient for diagnosing endometriosis.

Hysterectomy (option B) is not indicated as the initial management for endometriosis. Hysterectomy involves the removal of the uterus and is a more definitive treatment option for patients who have completed childbearing and have severe symptoms that are not responsive to conservative management.

Hysteroscopy (option D) is a procedure that involves inserting a thin, lighted tube through the vagina and cervix to visualize the inside of the uterus. It is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient because her symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of endometriosis, which involves the tissue outside the uterus.

CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (option E) is not the most appropriate next step in management. While a CT scan can provide detailed images of the abdomen and pelvis, it is not the first-line diagnostic modality for endometriosis. Laparoscopy is the preferred method for visualizing and diagnosing endometriosis.",
"A 50-year-old man visits his physician after 20 years of not seeking any medical care. He is concerned about his health after a colleague recently had a heart attack. The patient has no active complaints and says he feels healthy; however, he does not exercise regularly and lives a sedentary lifestyle. He is employed as an administrative position at a local college, and is seated at a desk most of the day. His father had a heart attack at age 54 and his mother is still alive with no health concerns. He does not smoke, only drinks socially, and does not use drugs. Today, his blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination reveals an obese male with no significant findings. An ECG shows no abnormalities, and laboratory testing shows the following:
Laboratory test
Serum glucose (fasting)  105 mg/dL
Serum electrolytes 
Sodium  142 mEq/L
Potassium 3.9 mEq/L
Chloride 101 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl

LDL-cholesterol 186 mg/dL
Triglycerides 170 mg/dL
Urinalysis 
Glucose  negative
Ketones negative
Leucocytes negative
Nitrites negative 
Red blood cells (RBC) negative 
Casts negative 
Which of the following lab abnormalities in this patient is an indication for treatment?
Options:
(A): Blood pressure reading
(B): Patient’s weight
(C): High triglyceride levels
(D): High LDL-cholesterol
(E): Serum glucose level
",High LDL-cholesterol,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): High LDL-cholesterol.

Explanation:
High LDL-cholesterol levels are an indication for treatment in this patient. LDL-cholesterol is commonly referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol because it contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. In this patient, the LDL-cholesterol level is 186 mg/dL, which is above the recommended target level of less than 100 mg/dL for individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Given the patient's sedentary lifestyle, family history of heart disease, and high total cholesterol level, it is important to address the elevated LDL-cholesterol to reduce his risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment options may include lifestyle modifications such as dietary changes and increased physical activity, as well as medication therapy if necessary.",
"A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 20 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was a restrained passenger. On arrival, she is lethargic and incoherent. She has severe facial lacerations and is in respiratory distress. Her pulse is 130/min, respirations are 29/min, and blood pressure is 90/58 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 70%. Examination shows multiple facial lacerations. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the left lung base. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 12.1 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows a fractured left second rib, depression of the left mainstem bronchus, deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right, and a widened mediastinum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Diaphragmatic rupture
(B): Traumatic bronchial rupture
(C): Thoracic aortic rupture
(D): Cardiac tamponade
(E): Tension pneumothorax
",Thoracic aortic rupture,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Thoracic aortic rupture.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with multiple signs and symptoms that are consistent with a thoracic aortic rupture. The mechanism of injury, a high-speed motor vehicle collision, is a common cause of thoracic aortic rupture. The patient's presentation of lethargy, incoherence, severe facial lacerations, and respiratory distress suggests significant trauma. The vital signs, including tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension, are indicative of shock. The decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the left lung base suggest a hemothorax, which can occur with aortic rupture. The widened mediastinum on chest x-ray is a classic finding in thoracic aortic rupture. The other options listed, including diaphragmatic rupture, traumatic bronchial rupture, cardiac tamponade, and tension pneumothorax, do not fully explain the patient's presentation and findings.",
"A 26-year-old G1P0 woman presents to her primary care physician’s office with feelings of anxiety and trouble with sleep. She finds it difficult initiating sleep, occasionally has palpitations, and feels fatigued. She denies having similar symptoms in the past or starting any new medications or illicit drugs. She is currently 10 weeks pregnant and is closely followed by her obstetrician. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 125/70 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical exam, the patient is mildly diaphoretic. The skin is warm and the thyroid gland is diffusely enlarged with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies are significant for a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.01 µU/mL (normal is 0.5-5.0 µU/mL) and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) that is inappropriate for her pregnancy. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?
Options:
(A): Methimazole
(B): Observation
(C): Propylthiouracil
(D): Radioiodine therapy
(E): Thyroidectomy
",Propylthiouracil,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Propylthiouracil.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, including anxiety, trouble with sleep, palpitations, and fatigue. On physical examination, she has a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with thyroid bruits. Laboratory studies show a low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level and an elevated free thyroxine (FT4) level, which is inappropriate for her pregnancy.

Propylthiouracil is the best treatment option for this patient. It is an antithyroid medication that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones by blocking the enzyme thyroperoxidase. It is safe to use during pregnancy and is the preferred treatment option in the first trimester. Methimazole, another antithyroid medication, is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy due to an increased risk of congenital abnormalities. Radioiodine therapy and thyroidectomy are not recommended during pregnancy.

Observation alone is not appropriate in this case because the patient is symptomatic and her thyroid function tests are abnormal. Prompt treatment is necessary to control her hyperthyroidism and prevent complications.",
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of intermittent loose stools and a 1.2-kg (2.6-lb) weight loss. She immigrated to the US from Uganda 6 weeks ago. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. The liver is firm and palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpable just below the left costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,800/mm3 (12% eosinophils). Stool culture shows several oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines. Microscopic examination of a liver biopsy specimen shows granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis. Exposure to which of the following is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Tsetse flies
(B): Undercooked pork meat
(C): Undercooked fish meat
(D): Dog feces
(E): Freshwater snails
",Freshwater snails,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Freshwater snails.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including intermittent loose stools, weight loss, diffuse tenderness on abdominal examination, palpable liver and spleen, and elevated leukocyte count with eosinophilia, are consistent with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is caused by infection with parasitic worms called schistosomes, which are transmitted through contact with contaminated freshwater. The eggs of the schistosomes are released into the water through the feces or urine of infected individuals. These eggs hatch into larvae (miracidia) that infect freshwater snails. The larvae then develop into cercariae, which are released from the snails into the water. Human infection occurs when individuals come into contact with contaminated water, such as by swimming or bathing in freshwater lakes or rivers.

Once inside the human body, the cercariae penetrate the skin and migrate to the liver, where they mature into adult worms. The adult worms then migrate to the veins of the intestines or bladder, where they lay eggs. The eggs can cause inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, leading to hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.

The presence of oval-shaped eggs with lateral spines in the stool culture and granulomatous inflammation with periportal fibrosis on liver biopsy are consistent with schistosomiasis. Additionally, the patient's recent immigration from Uganda, where schistosomiasis is endemic, further supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, exposure to freshwater snails is most likely to have played a role in the development of this patient's symptoms.",
"A 3-month-old girl is brought to a pediatrician by her parents. She has central cyanosis without signs of respiratory distress or signs of heart failure. An echocardiogram reveals severe pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding of the aorta. An elective primary surgical repair is planned at 4 months of age. Which of the following statements is true about this girl’s condition?
Options:
(A): The tricuspid valve is the most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot.
(B): Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.
(C): Cerebral arterial thrombosis is more common than cerebral venous thrombosis.
(D): Refractory heart failure is a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot.
(E): The most common age of presentation for brain abscess is between 6 and 12 months.
",Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Normal hemoglobin in patients with tetralogy of Fallot does not rule out iron deficiency anemia.

Explanation:
Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by four anatomical abnormalities: pulmonary outflow obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, a ventricular septal defect, and an overriding aorta. In this condition, blood flow to the lungs is decreased, leading to cyanosis. 

Iron deficiency anemia is a common condition in infants and children, and it can coexist with tetralogy of Fallot. Normal hemoglobin levels in patients with tetralogy of Fallot do not rule out iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia can occur due to inadequate iron intake, poor absorption, or increased iron requirements. It is important to assess iron status in patients with tetralogy of Fallot and provide appropriate supplementation if necessary.

The other options are incorrect because:
(A) The tricuspid valve is not the most common valve affected by bacterial endocarditis in uncorrected tetralogy of Fallot. Bacterial endocarditis can affect any valve, but it is more commonly associated with the pulmonary valve in patients with tetralogy of Fallot.
(C) Cerebral arterial thrombosis and cerebral venous thrombosis are both potential complications of tetralogy of Fallot, but there is no evidence to suggest that one is more common than the other.
(D) Refractory heart failure is not a common complication of tetralogy of Fallot. Heart failure can occur in severe cases of tetralogy of Fallot, but it is not a common complication.
(E) The most common age of presentation for brain abscess is not between 6 and 12 months. Brain abscess can occur at any age and is not specifically associated with tetralogy of Fallot.",
"Six days after undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture, a previously healthy 79-year-old woman is agitated and confused. She is unarousable during the day, but then is awake and impulsive during the night, requiring frequent reorientation. Her husband says that she usually drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Her only current medication is oxycodone for pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits. She is distressed and oriented to person but not to place or time. Neurologic examination shows inattentiveness but no focal deficits. Urine dipstick is normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her current condition?
Options:
(A): Dementia
(B): Alcohol withdrawal
(C): Opioid intoxication
(D): Delirium
(E): Urinary tract infection
",Delirium,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Delirium.

Explanation:
Delirium is the most likely cause of the patient's current condition. Delirium is a state of acute confusion and altered consciousness that is often caused by an underlying medical condition or medication. In this case, the patient's symptoms of agitation, confusion, and inattentiveness are consistent with delirium. The fact that she is unarousable during the day and awake and impulsive at night suggests a disturbance in her sleep-wake cycle, which is common in delirium.

The patient's history of undergoing surgical repair of a hip fracture and her use of oxycodone for pain are important clues. Surgery and the use of opioids can both contribute to the development of delirium. Additionally, the patient's age of 79 years is a risk factor for delirium, as older adults are more susceptible to developing this condition.

The other options can be ruled out based on the information provided:
- Dementia is a chronic condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline, whereas delirium is an acute confusional state. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with delirium than dementia.
- Alcohol withdrawal typically occurs in individuals with a history of heavy alcohol use who abruptly stop drinking. The patient's history of drinking one to two glasses of wine weekly is unlikely to cause alcohol withdrawal.
- Opioid intoxication can cause sedation and respiratory depression, but it is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms of agitation and confusion.
- Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with schizophrenia.
- While a urinary tract infection (UTI) can cause confusion in older adults, the patient's normal urine dipstick makes a UTI less likely as the primary cause of her symptoms.",
"A 54-year-old woman with a past medical history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes presents to the emergency department with a change in her behavior. Her caretakers state that the patient’s gait suddenly became ataxic, and she became less responsive than her normal non-verbal baseline. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 125/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an unremarkable HEENT exam with normal facial features and no signs of airway compromise. Neurological exam is remarkable for new onset spasticity. The patient has 3+ reflexes and a positive Babinski sign. Musculoskeletal exam is only notable for symmetric swelling and deformities of the patient’s hands bilaterally. Additionally, there is a ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine. Which of the following is the most likely risk factor that predisposed this patient to this condition?
Options:
(A): Cerebral palsy
(B): Diabetes mellitus
(C): Down syndrome
(D): Hypertension
(E): Rheumatoid arthritis
",Rheumatoid arthritis,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Rheumatoid arthritis.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a history of mental retardation, hypertension, and diabetes, but the most likely risk factor that predisposed her to her current condition is rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the joints, causing inflammation, pain, and deformities. In this case, the patient has symmetric swelling and deformities of the hands, which are characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the ""clunk"" when posterior force is applied to the head while anterior force is applied to the cervical spine suggests atlantoaxial instability, which is a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. This instability can compress the spinal cord and lead to neurological symptoms such as spasticity and ataxia, which the patient is experiencing. The positive Babinski sign and increased reflexes are also consistent with spinal cord compression. Therefore, rheumatoid arthritis is the most likely risk factor in this patient's case.",
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after he sustained a stab wound to the left chest just below the clavicle. On arrival, he has rapid, shallow breathing and appears anxious. His pulse is 135/min, respirations are 30/min and shallow, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 80 mm Hg. He is intubated and mechanically ventilated. Infusion of 0.9% saline is begun. Five minutes later, his pulse is 133/min and blood pressure is 82/45 mm Hg. Examination shows no active external bleeding. There is a 2.5-cm single stab wound to the left chest at the 4th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiovascular examination shows muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention. Breath sounds are normal. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Tracheal deviation toward the right side
(B): Hemoptysis
(C): A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration
(D): Herniation of the stomach into the chest
(E): Paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing
""
",A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): A drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient has sustained a stab wound to the left chest, resulting in symptoms of rapid, shallow breathing, anxiety, tachycardia, and hypotension. The physical examination findings of muffled heart sounds and jugular venous distention suggest the presence of a tension pneumothorax.

In a tension pneumothorax, air accumulates in the pleural space and causes a shift of the mediastinum to the opposite side. This can compress the great vessels and impair venous return to the heart, leading to decreased cardiac output and hypotension. The drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration is a classic finding in tension pneumothorax.

Tracheal deviation toward the right side (option A) is not likely in this case, as there is no mention of any abnormal tracheal position.

Hemoptysis (option B) refers to coughing up blood, which is not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

Herniation of the stomach into the chest (option D) is not likely in this case, as there is no mention of any gastrointestinal symptoms or findings.

Paradoxical motion of part of the chest with breathing (option E) refers to a condition called flail chest, which is characterized by multiple rib fractures resulting in a segment of the chest wall moving in the opposite direction to the rest of the chest during respiration. This is not likely in this case, as there is no mention of any chest wall abnormalities or trauma.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is a drop in systolic blood pressure of 14 mmHg during inspiration, indicating a tension pneumothorax.",
"A 40-year-old man presents to his primary-care doctor for a follow-up of his hypertension. He is asymptomatic at his office visit and denies any new complaints. He has a 10-year history of hypertension that remains poorly controlled on maximum doses of lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and amlodipine. His past medical history is otherwise unremarkable. He has no smoking history, drinks alcohol occasionally, and denies any illicit drug use. His father required a kidney transplant in his forties. The physical exam is notable for palpable flank masses bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a creatinine of 2.5. The physician orders a renal ultrasound, and the results are shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to screen for additional complications of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Colonoscopy
(B): Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(C): Liver function tests
(D): MR angiography of the brain
(E): Serum amylase and lipase
",MR angiography of the brain,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) MR angiography of the brain.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is polycystic kidney disease (PKD). PKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It is associated with hypertension, as seen in this patient, and can lead to progressive kidney damage and renal failure.

The presence of palpable flank masses and an elevated creatinine level further support the diagnosis of PKD. However, PKD is not only limited to the kidneys. It can also affect other organs, including the brain.

One of the potential complications of PKD is the development of intracranial aneurysms. These aneurysms can be asymptomatic until they rupture, leading to a potentially life-threatening condition called subarachnoid hemorrhage. Therefore, it is important to screen for the presence of intracranial aneurysms in patients with PKD.

MR angiography of the brain is the most appropriate test to screen for intracranial aneurysms in this patient. It is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the blood vessels in the brain, allowing for the detection of aneurysms.

Colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy are not indicated in this patient as there are no symptoms or risk factors suggestive of gastrointestinal pathology.

Liver function tests are not necessary in this patient as there are no symptoms or risk factors suggestive of liver disease.

Serum amylase and lipase are tests used to evaluate for pancreatic pathology, such as pancreatitis. There are no symptoms or risk factors suggestive of pancreatic disease in this patient.",
"A 17-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her father because she has been experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. She says that the chest pain is worse when she breathes or coughs. Furthermore, on the way to the hospital she noticed that there were specks of blood on a tissue that she coughed into. She has no previous medical history and does not recall anything that could have provoked these symptoms. On presentation her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg, pulse is 102/min, respirations are 21/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Further testing shows a large filling defect in the pulmonary vessels, and the patient is started on an appropriate treatment intravenously. After drug administration, the effects of the drug are monitored using a standard blood test. Surprisingly, the test results come back within normal parameters. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms has which of the following modes of inheritance?
Options:
(A): Autosomal dominant
(B): Autosomal recessive
(C): Autosomal partial dominance
(D): X-linked dominant
(E): X-linked recessive
",Autosomal dominant,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Autosomal dominant.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including shortness of breath, chest pain worsened by breathing or coughing, and the presence of blood in her coughed-up tissue, are consistent with a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot, usually from the deep veins of the legs, travels to the pulmonary arteries and blocks blood flow to the lungs. The large filling defect seen on further testing confirms the presence of a blood clot in the pulmonary vessels.

Autosomal dominant inheritance means that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease. In this case, the patient's symptoms are likely due to an inherited clotting disorder, such as factor V Leiden mutation or antithrombin III deficiency, which are both autosomal dominant disorders. These disorders increase the risk of developing blood clots, including pulmonary embolism.

The fact that the patient's symptoms are not provoked by any known trigger and that her blood test results are within normal parameters after treatment suggest an underlying genetic cause rather than an acquired condition. Autosomal recessive, autosomal partial dominance, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive inheritance patterns are less likely in this case, as they are not commonly associated with clotting disorders that present with the symptoms described.",
"A 26-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with complaints of burning with urination, penile discharge, and intermittent fevers. A urethral smear shows gram negative diplococci within white blood cells. The organism grows well when cultured on Thayer-Martin agar. The patient is prescribed a course of ceftriaxone and the infection resolves without further complication. One year later, the patient returns with the same infection. Which of the following best explains this lack of lasting immunity?
Options:
(A): Exotoxin release
(B): Antigenic variation
(C): Polysaccharide capsule
(D): Bruton's agammaglobulinemia
(E): Lack of necessary vaccination
",Antigenic variation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Antigenic variation.

Explanation:
Antigenic variation refers to the ability of certain pathogens to change their surface antigens in order to evade the immune response. In this case, the patient presents with symptoms of a urinary tract infection caused by gram-negative diplococci, which is most likely Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This bacterium is known to undergo antigenic variation, specifically in its surface protein called the pilin. The pilin protein is responsible for mediating attachment to host cells and is a target for the immune system. However, N. gonorrhoeae can alter the structure of its pilin protein through genetic recombination, leading to the production of different variants. This allows the bacterium to evade the immune response and establish reinfection even after a previous episode of infection and treatment.

Exotoxin release (A) is not the correct answer because it does not explain the lack of lasting immunity in this case. Exotoxins are toxins released by certain bacteria that can cause damage to host tissues, but they do not directly affect the immune response or the development of immunity.

Polysaccharide capsule (C) is not the correct answer because it also does not explain the lack of lasting immunity. Polysaccharide capsules can help bacteria evade the immune system by preventing phagocytosis, but they do not directly affect the development of immunity.

Bruton's agammaglobulinemia (D) is not the correct answer because it is a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of B cells and immunoglobulins, leading to a deficiency in antibody production. This condition would result in a general lack of immune response, rather than a lack of lasting immunity specifically against N. gonorrhoeae.

Lack of necessary vaccination (E) is not the correct answer because it assumes that there is a vaccine available for N. gonorrhoeae, which is not the case. Currently, there is no vaccine available for this bacterium.",
"A 37-year-old man with no significant past medical history is rear-ended in a motor vehicle accident. He reported significant neck pain to emergency responders, but otherwise denies weakness, numbness or tingling in his extremities. His vitals on presentation to the ED are HR 90, BP 140/80, RR 20, SpO2 98%. What is the most appropriate next step upon presentation to the emergency room?
Options:
(A): Lateral cervical film
(B): Three view cervical spine series
(C): Cervical immobilization
(D): IV methylprednisolone
(E): Observation overnight
",Cervical immobilization,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Cervical immobilization.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is a 37-year-old man who was rear-ended in a motor vehicle accident and presents with significant neck pain. However, he denies weakness, numbness, or tingling in his extremities. His vital signs are stable. 

Based on the provided context information, the patient meets the low-risk criteria for cervical spine injury evaluation. These criteria include a simple rear-end motor vehicle accident, the ability to sit up in the ED, ambulatory at any time, delayed onset of neck pain, and absence of midline cervical tenderness. 

According to the guidelines, patients who meet the low-risk criteria should undergo range-of-motion testing. If the patient is able to actively rotate their neck 45 degrees to the left and right, imaging is not necessary. Therefore, cervical immobilization is the most appropriate next step in this case. 

Lateral cervical film (option A) and three view cervical spine series (option B) are imaging modalities that may be considered if the patient does not meet the low-risk criteria or is unable to actively rotate their neck. However, in this case, imaging is not necessary as the patient meets the low-risk criteria and is able to actively rotate their neck. 

IV methylprednisolone (option D) is not indicated in the initial management of cervical spine injuries. It may be considered in certain cases of spinal cord injury, but there is no indication for its use in this scenario. 

Observation overnight (option E) may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. Cervical immobilization is the initial step in the evaluation and management of cervical spine injuries.",
"A 43-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia, currently controlled with medication, comes in for an appointment with his internist. He is concerned about abnormal discharge from both nipples over the past 3 months. The fluid is white, and he wonders if it could be milk. On further review of systems, he endorses a diminished sexual drive. The physician suspects that one of the patient's medications may be the culprit for these symptoms. Which of the following medications is NOT likely to be the cause?
Options:
(A): Metoclopramide
(B): Haloperidol
(C): Bromocriptine
(D): Fluphenazine
(E): Risperidone
",Bromocriptine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Bromocriptine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of abnormal nipple discharge and diminished sexual drive are suggestive of hyperprolactinemia, which is an adverse effect of certain medications used to treat schizophrenia. These medications, known as antipsychotics, can increase prolactin levels in the body, leading to these symptoms.

Metoclopramide (A), Fluphenazine (D), and Risperidone (E) are all antipsychotic medications that have been associated with hyperprolactinemia. Haloperidol (B) is also an antipsychotic medication, but it is less likely to cause hyperprolactinemia compared to the other options.

Bromocriptine (C), on the other hand, is a dopamine agonist that is used to treat hyperprolactinemia. It works by inhibiting the release of prolactin from the pituitary gland. Therefore, it is not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.",
"A 2-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because of yellowing of the skin and sclerae for 16 hours. He had previously been well. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation via uncomplicated vaginal delivery and weighed 3.1 kg (6 lb 13 oz). The mother has no medical insurance and did not receive prenatal care. The newborn's 4-year-old brother has sickle cell disease. Examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is mildly distended. The liver is palpated 1 cm below the right costal margin and the spleen tip is palpated just below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Reticulocytes 9%
Leukocytes 9,100/mm3
Platelets 244,000/mm3
Maternal blood group 0, Rh-negative
Anti-Rh antibody titer positive
Fetal blood group B, Rh-negative
Serum
Bilirubin, total 11.3 mg/dL
Direct 0.3 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""
Options:
(A): RBC enzyme deficiency
(B): RBC sickling
(C): Anti-D antibodies
(D): Biliary duct malformation
(E): Anti-B antibodies
",Anti-B antibodies,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Anti-B antibodies.

Explanation:
This patient's condition is most likely due to ABO incompatibility between the mother and the newborn. The mother has blood group O and the newborn has blood group B. The presence of anti-B antibodies in the mother's serum can cause hemolysis of the newborn's red blood cells, leading to an increase in bilirubin levels and subsequent jaundice. The laboratory findings of a mildly elevated total bilirubin level and a normal direct bilirubin level are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of jaundice, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly further support the diagnosis of ABO incompatibility. The absence of a history of viral infection, RBC enzyme deficiency, or RBC sickling, as well as the absence of biliary duct malformation, makes these options less likely. Anti-D antibodies would be relevant if the mother were Rh-negative and the newborn were Rh-positive, but this is not the case in this patient.",
"A 65-year old man presents with gradually worsening rigidity of his arms and legs and slowness in performing tasks. He says he has also noticed hand tremors, which increase at rest and decrease with focused movements. On examination, the patient does not swing his arms while walking and has a shortened, shuffling gait. An antiviral drug is prescribed which alleviates the patient’s symptoms. Which of the following drugs was most likely prescribed to this patient?
Options:
(A): Amantadine
(B): Ribavirin
(C): Acyclovir
(D): Levodopa
(E): Zidovudine
",Amantadine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Amantadine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of gradually worsening rigidity, slowness in performing tasks, hand tremors that increase at rest and decrease with focused movements, and the presence of a shortened, shuffling gait, the most likely diagnosis is Parkinson's disease. 

Amantadine is an antiviral drug that has been found to have beneficial effects in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is thought to work by increasing the release of dopamine in the brain and blocking the reuptake of dopamine. This helps to alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including rigidity, slowness of movement, and tremors.

Ribavirin, Acyclovir, and Zidovudine are antiviral drugs used to treat viral infections such as hepatitis C, herpes, and HIV, respectively. These drugs are not indicated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Levodopa is a medication commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, in this case, the patient has already been prescribed an antiviral drug, suggesting that Amantadine was the most likely choice.",
"The patient is given prophylactic labetalol and magnesium sulfate. Examination shows absent deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Stop magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate
(B): Stop labetalol
(C): Stop magnesium sulfate and give lorazepam
(D): Perform nerve conduction studies
(E): Perform emergency cesarean section
",Stop magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Stop magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate.

Explanation:
The patient is showing signs of absent deep tendon reflexes, which can be indicative of hypocalcemia. Magnesium sulfate can cause hypocalcemia as a side effect. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to stop the administration of magnesium sulfate and give calcium gluconate.

Calcium gluconate is a calcium preparation that can help restore normal calcium levels and alleviate the symptoms of hypocalcemia. It is important to address the hypocalcemia promptly as it can lead to complications such as seizures and arrhythmias.

Stopping labetalol or giving lorazepam would not address the underlying issue of hypocalcemia. Performing nerve conduction studies may be helpful in diagnosing the cause of absent deep tendon reflexes, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Emergency cesarean section would not be indicated based solely on absent deep tendon reflexes. Increasing the magnesium sulfate dose would exacerbate the hypocalcemia and should be avoided.",
"A 75-year-old woman is brought by a patrolman to the emergency department because of altered mental status. She was found wandering next to the highway. The patient was unable to answer questions and collapsed in transit. Her vitals are: temperature, 33.0°C (91.4°F); pulse, 40/min; respirations,12/min; blood pressure, 80/50 mm Hg; and oxygen saturation, 85% on room air. Physical examination shows decorticate posturing, incomprehensible speech, eyes opening to pain, dry hair, coarse and waxy skin, and non-pitting edema around the face and all extremities. Electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia. Laboratory studies show:
Calcium 9.0 mg/dL
Hematocrit (female) 34%
Potassium 4.0 mEq/L
Sodium 120 mEq/L
TSH 110.0 µU/mL
Thyroxine (T4) 1.2 µg/dL
Triiodothyronine (T3) 70 ng/dL
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Myxedema coma
(B): Pheochromocytoma crisis
(C): Septic shock
(D): Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
(E): Thyroid storm
",Myxedema coma,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Myxedema coma.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with myxedema coma, which is a severe form of hypothyroidism. The patient has altered mental status, bradycardia, hypotension, and hypothermia, all of which are characteristic findings in myxedema coma. The patient also has dry hair, coarse and waxy skin, and non-pitting edema, which are typical manifestations of severe hypothyroidism. The laboratory findings of low T4 and T3 levels and elevated TSH further support the diagnosis of myxedema coma. Pheochromocytoma crisis, septic shock, and tertiary hyperparathyroidism are not consistent with the patient's presentation and laboratory findings. Thyroid storm is a severe form of hyperthyroidism and would present with hyperthermia, tachycardia, and hypertension, which are not seen in this patient.",
"A 66-year-old male presents to his primary care physician to discuss his increasing shortness of breathover the last 3 months. He notes that this is particularly obvious when he is mowing his lawn or climbing the stairs in his home. His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is well-controlled with lisinopril. His vital signs are as follows: T 37.6 C, HR 88, BP 136/58, RR 18, SpO2 97% RA. Physical examination is significant for an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, a midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border, and a late diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex on auscultation. In addition, an S3 heart sound is also present. Bounding pulses are palpated at the radial arteries bilaterally. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?
Options:
(A): Mitral regurgitation
(B): Mitral stenosis
(C): Aortic regurgitation
(D): Aortic stenosis
(E): Mitral prolapse
",Aortic regurgitation,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Aortic regurgitation.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of increasing shortness of breath with exertion, along with the presence of bounding pulses, an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, and an S3 heart sound, the most likely diagnosis is aortic regurgitation.

Aortic regurgitation is characterized by the backflow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. This results in an increased volume load on the left ventricle, leading to left ventricular dilation and hypertrophy. The increased volume load can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, especially with exertion.

The physical examination findings of an early diastolic blowing, decrescendo murmur heard best at the left sternal border, and a bounding pulse are consistent with aortic regurgitation. The midsystolic murmur heard best at the right upper sternal border is likely due to associated aortic stenosis, which can often coexist with aortic regurgitation.

Mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis, and mitral prolapse are less likely in this patient based on the physical examination findings. Mitral regurgitation is characterized by a holosystolic murmur heard best at the apex, while mitral stenosis is characterized by a diastolic rumbling murmur heard best at the apex. Mitral prolapse is characterized by a mid-systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur. None of these findings are present in this patient.",
"A 28-year-old woman presents following a suicide attempt 2 days ago. She says that her attempt was a result of a fight with her boyfriend and that she slit her wrists in an attempt to keep him from breaking up with her. In the past, she has had many turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life. Her family members describe her as being very impulsive and frequently acting to manipulate people’s feelings. Since she was admitted to the hospital, she has spit at several staff members and alternated between sobbing and anger. She has no significant past medical history. The patient denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Histrionic personality disorder
(B): Borderline personality disorder
(C): Dependent personality disorder
(D): Avoidant personality disorder
(E): Narcissistic personality disorder
",Borderline personality disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Borderline personality disorder.

Explanation:
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, as well as marked impulsivity. The patient in this scenario exhibits several key features of BPD. She has a history of turbulent relationships, both romantic and in her family life, which is consistent with the unstable interpersonal relationships seen in BPD. Her impulsive behavior, such as slitting her wrists in an attempt to manipulate her boyfriend, is also characteristic of BPD. Additionally, her alternating between sobbing and anger, as well as spitting at staff members, demonstrates the marked affective instability seen in BPD. 

Histrionic personality disorder (A) is characterized by excessive emotionality and attention-seeking behavior, but does not typically involve self-harm or impulsivity to manipulate others.

Dependent personality disorder (C) is characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, but does not typically involve self-harm or impulsivity to manipulate others.

Avoidant personality disorder (D) is characterized by social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation, but does not typically involve self-harm or impulsivity to manipulate others.

Narcissistic personality disorder (E) is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy, but does not typically involve self-harm or impulsivity to manipulate others.",
"A 50-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor following an inguinal hernia repair. The patient reports no pain in his lower abdomen or groin, no constipation, and states that he enjoys his usual diet. He denies any use of alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs. He has returned to work as a cruise ship attendant. Preoperative workup included chest radiography which demonstrated an opacification in his right middle lobe. The patient agrees to undergo computed tomography (CT) of his chest without contrast for further evaluation. The radiologist reports an 8 mm nodule in the patient's peripheral right middle lobe that has regular margins and appears calcified. One year later, the patient obtains another chest CT without contrast that reports the nodule size as 10 mm with similar characteristics. What is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): CT chest without contrast in 12 months
(B): CT chest without contrast in 24 months
(C): Positive emission tomography (PET) of chest now
(D): Right middle lobectomy now
(E): Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now
",Positive emission tomography (PET) of chest now,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Positive emission tomography (PET) of chest now.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a persistent nodule in the right middle lobe of the lung that has increased in size from 8 mm to 10 mm over the course of one year. The nodule has regular margins and appears calcified, which suggests a benign etiology. However, given the increase in size, further evaluation is warranted to rule out malignancy.

A CT chest without contrast in 12 or 24 months (options A and B) would not be the most appropriate next step in management because the nodule has already increased in size over the course of one year. Waiting another 12 or 24 months for repeat imaging could delay the diagnosis of a potentially malignant nodule.

Right middle lobectomy now (option D) would be an aggressive approach for a nodule that appears benign and has not demonstrated any concerning features. Lobectomy is typically reserved for nodules that are highly suspicious for malignancy or have been confirmed to be malignant.

Bronchoscopy-guided biopsy now (option E) may be considered if there are other concerning features of the nodule or if the patient has symptoms suggestive of lung cancer. However, in this case, the nodule has regular margins and appears calcified, which suggests a benign etiology. Therefore, a less invasive approach should be considered first.

Positive emission tomography (PET) of the chest now (option C) is the most appropriate next step in management. PET can help differentiate between benign and malignant nodules by assessing the metabolic activity of the nodule. A benign nodule is less likely to show increased metabolic activity on PET, while a malignant nodule is more likely to demonstrate increased uptake of the radiotracer. PET can provide valuable information to guide further management decisions, such as the need for biopsy or surgical resection.",
"A 29-year-old man comes in for evaluation of infertility. He has been trying to conceive for over 2 years with his wife and previous evaluation of his wife's fertility revealed no abnormalities. Physical exam reveals a tall man with long extremities, sparse body hair, gynecomastia, and small testes. Laboratory studies reveal increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. Genetic studies reveal a cytogenetic abnormality. If this abnormality was inherited from the patient's father, at which stage of spermatogenesis did this error most likely occur?
Options:
(A): Primary spermatocyte
(B): Secondary spermatocyte
(C): Spermatid
(D): Spermatogonium
(E): Spermatozoon
",Primary spermatocyte,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Primary spermatocyte.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Klinefelter syndrome, which is characterized by an extra X chromosome (XXY). In Klinefelter syndrome, there is impaired spermatogenesis and infertility. The physical exam findings of gynecomastia, small testes, and sparse body hair are characteristic of this condition.

In Klinefelter syndrome, there is an increased serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration and an increased estradiol:testosterone ratio. The increased FSH levels indicate abnormal spermatogenesis. The error in spermatogenesis in Klinefelter syndrome most likely occurs at the stage of primary spermatocyte.

During spermatogenesis, each germinal cell (spermatogonium) undergoes differentiation into primary spermatocytes, which then undergo meiosis to form secondary spermatocytes. Therefore, if the cytogenetic abnormality in Klinefelter syndrome is inherited from the patient's father, it most likely occurred at the stage of primary spermatocyte.

It is important to note that Klinefelter syndrome is a common cause of male infertility, and genetic testing should be considered in men with azoospermia or severe oligospermia.",
"A 13-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with severe knee, hip, and groin pain. The patient has a past medical history notable only for obesity and asthma. His temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 124/65 mmHg, pulse is 128/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an inability of the patient to bear weight on his left leg and limited range of motion of the left hip. Which of the following is the best management for this patient?
Options:
(A): Casting and crutches
(B): Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness
(C): Supportive therapy and observation
(D): Surgical drainage of the hip
(E): Surgical pinning of the femoral head
",Surgical pinning of the femoral head,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Surgical pinning of the femoral head.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of severe knee, hip, and groin pain, inability to bear weight on the left leg, and limited range of motion of the left hip, the most likely diagnosis is Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. This is a condition that affects the blood supply to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis and subsequent collapse of the femoral head.

The best management for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is surgical pinning of the femoral head. This procedure aims to stabilize the femoral head and prevent further collapse, allowing for proper healing and preservation of the hip joint. Surgical pinning is typically recommended for patients who are younger and have a good chance of maintaining hip joint function.

Casting and crutches (option A) may be used in the initial stages of treatment to provide support and pain relief, but they are not the definitive management for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.

Immobilization of the hip in a Pavlik harness (option B) is typically used for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip in infants, not for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.

Supportive therapy and observation (option C) may be considered in some cases, but given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for long-term complications, surgical intervention is the preferred management.

Surgical drainage of the hip (option D) is not indicated in the management of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.

Therefore, the best management for this patient is surgical pinning of the femoral head (option E).",
"A 28-year-old man comes to the physician because of diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain for 5 weeks. He has had up to 4 bowel movements per day. Several times he noticed mucoid strings with the stool. He has abdominal bloating. Over the past month, has had a 3.2-kg (7-lb) weight loss. He has not had fever, cough, or bloody stools. He had a painful rash on his lower extremity 3 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. He works as a pharmacy technician. His temperature is 37.3°C (98.8°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 115/77 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 11.9 g/dL, MCV is 79 fL, ferritin is 106 ng/dL, and platelet count is 410,000/mm3; serum concentrations of glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes are within the reference range. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Mucosal lactase deficiency
(B): Increased serum VIP
(C): Stool leukocytes
(D): Melanosis coli
(E): Normal intestinal mucosa
",Stool leukocytes,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Stool leukocytes.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms of chronic diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, weight loss, and mucoid strings in the stool are suggestive of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The presence of stool leukocytes further supports this diagnosis. Stool leukocytes are an indicator of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and are commonly seen in patients with IBD, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Other findings in this patient, such as the history of a painful rash on the lower extremity (which may be erythema nodosum, a common skin manifestation of IBD) and the occupation as a pharmacy technician (which may expose him to potential triggers of IBD), also support the diagnosis of IBD. Mucosal lactase deficiency (choice A) is unlikely in this patient because it typically presents with symptoms of lactose intolerance, such as bloating and diarrhea, shortly after consuming dairy products. Increased serum vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (choice B) is associated with VIPoma, a rare neuroendocrine tumor that can cause watery diarrhea. However, this patient's symptoms are more consistent with IBD. Melanosis coli (choice D) is a benign condition characterized by dark pigmentation of the colonic mucosa due to chronic laxative use. This patient's symptoms are not consistent with melanosis coli. Normal intestinal mucosa (choice E) is unlikely in this patient given the presence of symptoms and stool leukocytes suggestive of inflammation.",
"A 51-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, abdominal pain, and confusion. His wife states that he has been unable to recall his birthday or her name. He was diagnosed with hepatitis C 3 years ago but refused treatment. He has been treated twice in the past year for acute pancreatitis. There is no family history of serious illness. His only medication is a calcium supplement. He emigrated from India 15 years ago. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 104/68 mm Hg. He is confused and oriented only to person. Examination shows scleral icterus and spider angiomas. There are fine tremors of the hands bilaterally. The abdomen is distended and shifting dullness is present. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding. Bowel sounds are absent. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL
Leukocyte count 13,900/mm3
Platelet count 342,000/mm3
Serum
Albumin 2.6 g/dL
Total bilirubin 2.56 mg/dL

Paracentesis is performed. Ascitic fluid analysis shows an albumin concentration of 0.8 g/dL, glucose concentration of 62 mg/dL, and a leukocyte count of 1900/mm3 with 60% neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
Options:
(A): Pancreatic fluid leakage
(B): Aseptic peritoneal inflammation
(C): Neoplastic growth
(D): Bacterial translocation
(E): Perforated viscus
",Bacterial translocation,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Bacterial translocation.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), which is an infection of the ascitic fluid without an evident intra-abdominal source. SBP is most commonly caused by bacterial translocation from the gut. In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, there is increased intestinal permeability, allowing bacteria from the gut to translocate into the peritoneal cavity. The ascitic fluid analysis in this patient shows a low albumin concentration (0.8 g/dL), which is indicative of ascitic fluid leakage from the peritoneal cavity. The glucose concentration is decreased (62 mg/dL), which is consistent with bacterial consumption of glucose. The leukocyte count is elevated (1900/mm3) with a predominance of neutrophils (60%), indicating an inflammatory response to infection. The patient's history of hepatitis C, acute pancreatitis, and emigration from India are not directly related to the findings in this case. Pancreatic fluid leakage, neoplastic growth, and perforated viscus would typically present with different clinical features and laboratory findings.",
"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department because of a cough that her parents are worried about. She has had a runny nose and a low-grade fever for the past 2 days, with some hoarseness and a rough-sounding cough that started this afternoon. This evening she began making some high-pitched sounds when taking breaths, and she seemed to be having some trouble breathing. She is alert and does not appear to be in acute distress. She has a temperature of 38.0°C (100.4 °F), with a respiratory rate of 50/min and O2 saturation of 97%. There is audible inspiratory stridor that worsens when she starts to cry during the examination. She has an occasional barking cough. Her pharynx is mildly erythematous with normal tonsils and no exudate. A frontal X-ray of the upper chest airways is obtained (shown in the image). Which of the following is the best step in management?
Options:
(A): Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck
(B): Intubation
(C): Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy
(D): Intravenous antibiotics
(E): Trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids
",Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and the image provided, the most likely diagnosis is croup. Croup is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway, leading to symptoms such as a barking cough, hoarseness, and inspiratory stridor. The X-ray image shows a characteristic ""steeple sign,"" which is indicative of subglottic narrowing.

The management of croup involves providing supportive care and reducing airway inflammation. Racemic epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor that can help reduce airway swelling and improve breathing. Intramuscular corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, are effective in reducing airway inflammation and improving symptoms. Therefore, the best step in management for this patient would be to administer racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy.

Anterior-posterior and lateral radiographs of the neck (option A) may be obtained in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or if there is concern for other causes of upper airway obstruction, such as epiglottitis or foreign body aspiration. However, in this case, the clinical presentation and X-ray findings are consistent with croup, making this option less necessary.

Intubation (option B) is not indicated in this patient as she is alert, not in acute distress, and her oxygen saturation is normal. Intubation is reserved for cases of severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure.

Intravenous antibiotics (option D) are not indicated in this case as croup is typically caused by a viral infection. Antibiotics are only necessary if there is concern for a bacterial infection, such as epiglottitis or bacterial tracheitis, which is not supported by the clinical presentation.

A trial of bronchodilator therapy and oral steroids (option E) may be considered in cases of wheezing or suspected underlying asthma, but it is not the best initial step in management for croup. In this case, the patient's symptoms and X-ray findings are consistent with croup, making racemic epinephrine and intramuscular corticosteroid therapy the more appropriate choice.",
"A 43-year-old woman presents with complaints of retrosternal burning associated with eating. It has persisted for the past several years but has been getting worse. Her past medical history is unknown and this is her first time seeing a doctor. She states she is otherwise healthy and review of systems is notable for episodic hand pain that is worse in the winter as well as a chronic and severe cough with dyspnea which she attributes to her smoking. Her temperature is 97.7°F (36.5°C), blood pressure is 174/104 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a young appearing woman with coarse breath sounds. Laboratory studies and urinalysis are ordered and currently pending. Which of the following is the pathophysiology of this patient's chief complaint?
Options:
(A): Decreased lower esophageal tone
(B): Esophageal fibrosis
(C): Increased lower esophageal tone
(D): Spastic cricopharyngeal muscle
(E): Uncoordinated esophageal peristalsis
",Esophageal fibrosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Esophageal fibrosis.

Explanation:
The patient's chief complaint of retrosternal burning associated with eating is suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Esophageal fibrosis is a complication of long-standing GERD. Chronic exposure of the esophagus to gastric acid can lead to inflammation and scarring of the esophageal tissue, resulting in fibrosis. This fibrosis can cause narrowing of the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and retrosternal burning.

The patient's history of persistent symptoms for several years that have been getting worse, along with the physical exam findings of coarse breath sounds, suggest chronic inflammation and scarring of the esophagus. The presence of other symptoms such as episodic hand pain and chronic cough with dyspnea may be unrelated to the patient's chief complaint and could be indicative of other underlying conditions.

Decreased lower esophageal tone (option A) is not the correct answer because it would result in gastroesophageal reflux, but it would not explain the development of esophageal fibrosis.

Increased lower esophageal tone (option C) is not the correct answer because it would result in difficulty swallowing and dysphagia, but it would not explain the development of esophageal fibrosis.

Spastic cricopharyngeal muscle (option D) is not the correct answer because it refers to a condition called cricopharyngeal spasm, which is characterized by difficulty swallowing and a sensation of a lump in the throat. It is not directly related to the development of esophageal fibrosis.

Uncoordinated esophageal peristalsis (option E) is not the correct answer because it refers to a condition called esophageal dysmotility, which can cause symptoms such as dysphagia and chest pain, but it is not directly related to the development of esophageal fibrosis.",
"A 67-year-old man with chronic kidney disease comes to the physician because of worsening fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion for 6 months. He has a 20-year history of poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include metformin and insulin. His pulse is 105/min. Examination shows conjunctival pallor and bounding pulses. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8.6 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 90 μm3
Reticulocyte count 0.5%
Serum
Ferritin 325 ng/mL
Urea nitrogen 45 mg/dL
Creatinine 2.2 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a drug to treat the cause of his current symptoms. The drug's mechanism of action directly involves which of the following signaling pathways?""
Options:
(A): PI3K/Akt/mTOR
(B): cAMP
(C): MAP kinase
(D): JAK/STAT
(E): IP3
",JAK/STAT,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): JAK/STAT.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion, along with the laboratory findings of low hemoglobin and high reticulocyte count, are consistent with anemia. The conjunctival pallor and bounding pulses suggest a high-output state, which can be seen in conditions such as anemia. 

The laboratory findings also show an elevated serum ferritin level, which is indicative of iron overload. This can occur in chronic kidney disease due to decreased renal excretion of iron. 

The drug prescribed to treat the cause of the patient's symptoms is likely erythropoietin (EPO). EPO is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. It acts through the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. 

EPO binds to its receptor on erythroid progenitor cells, activating the JAK (Janus kinase) family of enzymes. This leads to the phosphorylation and activation of STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins. The activated STAT proteins then translocate to the nucleus and regulate the transcription of genes involved in erythropoiesis, ultimately increasing red blood cell production. 

Therefore, the drug's mechanism of action directly involves the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.",
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a 6-hour history of muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. He says that these symptoms came on rapidly but does not recall anything that may have triggered the episode. He has never experienced these symptoms before. His past medical history is significant for obesity, sleep apnea, and type 2 diabetes that is well controlled on metformin. He also has gastroesophageal reflux disease for which he occasionally takes antacids. On presentation he is found to have fast, shallow breathing and abdominal pain that is poorly localized. Basic labs as well as an arterial blood gas are obtained and the results are shown below:

Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 106 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
pH: 7.25
pCO2: 22 mmHg

Which of the following is the most likely cause of the changes seen in this patient's labs?
Options:
(A): Antacids
(B): Anxiety
(C): Diarrhea
(D): Metformin
(E): Sleep apnea
",Metformin,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Metformin.

Explanation:
The patient's labs show a low bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 11 mEq/L and a low pH of 7.25, indicating metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis can be caused by various factors, including diarrhea, but in this case, the most likely cause is metformin.

Metformin is an oral medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. However, one of the potential side effects of metformin is lactic acidosis, which can occur when there is an accumulation of lactic acid in the body. Lactic acidosis can lead to symptoms such as muscle cramping, decreased appetite, and abdominal pain.

In this patient, the rapid onset of symptoms, along with the presence of metabolic acidosis and the use of metformin, strongly suggest that metformin is the cause of the changes seen in the labs. It is important to recognize this potential side effect of metformin and promptly discontinue the medication in patients presenting with symptoms of lactic acidosis.",
"A scientist is studying the properties of myosin-actin interactions in a sample of human muscle tissue. She has identified a drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head. If she gives this drug to a sample of human muscle tissue under physiologic conditions, which of the following steps in cross-bridge cycling will most likely be blocked?
Options:
(A): Myosin head release from actin
(B): Myosin head cocking
(C): Exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin
(D): Myosin head binding to actin
(E): Power stroke
",Power stroke,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Power stroke.

Explanation:
In cross-bridge cycling, the power stroke is the step where the myosin head pivots and produces force to pull on the actin filament. This step is accompanied by the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the myosin head. The drug that selectively inhibits phosphate release by the myosin head would block the power stroke, as it prevents the release of Pi. Without the power stroke, the myosin head would not be able to generate force and pull on the actin filament, leading to a disruption in muscle contraction. Therefore, the most likely step to be blocked by this drug is the power stroke.",
"A 16-year-old boy with a seizure disorder and cognitive delay is brought to the physician because of progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness for the past 6 months. He does not make eye contact and sits very close to his mother. Physical examination shows a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex. Neurological examination shows decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities. Fundoscopic examination shows several multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina bilaterally. A photograph of his skin findings is shown. This patient's condition is most likely due to a mutation in which of the following?
Options:
(A): NF1 gene on chromosome 17
(B): NF2 gene on chromosome 22
(C): GNAQ gene on chromosome 9
(D): TSC1 gene on chromosome 9
(E): VHL gene on chromosome 3
",TSC1 gene on chromosome 9,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, this patient most likely has tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is caused by mutations in either the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9 or the TSC2 gene on chromosome 16. TSC is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of benign tumors in multiple organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and skin. 

The patient's seizure disorder and cognitive delay are consistent with the neurological manifestations of TSC. The progressively worsening right lower extremity weakness may be due to the presence of a tumor or hamartoma in the brain or spinal cord, which can cause compression of neural structures. The decreased strength in the right lower leg with normal strength in the other extremities further supports this possibility.

The presence of a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the cardiac apex suggests the presence of a cardiac rhabdomyoma, which is a common cardiac manifestation of TSC. The multinodular, calcified lesions in the retina seen on fundoscopic examination are characteristic of retinal hamartomas, another common feature of TSC.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is a mutation in the TSC1 gene on chromosome 9.",
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. He endorses diffuse abdominal tenderness. His past medical history is notable for diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, dyslipidemia, depression, and morbid obesity. He also is currently being treated for an outbreak of genital herpes. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/102 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an obese man in no acute distress. A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast is performed and is unremarkable. The patient is admitted to the observation unit for monitoring of his pain. Notably, the patient's abdominal pain improves after an enema and multiple bowel movements. The patient's evening laboratory values are ordered and return as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 99 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 11 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 177 mg/dL
Creatinine: 3.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient's laboratory derangements?
Options:
(A): Acyclovir
(B): Atorvastatin
(C): Insulin
(D): Metformin
(E): Metoprolol
",Metformin,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Metformin.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory derangements, specifically the low bicarbonate (HCO3-) level of 11 mEq/L, suggest the presence of metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis can be caused by various factors, including medications. In this case, the most likely cause of the metabolic acidosis is metformin.

Metformin is an oral antidiabetic medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity. However, one of the potential side effects of metformin is lactic acidosis, which can occur in patients with impaired renal function. The patient in this case has a history of diabetic nephropathy, which suggests underlying renal impairment. The elevated creatinine level of 3.1 mg/dL further supports this.

Lactic acidosis is a serious condition characterized by the buildup of lactic acid in the body. It can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. The low bicarbonate level is a compensatory response to the metabolic acidosis.

It is important to note that metformin-associated lactic acidosis is rare, but it can be life-threatening. In this case, the patient's abdominal pain improved after an enema and multiple bowel movements, which suggests that the lactic acidosis may have been caused by metformin-induced bowel ischemia. This can occur due to reduced blood flow to the intestines, leading to lactic acid buildup.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation, laboratory values, and medical history, metformin is the most likely etiology of the laboratory derangements. It is important to discontinue metformin and provide supportive care to manage the lactic acidosis.",
"A 56-year-old man comes to the clinic for a check-up. He presents with a 1-year history of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss. He is a former construction worker, and worked in a steel mill when he was in high school. He is an active smoker with a 36-pack-year smoking history. The blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg, pulse rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, and the BMI is 31 kg/m2. The patient is afebrile and the oxygen saturation at rest is 95% on room air. The pulmonary examination reveals a mildly prolonged expiratory phase, and no wheezing or crackles are auscultated. A pulmonary function test is recommended for the patient, and 2 weeks later he returns with a report that shows an FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value. The lung volumes show a total lung capacity of 110% of predicted value, a residual volume of 115% of predicted value, and a DLCO of 60% of predicted value. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Asbestosis
(B): Obesity hypoventilation syndrome
(C): Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis
(D): Bronchiectasis
(E): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Explanation:
The patient's history of smoking, along with the symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and weight loss, are highly suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive lung disease that is commonly caused by smoking and is characterized by airflow limitation. The pulmonary function test results support this diagnosis. The FEV1/FVC ratio of 60% and FEV1 of 50% of the predicted value indicate airflow limitation, which is a hallmark of COPD. The lung volumes also show increased total lung capacity and residual volume, which are consistent with COPD. The DLCO of 60% of predicted value indicates impaired gas exchange, which is another characteristic feature of COPD. Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and pulmonary function test results, the most likely diagnosis is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
"A 25-year-old zookeeper presents to the office complaining of a dry cough, fever, and chills for the past month. He states that the symptoms come in episodes at the end of the workday and last a few hours. He also mentions that he is fatigued all the time. His job includes taking care of various types of birds. He is otherwise fine and denies recent travel or trauma. Medical history is unremarkable and he does not take any medications. He does not smoke cigarettes or drinks alcohol. Allergies include peanuts, dust, and pollen. Childhood asthma runs in the family. Chest X-ray reveals diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields. A PPD skin test is negative. What is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Thoracocentesis
(B): Inhaled beclomethasone
(C): Avoid exposure to birds
(D): Isoniazid for 6 months
(E): Reassurance
",Avoid exposure to birds,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Avoid exposure to birds.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of dry cough, fever, and chills, along with the episodes occurring at the end of the workday and lasting a few hours, it is likely that the patient is experiencing symptoms of bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). HP is an immune-mediated lung disease that occurs in individuals who are sensitized to specific antigens found in bird droppings, feathers, or other bird-related materials. The symptoms typically occur after exposure to the antigen and can include cough, fever, chills, fatigue, and shortness of breath.

The patient's occupation as a zookeeper, where he is exposed to various types of birds, further supports the diagnosis of bird-related HP. The chest X-ray findings of diffuse haziness in both lower lung fields are consistent with the disease.

The most appropriate treatment for bird-related HP is to avoid exposure to the bird antigens. This involves removing the patient from the environment where the exposure occurs, in this case, avoiding contact with birds. This is the most effective way to prevent further episodes and manage the symptoms.

Thoracocentesis (A) is a procedure to remove fluid or air from the pleural space and is not indicated in this case. Inhaled beclomethasone (B) is a corticosteroid used to treat asthma and other respiratory conditions, but it is not the appropriate treatment for bird-related HP. Isoniazid for 6 months (D) is a medication used to treat tuberculosis and is not indicated in this case. Reassurance (E) may be provided to the patient, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for bird-related HP.",
"A 60-year-old female presents to her gynecologist with vaginal bleeding. She underwent menopause ten years prior. She has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. On physical examination, her uterus is uniformly enlarged. Ultrasound reveals a thickened endometrial stripe and tissue biopsy reveals neoplastic endometrial cells. A workup for metastatic disease is negative and the gynecologist recommends a laparoscopic hysterectomy. During the procedure, the surgeon ligates multiple vessels in order to remove the entire uterus. In the immediate postoperative period, the patient develops left-sided flank pain and oliguria. Serum creatinine is found to be 1.4 mg/dl whereas it was 1.0 mg/dl prior to the operation. Renal ultrasound is normal. Urinalysis is notable for hematuria. Ligation of which of the following vessels most likely contributed to this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Artery of Sampson
(B): Ovarian artery
(C): Superior vesical artery
(D): Uterine artery
(E): Inferior vesical artery
",Uterine artery,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Uterine artery.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario developed left-sided flank pain and oliguria in the immediate postoperative period after a laparoscopic hysterectomy. These symptoms, along with the finding of hematuria on urinalysis, suggest the possibility of a urinary tract injury. The most likely vessel that was ligated during the procedure and contributed to this patient's condition is the uterine artery.

The uterine artery is a branch of the internal iliac artery and supplies blood to the uterus. During a hysterectomy, the uterine artery is often ligated to remove the entire uterus. However, if the uterine artery is inadvertently ligated too close to its origin, it can result in injury to nearby structures, such as the ureter.

In this case, the left-sided flank pain and oliguria suggest a possible injury to the left ureter, which runs adjacent to the uterine artery. The hematuria further supports the possibility of a urinary tract injury. Renal ultrasound being normal does not rule out a ureteral injury, as it may not be able to detect subtle injuries.

Therefore, ligation of the uterine artery most likely contributed to this patient's condition of left-sided flank pain, oliguria, and hematuria. Further evaluation, such as a retrograde pyelogram or CT urogram, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the injury.",
"A 40-year-old man presents to the physician with progressive weight loss for the last 3 months. He also says he frequently sweats profusely at night and has a recurring low-grade fever, for which he takes acetaminophen. The patient denies any symptoms like cough, breathlessness, or gastrointestinal symptoms. His temperature is 37.1ºC  (98.8ºF), pulse is 76/min, blood pressure is 116/78 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 13/min. On physical examination, he has generalized pallor. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is present. Examination of his abdomen reveals non-tender hepatosplenomegaly in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory evaluation confirms the diagnosis of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Which of the following viral infections is most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient’s malignancy?
Options:
(A): Cytomegalovirus
(B): Epstein-Barr virus
(C): Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1
(D): Human herpesvirus-8
(E): Human papillomavirus type 16
",Epstein-Barr virus,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Epstein-Barr virus.

Explanation:
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is most likely to have played a role in the pathogenesis of this patient's Hodgkin's lymphoma. EBV is a known risk factor for the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma, particularly the nodular sclerosis subtype. EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and is associated with various malignancies, including Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin's lymphoma.

The patient's symptoms of weight loss, night sweats, and fever are consistent with B symptoms, which are often seen in Hodgkin's lymphoma. The presence of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly further supports the diagnosis of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

While other viral infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), and human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16), have been associated with certain malignancies, they are not commonly associated with the development of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely viral infection involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's malignancy is Epstein-Barr virus.",
"A 28-year-old gravida 1 at 32 weeks gestation is evaluated for an abnormal ultrasound that showed fetal microcephaly. Early in the 1st trimester, she had fevers and headaches for 1 week. She also experienced myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash. The symptoms resolved without any medications. A week prior to her symptoms, she had traveled to Brazil where she spent most of the evenings hiking. She did not use any mosquito repellents. There is no personal or family history of chronic or congenital diseases. Medications include iron supplementation and a multivitamin. She received all of the recommended childhood vaccinations. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis were negative. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic agent?
Options:
(A): Dengue virus
(B): Bartonella henselae
(C): Rubella virus
(D): Toxoplasmosis
(E): Zika virus
",Zika virus,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Zika virus.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fevers, headaches, myalgias, arthralgias, and a pruritic maculopapular rash, are consistent with a viral infection. Given her travel history to Brazil, where she did not use mosquito repellents, and the presence of fetal microcephaly on ultrasound, the most likely etiologic agent is Zika virus.

Zika virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected Aedes mosquitoes. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact and from mother to fetus during pregnancy. Infection during pregnancy can lead to severe birth defects, including microcephaly.

The absence of IgM and IgG titers for toxoplasmosis rules out toxoplasmosis as the etiologic agent. Dengue virus, Bartonella henselae, and Rubella virus do not typically cause microcephaly and are not associated with the patient's travel history. Therefore, Zika virus is the most likely etiologic agent in this case.",
"A 41-year-old G3P1 woman presents with a sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness. Patient has no significant past medical history and takes no medications.  Her last two pregnancies ended with spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation. No significant family history. Her vital signs include: blood pressure 130/90 mm Hg, pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.8℃ (98.2℉). GCS is 14/15. Physical examination shows 3+ deep tendon reflexes and increased muscle tone in the left upper and lower extremities. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Platelet count 230,000/mm3
Fibrinogen 3.5 g/L
Activated partial thromboplastin time  70 s
Thrombin time 34 s
 A non-contrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the picture. Which of the following would be the next best diagnostic step in this patient?
Options:
(A): Mixing study
(B): INR
(C): D-dimer
(D): Ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation test
(E): Clot retraction study
",Mixing study,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Mixing study.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with sudden onset throbbing headache, tinnitus, nausea, and left-sided weakness, along with the laboratory findings of prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and thrombin time, suggests a possible coagulation disorder. The next best diagnostic step in this patient would be a mixing study.

A mixing study is used to differentiate between factor deficiency and factor inhibitor as the cause of a prolonged aPTT. In this test, the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma in a 1:1 ratio. If the prolonged aPTT corrects to within the reference range, it suggests a factor deficiency. If the aPTT remains prolonged, it suggests the presence of a factor inhibitor.

In this patient, the prolonged aPTT suggests a possible factor deficiency or inhibitor. The mixing study will help determine the underlying cause of the coagulation abnormality and guide further management.",
"A obstetrician is working in a developing country to help promote maternal health and fetal well being. While there, he delivers a baby who he suspects has congenital hypothyroidism, most likely caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake. Which of the following signs and symptoms would NOT be expected to be observed in this child?
Options:
(A): Hypotonia
(B): Diarrhea
(C): Umbilical hernia
(D): Mild jaundice
(E): Macroglossia
",Diarrhea,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Diarrhea.

Explanation:
Congenital hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It is commonly caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake during pregnancy. The signs and symptoms of congenital hypothyroidism can vary, but some common ones include hypotonia (low muscle tone), umbilical hernia, mild jaundice, and macroglossia (enlarged tongue). However, diarrhea is not typically associated with congenital hypothyroidism. Diarrhea is more commonly seen in conditions such as gastroenteritis or malabsorption disorders. Therefore, diarrhea would not be expected to be observed in a child with congenital hypothyroidism caused by inadequate maternal iodine intake.",
"A 33-year-old nurse is referred to an infectious disease specialist after she exhibited a PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration. She denies any cough, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, or night sweats over the last several months. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 120/81 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. An initial chest radiograph is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Isoniazid
(B): No management indicated
(C): Quantiferon gold
(D): Repeat PPD in 1 week
(E): Rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol
",Isoniazid,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Isoniazid.

Explanation:
This patient has a positive PPD skin test with 17 mm of induration, which is considered significant. However, she does not have any symptoms or findings suggestive of active tuberculosis (TB) infection. In this scenario, the most appropriate management is to treat her for latent TB infection (LTBI) to prevent progression to active disease. The preferred treatment for LTBI is isoniazid for 9 months. This regimen has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of developing active TB. Therefore, isoniazid is the most appropriate management for this patient. 

Option (B) No management indicated is incorrect because the patient has a positive PPD test and should be treated for LTBI to prevent progression to active TB.

Option (C) Quantiferon gold is incorrect because this test is used to diagnose TB infection, not to determine management.

Option (D) Repeat PPD in 1 week is incorrect because the patient already has a positive PPD test and does not need to repeat the test.

Option (E) Rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol is incorrect because this is the treatment regimen for active TB, not for LTBI.",
"An 81-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room by her son after witnessing the patient fall and hit her head. The son reports that the patient was in her usual state of health until she complained of chest palpitations. This startled her while she was climbing down the stairs and lead to a fall. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Medications are lisinopril, metoprolol, and warfarin. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 152/96 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 12/min, and pulse oximetry is 98% on room air. On physical examination, she is disoriented and at times difficult to arouse, the left pupil is 6 mm and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil is 2 mm and reactive to light. A right-sided visual field defect is appreciated on visual field testing. There is 1/5 strength on the right upper and lower extremity; as well as 5/5 strength in the left upper and lower extremity. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head is shown. Which of the following most likely explains this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Herniation of the uncus
(B): Herniation of the cingulate gyrus
(C): Occlusion of the anterior cerebral artery
(D): Occlusion of the basilar artery
(E): Occlusion of the anterior spinal artery
",Herniation of the uncus,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Herniation of the uncus.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a herniation of the uncus, which is a type of transtentorial herniation. The patient's disorientation and difficulty arousing suggest altered mental status, which can be caused by increased intracranial pressure due to herniation. The unequal pupil sizes, with the left pupil being dilated and non-reactive to light, and the right pupil being constricted and reactive to light, are known as anisocoria and are indicative of a herniation syndrome. The right-sided visual field defect is also consistent with a herniation syndrome. The weakness in the right upper and lower extremities is likely due to compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle, which contains descending motor fibers. The CT scan of the head may show findings such as midline shift, compression of the contralateral cerebral peduncle, and compression of the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve, which can explain the patient's symptoms.",
"A 67-year-old man with peripheral neuropathy comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after the results of serum protein electrophoresis showed monoclonal gammopathy. A complete blood count, serum creatinine, and serum electrolyte concentrations are within the reference ranges. A bone marrow biopsy shows 6% monoclonal plasma cells. Further analysis shows that class I major histocompatibility molecules are downregulated in these monoclonal plasma cells. The proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells is normally prevented by a class of immune cells that lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. Which of the following best describes this class of immune cells?
Options:
(A): CD8+ T lymphocytes
(B): Bone marrow-derived macrophages
(C): CD4+ T lymphocytes
(D): Natural killer cells
(E): Band neutrophils
",Natural killer cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Natural killer cells.

Explanation:
Natural killer (NK) cells are a class of immune cells that can lyse abnormal cells without the need for opsonization, priming, or prior activation. They play a crucial role in immune surveillance and defense against tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cells recognize and kill target cells through a balance of activating and inhibitory signals. In the case of monoclonal plasma cells with downregulated class I major histocompatibility molecules, NK cells can recognize these abnormal cells as targets for lysis. This is because class I major histocompatibility molecules are normally expressed on healthy cells and serve as inhibitory signals for NK cell activation. When these molecules are downregulated, NK cells are no longer inhibited and can target and kill the abnormal plasma cells. Therefore, NK cells are the class of immune cells that prevent the proliferation of these monoclonal plasma cells.",
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive muscle weakness for five months. She feels that the muscles in her shoulders and hips have been getting weaker and sometimes feel sore. She now has difficulty getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing her hair. She has also noticed new difficulty with swallowing solid foods, but has no trouble with liquids. She has a 5-year history of hyperlipidemia controlled with fluvastatin. Her maternal uncle died at age 26 from Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and her mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Vital signs are within normal limits. Neurologic examination shows moderate weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.7 g/dL
Leukocytes 11,200/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 33 mm/h
Serum
Creatine kinase 212 U/L
Lactate dehydrogenase 164 U/L
AST 34 U/L
ALT 35 U/L
Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy
(B): Inflammation of synovial spaces on ultrasound
(C): Perifascicular and perivascular infiltration on muscle biopsy
(D): Positive anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies
(E): Dystrophin gene mutation on genetic analysis
",Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a myopathy, characterized by progressive muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels. The presence of weakness in the arm abductors and hip flexors, along with the difficulty in getting up from chairs, climbing stairs, and combing hair, suggests proximal muscle weakness. The difficulty with swallowing solid foods but not liquids suggests involvement of the muscles involved in swallowing.

The laboratory findings show an elevated CK level, which is indicative of muscle damage. In addition, the normal white blood cell count and absence of inflammation in the synovial spaces on ultrasound make options (B) and (D) less likely.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is a muscular dystrophy, given the family history of Duchenne's muscular dystrophy in her maternal uncle. Intrafascicular infiltration on muscle biopsy is characteristic of muscular dystrophies, including Duchenne's muscular dystrophy. This infiltration represents the replacement of muscle fibers with connective tissue and fat.

Therefore, the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis in this patient is a muscle biopsy showing intrafascicular infiltration.",
"A 41-year-old man presents to the emergency room with sudden onset of blurry vision one hour ago. He states that he was resting at home when he noticed he had difficulty reading. Currently, he is also starting to see double, and is seeing two images on top of each other. Earlier today, he felt ill with nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea, which he attributed to food he had eaten at a picnic the day before. When asked which foods he ate, he lists potato salad, a hamburger, deviled eggs, and pickles made by his neighbor. He also heard that his friend who went to the picnic with him has developed similar symptoms and was seen in another hospital earlier. While in the emergency room, the patient’s temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), pulse is 75/min, blood pressure is 122/84 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Cranial nerve exam is notable for fixed pupillary dilation, and difficulty depressing both eyes. The remainder of his exam is normal. Which of the following is the pathogenesis of this patient’s presentation?
Options:
(A): Decreased acetylcholine release
(B): Overactivation of adenylate cyclase
(C): Release of interferon-gamma
(D): Degradation of phospholipids
(E): Inhibition of GABA release
",Decreased acetylcholine release,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Decreased acetylcholine release.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with botulism, which is caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. The toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, double vision, and difficulty depressing both eyes are consistent with the involvement of cranial nerves, specifically the oculomotor nerve (CN III) and the abducens nerve (CN VI). The fixed pupillary dilation also suggests dysfunction of the pupillary sphincter muscle, which is innervated by the oculomotor nerve. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and watery diarrhea are also consistent with botulism, as the toxin can be ingested through contaminated food. Therefore, the pathogenesis of this patient's presentation is decreased acetylcholine release.",
"A 4-week-old female newborn is brought to the physician because of increasing yellowing of her eyes and skin for 2 weeks. The mother has noticed that the girl's stools have become pale over the past week. She was breastfed since birth but her parents switched her to formula feeds recently after reading on the internet that breastfeeding could be the cause of her current symptoms. The patient was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. She appears healthy. Vital signs are within normal limits. She is at the 50th percentile for length and at the 60th percentile for weight. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum studies show:
Bilirubin
Total 15 mg/dL
Direct 12.3 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 2007 U/L
AST 53 U/L
ALT 45 U/L
γ-glutamyl transferase 154 U/L
Blood group A positive
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): Galactosemia
(B): Biliary atresia
(C): Crigler–Najjar syndrome
(D): Breast milk jaundice
(E): Dubin-Johnson syndrome
",Biliary atresia,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Biliary atresia.

Explanation:
Biliary atresia is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Biliary atresia is a rare condition in which there is a blockage or absence of the bile ducts, leading to the accumulation of bile in the liver. This can result in jaundice, pale stools, and hepatomegaly. The presentation of increasing yellowing of the eyes and skin, pale stools, and hepatomegaly in a 4-week-old infant is highly suggestive of biliary atresia.

Galactosemia is a metabolic disorder in which the body is unable to break down galactose, a sugar found in milk. This condition typically presents in the first few days of life with symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and failure to thrive. The patient in this case has been breastfed since birth and only recently switched to formula feeds, making galactosemia less likely.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin in the liver. This results in the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, leading to jaundice. However, the presentation of pale stools and hepatomegaly in this case is more consistent with biliary atresia.

Breast milk jaundice is a common condition in which breastfeeding can cause a mild increase in bilirubin levels in the newborn. However, breast milk jaundice typically presents in the second week of life and is self-limiting. The persistence of symptoms beyond the second week and the presence of pale stools and hepatomegaly make biliary atresia a more likely diagnosis.

Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by impaired bilirubin transport in the liver, leading to the accumulation of conjugated bilirubin in the blood. This condition does not typically present in infancy and is not associated with pale stools or hepatomegaly. Therefore, it is an unlikely diagnosis in this case.",
"A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and progressive perioral numbness for the past 24 hours. 3 days ago, he underwent a total thyroidectomy for treatment of papillary thyroid cancer. His only medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes a spasm in the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. Which of the following ECG findings are most likely in this patient?
Options:
(A): Torsade de pointes
(B): QT prolongation
(C): U waves
(D): Peaked T waves
(E): PR prolongation
",QT prolongation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) QT prolongation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including nausea, abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, and perioral numbness, along with the observation of a hand spasm, are consistent with hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia is a common complication following thyroidectomy due to injury or removal of the parathyroid glands, which are responsible for regulating calcium levels in the body.

One of the ECG findings associated with hypocalcemia is QT prolongation. Hypocalcemia can affect the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential, leading to delayed ventricular repolarization and prolonged QT interval on the ECG. This can increase the risk of arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes, a specific type of ventricular tachycardia characterized by a twisting pattern on the ECG.

While torsade de pointes is a potential arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation, it is not the most likely finding in this patient. The presence of symptoms such as nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea, along with the observation of a hand spasm, suggests hypocalcemia as the underlying cause. Therefore, the most likely ECG finding in this patient is QT prolongation.",
"A 68-year-old woman presents with left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation. She describes the pain as 'crampy'. She also says she has suffered from mild constipation for the past few years. The patient denies any recent weight change or urinary symptoms. Her last menstrual period was 16 years ago. Her body temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 16/min, and blood pressure is 133/87 mm Hg. On physical examination, tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant is present. The laboratory studies are presented as follows:
Hemoglobin 13.2 mg/dL
Hematocrit 48%
Leukocyte count 16,000/mm³
Neutrophils 89%
Bands 5%
Eosinophils 0%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 11%
Monocytes 0%
Platelet count 380,000/mm³
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Diverticulitis
(B): Hypothyroidism
(C): Adenocarcinoma of the colon
(D): Chronic inflammatory bowel disease
(E): Irritable bowel syndrome
",Diverticulitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Diverticulitis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of left lower quadrant pain that worsens with defecation, along with tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant, is consistent with diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is inflammation or infection of the diverticula, which are small pouches that can develop in the lining of the colon. The pain in diverticulitis is typically described as crampy and can be associated with other symptoms such as fever, elevated white blood cell count, and constipation or diarrhea. The patient's laboratory findings of an elevated white blood cell count (16,000/mm³) with a predominance of neutrophils (89%) and bands (5%) further support the diagnosis of diverticulitis. Hypothyroidism, adenocarcinoma of the colon, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings.",
"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for erectile dysfunction. He states that for the past month he has been unable to engage in sexual intercourse with his wife despite having appropriate sexual desire. He also endorses deep and burning buttock and hip pain when walking, which is relieved by rest. The patient states that he does not have erections at night or in the morning. His past medical history is notable for diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, and he has a 40 pack-year smoking history. Physical exam is notable for weak lower extremity and femoral pulses. Which of the following is the most specific etiology of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Anxiety
(B): Aortoiliac atherosclerosis
(C): Diabetic neuropathy
(D): Spinal stenosis
(E): Vascular claudication
",Aortoiliac atherosclerosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Aortoiliac atherosclerosis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of erectile dysfunction, buttock and hip pain when walking (claudication), and weak lower extremity and femoral pulses are suggestive of a vascular etiology. Aortoiliac atherosclerosis is the most specific etiology in this case. Atherosclerosis is a common cause of erectile dysfunction in older men, and it can also lead to claudication symptoms due to decreased blood flow to the lower extremities. The weak lower extremity and femoral pulses further support the diagnosis of aortoiliac atherosclerosis. Anxiety, diabetic neuropathy, and spinal stenosis are less likely to cause this combination of symptoms.",
"A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic glomerulonephritis due to IgA nephropathy presents to your office with bone pain. Which of the following laboratory findings would you most expect upon analysis of this patient's serum?
Options:
(A): Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
(B): Decreased PTH, increased calcium, increased phosphate, increased calcitriol
(C): Increased PTH, increased calcium, decreased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
(D): Decreased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol
(E): Normal PTH, normal calcium, normal phosphate, normal calcitriol
","Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol",Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, decreased calcitriol.

In chronic glomerulonephritis, there is a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), leading to impaired kidney function. This results in several abnormalities in the serum levels of various substances.

Increased PTH (parathyroid hormone) is expected in this patient. The decrease in GFR leads to decreased calcium excretion by the kidneys, causing hypercalcemia. In response, the parathyroid glands release more PTH to increase calcium reabsorption from the bones and enhance renal calcium reabsorption. This compensatory mechanism helps maintain normal serum calcium levels.

Decreased calcium levels are expected in this patient due to the impaired kidney function and increased PTH levels. The increased PTH stimulates bone resorption, releasing calcium into the bloodstream. Additionally, the impaired kidney function reduces the ability to excrete phosphate, leading to increased phosphate levels. The increased phosphate levels further contribute to the decrease in serum calcium levels by forming calcium-phosphate complexes.

Increased phosphate levels are also expected in this patient due to the impaired kidney function. The kidneys play a crucial role in phosphate excretion, and when their function is compromised, phosphate levels rise.

Decreased calcitriol (active form of vitamin D) levels are expected in this patient. The impaired kidney function reduces the production of calcitriol, which is normally synthesized in the kidneys. Calcitriol plays a crucial role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis by enhancing intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate. The decrease in calcitriol levels further contributes to the decrease in serum calcium levels.

Overall, the combination of increased PTH, decreased calcium, increased phosphate, and decreased calcitriol is characteristic of chronic kidney disease and is expected in a patient with chronic glomerulonephritis.",
"A medical researcher is studying the physiology of the immune system in order to better understand the effects of HIV on patients. He isolates a group of cells that are shown by flow cytometry to be positive for the cell surface marker CD8. He then mixes this cell population with a group of infected cells, crosslinks extracellular interactions, and immunoprecipitates the CD8 protein. He identifies a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. Which of the following best describes the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified?
Options:
(A): Binds complement proteins on the cell surface
(B): Binds endogenous peptides that are present in the endosome
(C): Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel
(D): Binds exogenous peptides that are present in the endosome
(E): Binds exogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel
",Binds endogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Binds exogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the researcher immunoprecipitated the CD8 protein and identified a protein bound to CD8 that is composed of two chains from an adjacent cell. This suggests that the identified protein is an MHC class I molecule, which is responsible for presenting peptides to CD8+ T cells. 

The function of MHC class I molecules is to bind and present peptides derived from exogenous sources, such as viral or bacterial proteins, that have been transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) channel. These peptides are then presented on the cell surface to CD8+ T cells, which can recognize and respond to them. 

Therefore, the primary function of the protein that was most likely identified is to bind exogenous peptides that have been transported by the TAP channel.",
"A 61-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with chest pain. He states that he is worried about his heart, as his father died at age 62 from a heart attack. He reports that his chest pain worsens with large meals and spicy foods and improves with calcium carbonate. He denies dyspnea on exertion and an ECG is normal. What is the most likely cause of this patient's pain?
Options:
(A): Partially occluded coronary artery
(B): Esophageal adenocarcinoma
(C): Umbilical hernia
(D): Gastroesophageal junction incompetence
(E): Intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction
",Gastroesophageal junction incompetence,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Gastroesophageal junction incompetence.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of chest pain worsening with large meals and spicy foods, and improving with calcium carbonate, are suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is caused by the incompetence of the gastroesophageal junction, allowing stomach acid to flow back into the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as chest pain, heartburn, and regurgitation. The normal ECG and absence of dyspnea on exertion make it less likely to be a cardiac cause. Esophageal adenocarcinoma, umbilical hernia, and intestinal metaplasia at the gastroesophageal junction are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and history.",
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the clinic because of tearing and a foreign body sensation in her eyes bilaterally, which has gradually worsened over the last several weeks. She also notes having occasional palpitations, nervousness, sweating, and heat intolerance. Her past medical history is unremarkable. She reports a 20-pack-year smoking history and is currently a daily smoker. Physical examination shows an anxious, trembling woman. She has eyelid retraction bilaterally, with an inability to fully close her eyes. Her extraocular motility is limited on upgaze. There is no thyromegaly, and no thyroid nodules are noted. Laboratory studies reveal a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.1 μU/mL and total T4 of 42 μg/dL. Thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin is positive. CT scan of the orbits shows proptosis and marked enlargement of the extraocular muscle with sparing of the tendons. Which of the following would most likely transiently worsen this patient’s eye symptoms?
Options:
(A): External orbital radiation
(B): Selenium supplementation
(C): Smoking cessation
(D): Systemic corticosteroids
(E): Treatment with radioactive iodine
",Treatment with radioactive iodine,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Treatment with radioactive iodine.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario is presenting with symptoms consistent with Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by hyperthyroidism and thyroid eye disease. The presence of eyelid retraction, inability to fully close the eyes, and limited extraocular motility on upgaze are all indicative of thyroid eye disease.

Treatment with radioactive iodine is the most likely option to transiently worsen the patient's eye symptoms. Radioactive iodine is commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism in Graves' disease by ablating the overactive thyroid tissue. However, it can lead to a temporary exacerbation of the eye symptoms due to the release of thyroid antigens during the destruction of the thyroid tissue. This can result in an inflammatory response and worsening of the eye symptoms.

External orbital radiation (option A) is a treatment option for severe cases of thyroid eye disease, but it is not expected to transiently worsen the eye symptoms.

Selenium supplementation (option B) has been shown to have some benefit in reducing the progression of mild thyroid eye disease, but it is not expected to transiently worsen the eye symptoms.

Smoking cessation (option C) is important in the management of thyroid eye disease as smoking is known to worsen the condition. However, quitting smoking is not expected to transiently worsen the eye symptoms.

Systemic corticosteroids (option D) are commonly used to manage the acute inflammatory phase of thyroid eye disease. They can help reduce inflammation and improve eye symptoms. Therefore, systemic corticosteroids would not be expected to transiently worsen the eye symptoms.",
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to a pediatrician by his parents for evaluation of frequent bed wetting during the night. A detailed history reveals that there has been no history of urinary incontinence during the day since the boy was 4 years of age, but that he has never been dry at night continuously for 1 week. There is no history of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy. On physical examination, the boy’s vital signs are stable. His neurologic and abdominal examinations are completely normal. His laboratory investigations are as follows:
Urine-specific gravity (first-morning sample) 1.035
Urine red blood cells Absent
Urine pus cells Absent
Urine culture Negative
Which of the following is the next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Ultrasonogram of the urinary bladder and kidneys
(B): Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine
(C): Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm
(D): Treatment with oral oxybutynin
(E): Treatment with oral imipramine
",Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Reassuring the parents and use of an enuresis alarm.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the 7-year-old boy has primary nocturnal enuresis, which is bedwetting that occurs during sleep without any daytime urinary incontinence. This is a common condition in children and is usually due to a maturational delay in bladder control. The absence of urinary tract infections, urgency, frequency, or hesitancy, as well as normal physical examination findings, suggests that there is no underlying medical or structural abnormality causing the enuresis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to reassure the parents and use an enuresis alarm. Enuresis alarms are considered the first-line treatment for primary nocturnal enuresis. These alarms work by detecting the first drops of urine and producing a loud sound or vibration to wake the child, conditioning them to wake up and empty their bladder when they feel the urge to urinate. The use of an enuresis alarm has been shown to be effective in achieving long-term dryness in children with primary nocturnal enuresis.

Ultrasonogram of the urinary bladder and kidneys (option A) is not indicated in this case because there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract abnormality.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine (option B) is not indicated in this case because there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of a spinal abnormality.

Treatment with oral oxybutynin (option D) is not indicated in this case because oxybutynin is primarily used for the treatment of overactive bladder and urge incontinence, which are not present in this patient.

Treatment with oral imipramine (option E) is not indicated in this case because imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used for the treatment of enuresis, but it is typically reserved for cases that do not respond to other treatments or for children with significant psychosocial distress related to their enuresis. In this case, reassurance and the use of an enuresis alarm are the appropriate initial management options.",
"A 52-year-old man with a history of gastric cancer that was treated with subtotal gastrectomy dies in a motor vehicle collision. At autopsy, examination of the spinal cord shows unilateral atrophy of the neurons in the area indicated by the arrow. Neurological examination of the patient when he was still alive would most likely have shown which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Decreased sense of temperature in the ipsilateral arm
(B): Decreased strength of the contralateral leg
(C): Decreased vibratory sense in the ipsilateral arm
(D): Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg
(E): Decreased sense of crude touch in the contralateral arm
",Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg.

Explanation:
The unilateral atrophy of neurons in the spinal cord indicates a lesion affecting the dorsal columns, which are responsible for transmitting proprioceptive and vibratory sensations. The dorsal columns carry information from the ipsilateral leg, so a lesion in this area would result in decreased positional sense in the ipsilateral leg. This would manifest as difficulty in accurately perceiving the position of the leg without looking at it, leading to impaired coordination and balance. The other options are not consistent with the findings of unilateral atrophy in the spinal cord.",
"A 24-year-old pregnant woman at 28 weeks gestation presents to the emergency department with complaints of fever with chills and pain in her knee and ankle joints for the past 2 days. She also complains of headaches and difficulty moving her neck. Further questioning reveals that she had a tick bite on her arm while gardening a few days ago. Past medical history is noncontributory. She takes a multivitamin with iron and folate every day and has been receiving regular prenatal care and the pregnancy is progressing normally. On examination, an erythematous rash is seen on her right arm, as shown in the accompanying photograph. Her obstetric examination is normal. Ultrasound of the fetus is reassuring with a normal heartbeat and no gross abnormalities. A specimen is collected to test for Lyme disease. What is the next best step for this patient?
Options:
(A): Ibuprofen
(B): Doxycycline
(C): Tetracycline
(D): Amoxicilin
(E): Gentamicin
",Amoxicilin,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Amoxicillin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of a tick bite, symptoms of fever, joint pain, headache, and difficulty moving her neck, along with the presence of an erythematous rash, the most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of infected black-legged ticks.

Amoxicillin is the recommended treatment for Lyme disease in pregnant women. It is safe to use during pregnancy and has been shown to effectively treat the infection. Doxycycline and tetracycline, which are also effective against Lyme disease, are contraindicated in pregnancy as they can cause harm to the developing fetus. Ibuprofen and gentamicin are not appropriate treatments for Lyme disease.

It is important to treat Lyme disease promptly to prevent complications and ensure the health of both the mother and the fetus.",
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with a four month history of fatigue and weakness. The weakness has been progressive to the point where she cannot climb stairs and stand from a sitting position. She has only had one menstrual period in the last four months and has never been pregnant. She smokes a pack of cigarettes every day and does not take any medications. Her temperature is 98°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 160/100 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 15/min. She is obese with a significant pannus. Abdominal striae are present. Her laboratory workup is notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 142 mEq/L
Cl-: 102 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 314 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL
AST: 9 U/L
ALT: 8 U/L
24-hour urinary cortisol: 470 µg (< 300 µg)
Serum cortisol 30 µg/mL (5-23 µg/dL)
Serum adrenocorticotropin-releasing hormone (ACTH) 2 pg/mL (> 5 pg/mL)

A 48-hour high dose dexamethasone suppression trial shows that her serum cortisol levels do not decrease. What is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): MRI of the adrenal glands
(B): MRI of the chest
(C): MRI of the pituitary gland
(D): Low dose dexamethasone suppression test
(E): Inferior petrosal sinus sampling
",MRI of the adrenal glands,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) MRI of the adrenal glands.

Explanation:
This patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and lack of suppression of cortisol levels on a high dose dexamethasone suppression test are consistent with Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by excessive cortisol production, which can be caused by either adrenal or pituitary pathology. In this case, the low ACTH level suggests that the source of excess cortisol is likely adrenal in origin. Therefore, the next step in management should be to localize the source of excess cortisol production. An MRI of the adrenal glands is the most appropriate imaging study to evaluate for adrenal adenomas or other adrenal pathology. This will help determine if surgical intervention is necessary. MRI of the chest (B) would be indicated if there were suspicion for an ectopic source of ACTH production, such as a bronchial carcinoid tumor. MRI of the pituitary gland (C) would be indicated if there were suspicion for a pituitary adenoma causing excess ACTH production. A low dose dexamethasone suppression test (D) is not necessary in this case, as the high dose dexamethasone suppression test has already shown lack of cortisol suppression. Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (E) is a more invasive procedure used to differentiate between pituitary and ectopic sources of ACTH production in cases of Cushing's syndrome. It is not the most appropriate next step in this patient.",
"A 67-year-woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of progressively increasing numbness and tingling in her fingers and toes. Her last cycle of chemotherapy with vincristine was 1 week ago. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch in all distal extremities. Knee and ankle deep tendon reflexes are decreased. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s peripheral neuropathy?
Options:
(A): Inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization
(B): Creation of free radicals that unwind DNA
(C): Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase
(D): Formation of cross-links between strands of DNA
(E): Incorporation of false pyrimidine analogues into DNA
",Inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization.

Explanation:
Vincristine, a chemotherapy drug, is known to cause peripheral neuropathy. The most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's peripheral neuropathy is the inhibition of beta-tubulin polymerization. Vincristine binds to tubulin, a protein involved in microtubule formation, and inhibits its polymerization. This disruption of microtubule formation leads to impaired axonal transport and nerve damage, resulting in peripheral neuropathy. The symptoms of numbness and tingling in the fingers and toes, as well as decreased sensation and reflexes, are consistent with vincristine-induced peripheral neuropathy.",
"A 68-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of painless hematuria. A CT scan of the urinary tract shows areas of bladder wall thickening. Cystoscopy shows several sessile masses with central necrosis arising from the bladder wall. A biopsy specimen of the bladder masses shows moderately differentiated urothelial cells with abundant mitotic figures and nuclear atypia. The patient most likely has a history of exposure to which of the following?
Options:
(A): Ionizing radiation
(B): Aromatic amines
(C): Aflatoxins
(D): Vinyl chloride
(E): Radon
",Aromatic amines,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Aromatic amines.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's presentation is consistent with bladder cancer. Bladder cancer is strongly associated with exposure to certain chemicals, and one of the most well-known risk factors is exposure to aromatic amines. Aromatic amines are commonly found in industrial chemicals, such as those used in the dye industry, rubber industry, and chemical manufacturing. Occupational exposure to aromatic amines has been linked to an increased risk of bladder cancer.

Ionizing radiation (option A) is a risk factor for other types of cancer, such as thyroid cancer and leukemia, but it is not a known risk factor for bladder cancer.

Aflatoxins (option C) are toxins produced by certain molds that can contaminate food, particularly grains and nuts. Aflatoxin exposure is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer, but not bladder cancer.

Vinyl chloride (option D) is a chemical used in the production of PVC pipes and other plastic products. Chronic exposure to vinyl chloride has been linked to an increased risk of liver cancer, but not bladder cancer.

Radon (option E) is a radioactive gas that can be found in homes and buildings. Prolonged exposure to high levels of radon is a known risk factor for lung cancer, but it is not associated with bladder cancer.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and the known risk factors for bladder cancer, the most likely history of exposure is to aromatic amines.",
"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician with her father for evaluation of her short stature. She feels well overall, but is concerned because all of her friends are taller than her. Her birth weight was normal. Her father reports he had a short stature during his teenage years; he is currently 177 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall. She is at the 2ndpercentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Breast development is Tanner stage 2. Pubic and axillary hair is absent. An x-ray of the left hand and wrist shows a bone age of 11 years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Genetic karyotyping
(B): Pelvic ultrasound
(C): Measure serum dehydroepiandrosterone levels
(D): Reassurance and follow-up
(E): MRI of the brain
",Reassurance and follow-up,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Reassurance and follow-up.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the 14-year-old girl has a short stature, but her growth is consistent with her bone age. Her bone age of 11 years indicates that her growth is delayed compared to her chronological age, but it is not significantly delayed. Additionally, her breast development is consistent with Tanner stage 2, indicating that she is in the early stages of puberty. 

Given these findings, it is likely that the girl is experiencing constitutional growth delay, which is a common cause of short stature in adolescents. Constitutional growth delay is a temporary delay in growth that is usually familial and self-corrects over time. It is often associated with a delayed onset of puberty, as seen in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and follow-up. The girl should be reassured that her short stature is likely due to constitutional growth delay and that she is expected to have a normal growth spurt and reach a normal adult height. Regular follow-up visits can be scheduled to monitor her growth and ensure that she is progressing appropriately. No further diagnostic tests or interventions are necessary at this time.",
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of facial swelling that started 5 days ago. Two weeks ago, he had a sore throat that resolved spontaneously. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 94/67 mm Hg. Examination shows pitting edema of the upper and lower extremities as well as periorbital edema. The abdomen is mildly distended. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.1 g/dL
Serum
Albumin 2.1 g/dL
Total cholesterol 270 mg/dL
Triglycerides 175 mg/dL
Urine
Blood negative
Glucose negative
Protein 4+
Leukocyte esterase negative
A renal biopsy of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?""
Options:
(A): Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy
(B): Subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy
(C): Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluoresence
(D): Normal light microscopy findings
(E): Effacement of foot processes of podocytes on light microscopy
",Normal light microscopy findings,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (A) Mesangial proliferation on light microscopy.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this patient most likely has acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). APSGN is a type of glomerulonephritis that occurs following a streptococcal infection, such as a sore throat or skin infection. It is most commonly seen in children.

In APSGN, the renal biopsy findings typically show mesangial proliferation on light microscopy. Mesangial cells are located in the glomerulus and play a role in maintaining the structure and function of the glomerulus. In APSGN, these cells become enlarged and proliferate, leading to an increase in mesangial matrix.

The other options are not consistent with the findings seen in APSGN. Subepithelial dense deposits on electron microscopy are seen in membranous glomerulonephritis. Deposits of IgG and C3 at the glomerular basement membrane on immunofluorescence are seen in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Effacement of foot processes of podocytes on light microscopy is seen in minimal change disease. Normal light microscopy findings would not be expected in a patient with clinical and laboratory findings consistent with APSGN.",
"A 60-year-old man is referred to a dermatologist by his family physician for management of a rare case of dermatitis that has not responded to standard therapy with corticosteroids. The patient’s medical history is unremarkable, and he is currently working reduced hours at his job as an accountant. Physical examination reveals confluent scaly patches, plaques, and generalized erythroderma along the torso and lower extremities (see image). There is also a solid skin lesion with a diameter greater than 1 cm. The dermatologist suspects a malignancy and orders a biopsy. Which of the following is the most accurate description of this condition?
Options:
(A): Vascular tumor containing spindle cells
(B): Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous–apocrine germ
(C): Tumor arising from melanocytes
(D): Tumor arising from cutaneous T cells
(E): Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes
",Tumor arising from cutaneous T cells,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Tumor arising from cutaneous T cells.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of confluent scaly patches, plaques, generalized erythroderma, and a solid skin lesion, along with the lack of response to corticosteroid therapy, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). CTCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from malignant transformation of T lymphocytes in the skin.

Option (A): Vascular tumor containing spindle cells is not the correct answer because CTCL does not typically present with spindle cells or have a vascular component.

Option (B): Tumor arising from the folliculosebaceous–apocrine germ is not the correct answer because CTCL does not arise from the hair follicles, sebaceous glands, or apocrine glands.

Option (C): Tumor arising from melanocytes is not the correct answer because CTCL does not involve melanocytes, which are responsible for melanin production and are associated with conditions such as melanoma.

Option (E): Tumor arising from epidermal keratinocytes is not the correct answer because CTCL does not arise from the keratinocytes, which are the main cells of the epidermis.",
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because she has been feeling very stressed over the past several months. During this period, she has found it difficult to relax. She states that her head is full of worries. She works at an accountant's office and reports difficulty in concentrating on her work. She has been working longer shifts because one of her coworkers is on vacation and reports feeling more tired than usual. She is married and frequently fights with her husband. The patient states that in order to deal with her stress, she goes shopping. While shopping, she steals small trivial items and feels immediately relieved thereafter. She discards the objects she steals and has feelings of shame and guilt about her actions. Her husband is concerned about her behavior, but she is unable to stop shoplifting. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person, place, and time. She reports feeling anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Administration of lithium
(B): Interpersonal therapy
(C): Psychodynamic psychotherapy
(D): Cognitive behavioral therapy
(E): Motivational interviewing
",Cognitive behavioral therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Cognitive behavioral therapy.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is experiencing symptoms of stress, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, and engaging in impulsive behavior (shoplifting) as a way to cope with her stress. These symptoms are suggestive of an anxiety disorder, specifically generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and possibly impulse control disorder. 

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It has been shown to be effective in treating anxiety disorders, including GAD. CBT can help the patient identify and challenge the irrational thoughts and beliefs that contribute to her anxiety and impulsive behavior. It can also provide her with coping strategies and relaxation techniques to manage her stress more effectively.

Administration of lithium (A) is not indicated in this case. Lithium is primarily used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, not anxiety disorders.

Interpersonal therapy (B) may be helpful in addressing the patient's marital conflicts, but it does not specifically target her anxiety symptoms or impulsive behavior.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy (C) focuses on exploring unconscious conflicts and unresolved issues from the past. While it may be beneficial for some patients, it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient who is experiencing acute symptoms of anxiety and impulsive behavior.

Motivational interviewing (E) is a counseling approach that is typically used to help individuals resolve ambivalence and increase motivation to change problematic behaviors. While it may be useful in addressing the patient's shoplifting behavior, it does not specifically target her anxiety symptoms.

In summary, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient as it can address her anxiety symptoms and impulsive behavior.",
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a change in his behavior over the past few months. Initially, the patient was noted to be behaving inappropriately including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly. This has progressed to a worsening of his memory and trouble caring for himself. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 162/103 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an elderly man who laughs inappropriately at times and who is a poor historian. When he is engaged in conversation, he exhibits word finding difficulty and is rather inattentive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Alzheimer dementia
(B): Frontotemporal dementia
(C): Kluver-Bucy syndrome
(D): Lewy body dementia
(E): Vascular dementia
",Frontotemporal dementia,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Frontotemporal dementia.

Explanation:
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive changes in behavior, personality, and language. In this case, the patient's initial presentation of inappropriate behavior, including using foul language and grabbing people unexpectedly, is consistent with the behavioral variant of FTD. As the disease progresses, the patient's memory and ability to care for himself worsen, which is also characteristic of FTD.

The physical exam findings of inappropriate laughter and poor historian further support the diagnosis of FTD. Inappropriate laughter is a common symptom of FTD and is often seen in the early stages of the disease. Additionally, the patient's word finding difficulty and inattentiveness during conversation are consistent with the language variant of FTD.

Alzheimer's dementia (option A) typically presents with memory impairment as the primary symptom, rather than behavioral changes. Kluver-Bucy syndrome (option C) is a rare condition characterized by hyperorality, hypersexuality, and visual agnosia, which are not described in this patient. Lewy body dementia (option D) is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, and fluctuating cognition, which are not mentioned in this case. Vascular dementia (option E) is caused by cerebrovascular disease and typically presents with a stepwise decline in cognitive function, which is not described in this patient.",
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother for a rash on his trunk, which he has had for the past 2 days. She notes that he is eating less and is more cranky than usual. His birth history is insignificant, and his immunizations are up to date. Vital signs include: temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The rash features thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. Fluid samples from the lesions are sent for analysis to a microbiology lab. The results reveal an infection by the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. The patient is diagnosed with staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Which of the following is involved with the primary defense in response to the bacteria and toxins produced by this organism?
Options:
(A): Immunoglobulin- IgG
(B): Immunoglobulin- IgE
(C): Immunoglobulin- IgD
(D): Immunoglobulin- IgA
(E): Immunoglobulin- IgM
",Immunoglobulin- IgM,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Immunoglobulin- IgM.

Explanation:
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) is caused by an infection with Staphylococcus aureus, a gram-positive bacterium. In SSSS, the bacteria produce exfoliative toxins that cause the characteristic rash of thin-walled, fluid-filled blisters that rupture easily. 

In response to the bacteria and toxins produced by S. aureus, the primary defense mechanism involves the production of immunoglobulins, which are antibodies that help to neutralize and eliminate the bacteria and toxins. 

Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first antibody produced in response to an infection. It is a pentameric antibody that is effective in activating the complement system, which helps to destroy the bacteria and toxins. IgM is involved in the primary immune response and is particularly important in the early stages of infection. 

Therefore, in the case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, IgM is involved in the primary defense against the bacteria and toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus.",
"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with dry cough, shortness of breath, and low-grade fever that began 6 days ago. He also reports that he has had 3 episodes of watery diarrhea per day for the last 2 days. He appears slightly pale. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 65/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 140/78 mm Hg. Diffuse crackles are heard over bibasilar lung fields. Laboratory studies show:

An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?""
Options:
(A): Levofloxacin
(B): Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole
(C): Amoxicillin
(D): Oseltamivir
(E): Rifampin
",Levofloxacin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Levofloxacin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with atypical pathogens. The patient has symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, including cough, shortness of breath, and crackles on lung examination. The patchy infiltrates seen on chest x-ray are consistent with pneumonia. The patient also has leukocytosis, which is a common finding in bacterial pneumonia.

Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that provides coverage against typical and atypical pathogens commonly associated with CAP, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Levofloxacin is recommended as a first-line treatment for CAP in patients who require hospitalization or have risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (B) is a combination antibiotic that is commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infections and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. It does not provide adequate coverage against the typical and atypical pathogens associated with CAP.

Amoxicillin (C) is a penicillin antibiotic that is effective against gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, it does not provide coverage against atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

Oseltamivir (D) is an antiviral medication that is used for the treatment of influenza. It is not indicated for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia.

Rifampin (E) is an antibiotic that is primarily used for the treatment of tuberculosis and certain other bacterial infections. It is not a first-line treatment for CAP and does not provide coverage against atypical pathogens.",
"A transvaginal ultrasound shows an intrauterine heteroechoic mass with numerous anechoic spaces and no identifiable fetus or amniotic fluid. Both the ovaries are enlarged and have multiple thin-walled, septated cysts with clear content. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the ovarian findings?
Options:
(A): Chocolate cysts
(B): Corpus luteum cysts
(C): Yolk sac tumor
(D): Luteoma of pregnancy
(E): Theca leutein cysts
",Theca leutein cysts,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Theca leutein cysts.

Explanation:
The ultrasound findings described in the question, including enlarged ovaries with multiple thin-walled, septated cysts, are consistent with theca lutein cysts. Theca lutein cysts are associated with high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which can occur in conditions such as molar pregnancies and multiple gestations. These cysts can range in size from normal to 10 to 15 cm and may cause pressure symptoms. Approximately 30% of pregnant women with theca lutein cysts may also have hirsutism or virilization. The lack of a solid component distinguishes theca lutein cysts from other ovarian masses such as luteomas or malignancies. It is important to rule out trophoblastic disease in women presenting with theca lutein cysts in early pregnancy.",
"A 75-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her son because of a 2-day history of fever, headache, malaise, and dry cough. The patient lives with her son and his family and her son reports that other members of the family have had similar symptoms during the past week but that he has not had any symptoms. The result of a polymerase chain reaction test confirms that the woman is infected with a virus that has a helical capsid and a segmented genome. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the son being free of symptoms?
Options:
(A): Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin
(B): Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression
(C): Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions
(D): Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene
(E): High concentration of circulating T cells
",Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin.

Explanation:
The fact that the son is free of symptoms while other family members have similar symptoms suggests that he has some form of immunity against the virus. The virus in question has a helical capsid and a segmented genome, which is characteristic of influenza viruses. Influenza viruses have a protein called hemagglutinin on their surface, which is responsible for binding to host cells and initiating infection. 

Serum antibodies against hemagglutinin are produced by the immune system in response to previous exposure to the virus or vaccination. These antibodies can neutralize the virus and prevent it from infecting cells. Therefore, if the son has serum antibodies against hemagglutinin, he would be protected from infection and remain asymptomatic.

The other options are less likely explanations for the son being free of symptoms:
- Downregulation of ICAM-1 expression: ICAM-1 is a cellular receptor that some viruses, such as rhinoviruses, use to enter host cells. However, this option is not relevant to the virus described in the scenario.
- Protease-resistant antibodies in nasal secretions: While antibodies in nasal secretions can help prevent respiratory infections, the presence of protease-resistant antibodies specifically would not explain the son being free of symptoms.
- Homozygous mutation in the CCR5 gene: The CCR5 gene is involved in the entry of certain strains of HIV into host cells. This option is not relevant to the virus described in the scenario.
- High concentration of circulating T cells: While T cells are an important part of the immune response, a high concentration of circulating T cells alone would not explain the son being free of symptoms.",
"A 71-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine visit. His psychiatric history is significant for major depression with psychotic features. He was diagnosed after his wife died from pancreatic cancer four years earlier. Three years ago, he deliberately overdosed on sleeping pills. Today, he feels well but still wakes up frequently at night and cannot sleep through the night. He lives alone in his apartment and has no children. He does not possess a firearm at home but has access to weapons at a local hunting club. The patient currently denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm. He takes sertraline and olanzapine. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for suicide in this patient?
Options:
(A): Previous suicide attempt
(B): History of psychosis
(C): Access to firearms
(D): Sleeping disorder
(E): Age
""
",Previous suicide attempt,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Previous suicide attempt.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a significant psychiatric history of major depression with psychotic features and a previous suicide attempt by overdosing on sleeping pills. Previous suicide attempts are one of the strongest risk factors for future suicide attempts or completed suicide. Individuals who have attempted suicide in the past are at a higher risk of attempting suicide again compared to those who have not. It is important to note that the patient currently denies suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm, but the presence of a previous suicide attempt still increases the risk.

While a history of psychosis (option B) and access to firearms (option C) can also be risk factors for suicide, the strongest risk factor in this case is the previous suicide attempt. It is important to assess and address all risk factors in order to provide appropriate care and support for the patient.",
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized rash for 3 days. During this period, he has had severe itching and was not able to sleep well. He has also had fever, headache, and some muscle pain. Five days ago, he had a runny nose which subsided with over-the-counter medications. He returned from a camping trip 1 week ago. He attends a daycare center. The patient is at the 55th percentile for height and at the 50th percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.7°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 96/60 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows several macules, papules, and crusted lesions over his face, trunk, and extremities. There are a few fluid-filled vesicles over his abdomen and back. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Measles
(B): Urushiol-induced dermatitis
(C): Scarlet fever
(D): Chickenpox
(E): Rubella
",Chickenpox,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Chickenpox.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is chickenpox (varicella). Chickenpox is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is characterized by a generalized rash with macules, papules, and crusted lesions. The rash typically starts on the face and trunk and then spreads to the extremities. The presence of fluid-filled vesicles is also consistent with chickenpox.

The patient's symptoms of fever, headache, and muscle pain are also common in chickenpox. The itching and sleep disturbance are characteristic of the intense pruritus associated with the rash.

The patient's recent history of a runny nose and exposure to other children at the daycare center increases the likelihood of a viral infection. Measles, rubella, and scarlet fever are also viral infections that can cause a rash, but they have different clinical features and are less likely based on the patient's presentation.

Urushiol-induced dermatitis is a type of allergic contact dermatitis caused by exposure to plants such as poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac. It typically presents with a linear rash and is not associated with systemic symptoms like fever and headache.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is chickenpox.",

After the examination, the patient starts screaming and tries to bite the physician. Urine toxicology screening is positive for ethyl glucuronide. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Brief psychotic disorder
(B): Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(C): Anticholinergic toxicity
(D): Lysergic acid diethylamide intoxication
(E): Synthetic cathinone intoxication
",Synthetic cathinone intoxication,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Synthetic cathinone intoxication.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including unusual behavior, paranoia (""The government is following me everywhere""), dilated pupils, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, and aggression, are consistent with synthetic cathinone intoxication, also known as ""bath salts."" Synthetic cathinones are a class of amphetamine analogs that can cause severe agitation, psychosis, and delirium. They are often sold as a white powder in small packages labeled as ""bath salts,"" ""plant food,"" ""cleaners,"" or other substances. Synthetic cathinones can be ingested orally, inhaled, or injected. The use of synthetic cathinones can lead to severe cardiovascular effects, including hypertension and tachycardia, as seen in this patient. The positive urine toxicology screening for ethyl glucuronide, a metabolite of alcohol, suggests recent alcohol use, which may have contributed to the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of major depressive disorder and current use of amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, and diphenhydramine, an antihistamine with anticholinergic properties, are not consistent with the symptoms and findings in this patient. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for less than 1 month, but it is not associated with the physical findings seen in this patient. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after the administration of antipsychotic medications, but this patient is not taking any antipsychotic medications. Anticholinergic toxicity can cause delirium, but it does not typically cause the severe agitation and aggression seen in this patient. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intoxication can cause hallucinations and psychosis, but it does not typically cause the severe agitation and aggression seen in this patient.",
"A 22-year-old male presents to the emergency room complaining of neck stiffness. He reports that his neck started “locking” three hours ago. He is now unable to move it. His past medical history is notable for schizophrenia and asthma and he currently takes albuterol as well as another medication whose name he does not remember. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 18/min. On physical examination, the patient appears anxious and diaphoretic. He speaks in full sentences and is oriented to person, place, and time. The patient’s neck is flexed and rotated to the right approximately 40 degrees. The right sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are firm and contracted. Extraocular movements are full and intact. Upon further questioning, he reports that he took more medication four hours ago because he was hearing voices. Which of the following should most likely be administered to this patient?
Options:
(A): Glycopyrrolate
(B): Benztropine
(C): Levodopa
(D): Dantrolene
(E): Propranolol
",Benztropine,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Benztropine.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with acute dystonia, which is a side effect of antipsychotic medications. Acute dystonia is characterized by sustained muscle contractions, often involving the neck muscles, resulting in abnormal postures or movements. The patient's symptoms of neck stiffness and ""locking"" are indicative of acute dystonia. 

Benztropine is an anticholinergic medication that is commonly used to treat acute dystonia. It works by blocking the effects of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in muscle contractions. By blocking acetylcholine, benztropine helps to relieve the muscle spasms and stiffness associated with acute dystonia.

Glycopyrrolate (A) is also an anticholinergic medication, but it is primarily used to reduce excessive salivation and respiratory secretions. It is not the best choice for treating acute dystonia.

Levodopa (C) is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by tremors, rigidity, and bradykinesia. It is not indicated for the treatment of acute dystonia.

Dantrolene (D) is a muscle relaxant that is primarily used to treat malignant hyperthermia and spasticity. It is not the best choice for treating acute dystonia.

Propranolol (E) is a beta-blocker that is primarily used to treat hypertension, angina, and arrhythmias. It is not indicated for the treatment of acute dystonia.",
"A 13-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly. A venous blood sample obtained for routine screening tests is milky. After refrigeration, a creamy supernatant layer appears on top of the sample. Genetic analysis shows a mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2) on chromosome 19. This patient is at greatest risk for developing which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Acute pancreatitis
(B): Myocardial infarction
(C): Corneal arci
(D): Cholesterol embolization syndrome
(E): Cerebrovascular accident
",Acute pancreatitis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Acute pancreatitis.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario has a mutation in the apolipoprotein C-II gene (APOC2), which is associated with a condition called familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). FCS is characterized by the accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma, leading to milky appearance of the blood sample and the formation of a creamy supernatant layer after refrigeration.

One of the major complications of FCS is acute pancreatitis. Chylomicrons are large lipoprotein particles that transport dietary triglycerides from the intestine to various tissues. In FCS, the absence or dysfunction of apolipoprotein C-II, which is an essential cofactor for lipoprotein lipase, leads to impaired clearance of chylomicrons. This results in the accumulation of chylomicrons in the plasma, leading to increased levels of triglycerides.

Elevated triglyceride levels can cause inflammation of the pancreas, leading to acute pancreatitis. This is a recurrent complication that usually begins in childhood. Therefore, the patient in this scenario is at greatest risk for developing acute pancreatitis.

The other options are not associated with FCS or the mutation in the APOC2 gene. Myocardial infarction (B) is not a common complication of FCS. Corneal arcus (C) is a lipid deposition in the cornea that is not typically associated with FCS. Cholesterol embolization syndrome (D) is a condition in which cholesterol crystals break off from atherosclerotic plaques and cause embolization to various organs, but it is not directly related to FCS. Cerebrovascular accident (E) is not a common complication of FCS.",
"A 41-year-old man comes to the emergency department with nausea, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea for the past 2 days. His abdominal discomfort is worse shortly after meals. He has also had progressive perioral numbness and upper-extremity muscle cramping for the past 24 hours. Six months ago, he underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass to treat obesity. He underwent a total thyroidectomy to treat a Hurthle cell lesion 4 days ago. His mother died of lung cancer at age 68. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 22 years. His only current medication is a multivitamin supplement. He appears fatigued. His temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 72/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/70 mm Hg. While measuring the patient's blood pressure, the nurse observes spasm of the patient's hand. Physical examination shows a well-healing surgical wound on the neck. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation with well-healed laparoscopic incisional sites. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Na+ 138 mEq/L
K+ 4.2 mEq/L
Cl- 102 mEq/L
HCO3- 25 mEq/L
Mg2+ 1.7 mEq/L
Phosphorus 4.3 mg/dL
25-hydroxyvitamin D 20 ng/mL (N: 20-100 ng/mL)
Parathyroid hormone 115 pg/mL
Total bilirubin, serum 0.7 mg/dL
Alanine aminotransferase, serum 14 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase, serum 15 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase, serum 42 U/L
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient?""
Options:
(A): Obtain abdominal CT
(B): Observation only
(C): Begin rehydration therapy
(D): Administer calcium gluconate
(E): Supplementation with vitamin D
",Administer calcium gluconate,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Administer calcium gluconate.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia can occur after thyroidectomy due to inadvertent removal or damage to the parathyroid glands, which are responsible for regulating calcium levels. Symptoms of hypocalcemia include perioral numbness, muscle cramping, and tetany. The spasm of the patient's hand during blood pressure measurement is a classic sign of hypocalcemia known as Chvostek sign.

The most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient is to administer calcium gluconate. Calcium gluconate is a calcium supplement that can rapidly increase serum calcium levels and alleviate symptoms of hypocalcemia. It is important to address hypocalcemia promptly to prevent complications such as seizures and cardiac arrhythmias.

Obtaining an abdominal CT or ultrasound, as well as a chest x-ray, would not be the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient because the clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with hypocalcemia, not an abdominal or chest pathology.

Observation only would not be appropriate because the patient is symptomatic and at risk for complications of hypocalcemia.

Supplementation with vitamin D may be necessary in the long term to improve calcium absorption, but it would not be the most appropriate initial step in the management of this patient.

Rehydration therapy would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.",
"A 9-year-old boy is brought to a physician by his mother for evaluation of generalized weakness, increased urination, and increased thirst. The mother mentions that her boy is always tired, and seems to be getting worse. He prefers watching television rather than going out and playing with other kids. Furthermore, he has had frequent episodes of constipation since birth. Except for frequent cravings for salty foods, the boy eats a regular diet. The patient was delivered healthy and is fully immunized. The medical history is unremarkable, and he takes no medications. He has no siblings. His father is a banker and his mother is a librarian. The pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 15/min. He is in the bottom 10th percentile for height and weight according to his age. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. He recently had a urinalysis that showed elevated urinary calcium excretion.
Additional lab testing results are as follows:
Serum electrolytes
Sodium 135 mEq/L
Potassium 3.2 mEq/L
Chloride 95 mEq/L
Plasma renin activity 10 ng/mL/hr (normal, 0.5–3.3 ng/mL/hr)
Plasma aldosterone concentration 20 ng/dL (normal, 2–9 ng/dL)
What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Renal artery stenosis
(B): Primary hyperaldosteronism
(C): Bartter's syndrome
(D): Pheochromocytoma
(E): Gitelman's syndrome
",Bartter's syndrome,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Bartter's syndrome.

Bartter's syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by defects in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney. This leads to excessive salt and water loss in the urine, resulting in electrolyte imbalances and fluid depletion. 

The clinical presentation of Bartter's syndrome includes symptoms such as generalized weakness, increased urination (polyuria), increased thirst (polydipsia), fatigue, and growth retardation. The patient may also have constipation, as seen in this case. 

The laboratory findings in Bartter's syndrome typically show hypokalemia (low potassium levels), hypochloremia (low chloride levels), and metabolic alkalosis (elevated blood pH). In this case, the patient's potassium level is 3.2 mEq/L (below the normal range), and the chloride level is 95 mEq/L (below the normal range). These findings are consistent with Bartter's syndrome.

The elevated urinary calcium excretion seen in the urinalysis is also a characteristic feature of Bartter's syndrome. This is due to the increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubules, which leads to increased calcium reabsorption and subsequent urinary excretion.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Renal artery stenosis typically presents with hypertension, which is not seen in this patient. Primary hyperaldosteronism is characterized by hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis, but the patient's blood pressure is within the normal range. Pheochromocytoma is associated with paroxysmal hypertension, which is not described in this case. Gitelman's syndrome is another genetic disorder affecting the distal convoluted tubules, but it typically presents with hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and metabolic alkalosis, which are not seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and exclusion of other possibilities, the most likely diagnosis is Bartter's syndrome.",
"A 5-year-old boy of African descent is presented to the emergency department by his parents. The child is clutching his abdomen and crying about pain in his belly. His mother reports intermittent episodes of jaundice with joint and bone pain since he was 5 months old. At presentation, the patient’s vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals slight jaundice and pale conjunctiva. The spleen is tender and easily palpable. After a complete blood count with differential and an abdominal ultrasound, the patient is found to have sickle-cell disease with splenic infarct. A partial splenectomy is performed. After the operation, the physician provides vaccines against Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The picture shows a slide obtained from the resected portion of the patient’s spleen. Dysfunction of the zone marked with which number predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections?
Options:
(A): 2 only
(B): 1 only
(C): 3 only
(D): 1 and 2
(E): 1, 2, and 3
",1 and 2,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): 1 and 2.

Explanation:
In the given scenario, the patient has sickle cell disease with splenic infarct. Sickle cell disease is characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin (hemoglobin S) which causes red blood cells to become sickle-shaped and prone to hemolysis. The spleen plays an important role in filtering out damaged or abnormal red blood cells, but in sickle cell disease, repeated episodes of vaso-occlusion can lead to splenic infarction and subsequent dysfunction.

In the image provided, the zone marked with number 1 represents the red pulp of the spleen, which is responsible for filtering and removing damaged red blood cells. Dysfunction of this zone predisposes the patient to infections, particularly those caused by encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. These bacteria have polysaccharide capsules that help them evade the immune system, and the spleen normally plays a crucial role in opsonizing and removing these bacteria from circulation.

The zone marked with number 2 represents the white pulp of the spleen, which is involved in immune responses and the production of antibodies. Dysfunction of this zone also contributes to the increased susceptibility to infections, including those caused by Neisseria meningitidis, which can cause meningitis and sepsis.

Therefore, dysfunction of both the red pulp (zone 1) and white pulp (zone 2) of the spleen predisposes the patient to the aforementioned infections.",
"A 51-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician complaining of months of dry mouth and dry eyes. She says the dryness has become so severe that she has difficulty swallowing food. She has a history of hypertension, for which she takes hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), but she has no other medical problems. Family history is significant for her grandmother having systemic lupus erythematosus. The vital signs include: blood pressure 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical exam, she has tender parotid glands bilaterally and dries mucous membranes. The presence of serum anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies is confirmed at high titers. In addition to her primary diagnosis, which of the following is this patient most at risk for developing in the future?
Options:
(A): Gastric carcinoma
(B): Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(C): Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(D): Invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast
(E): Adenocarcinoma of the lung
",Non-Hodgkin lymphoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Sjögren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes and dry mouth due to lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands. The presence of serum anti-Ro and anti-La autoantibodies confirms the diagnosis. Patients with Sjögren syndrome are at an increased risk of developing lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The risk of lymphoma in patients with Sjögren syndrome is estimated to be 5-10 times higher than the general population. Therefore, this patient is most at risk for developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the future. The other options (A, C, D, and E) are not associated with Sjögren syndrome.",
"A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with fatigue, a progressively worsening cough with flecks of blood, shortness of breath, and dark urine. He reports feeling ill for the past 3 weeks. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes chlorthalidone and atorvastatin. Family history is noncontributory. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes daily for the past 26 years. Anti-glomerular basement membrane serologies are positive. Which of the following is a specific feature for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis
(B): Hypocomplementemia
(C): Positive cryoglobulins
(D): Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence
(E): Longitudinal splitting and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane
",Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Goodpasture syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies. Linear IgG staining on immunofluorescence is a specific feature of Goodpasture syndrome. This staining pattern indicates the presence of IgG antibodies along the glomerular basement membrane, which is a key finding in this condition. 

Option (A): Granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis are not specific features of Goodpasture syndrome. These findings are more commonly seen in conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) or microscopic polyangiitis.

Option (B): Hypocomplementemia is not a specific feature of Goodpasture syndrome. It is more commonly seen in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis.

Option (C): Positive cryoglobulins are not a specific feature of Goodpasture syndrome. Cryoglobulins are immune complexes that precipitate at low temperatures and can be seen in conditions such as hepatitis C infection or cryoglobulinemic vasculitis.

Option (E): Longitudinal splitting and thickening of the glomerular basement membrane are not specific features of Goodpasture syndrome. These findings are more commonly seen in conditions such as diabetic nephropathy or Alport syndrome.",
"A 32-year-old man with HIV infection is brought to the emergency department by his roommate because of a 2-week history of progressively worsening headache and vomiting. Current medications include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dolutegravir, and tenofovir-emtricitabine. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. A lumbar puncture is performed and shows an opening pressure of 32 cm H2O (N: < 20). The pathogen isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be cultured on Sabouraud agar. Further evaluation of this patient's CSF is most likely to show which of the following additional findings?
Options:
(A): Positive latex agglutination test
(B): Positive PCR for HSV-2 DNA
(C): Presence of tachyzoites
(D): Increased adenosine deaminase concentration
(E): Positive PCR for JC virus DNA
",Positive latex agglutination test,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Positive latex agglutination test.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and CSF findings, this patient is most likely suffering from cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. The pathogen isolated from the CSF can be cultured on Sabouraud agar, which is a selective medium used for the growth of fungi. Cryptococcus neoformans, the causative agent of cryptococcal meningitis, is a fungus that can be cultured on Sabouraud agar.

The additional finding that is most likely to be seen in the CSF of this patient is a positive latex agglutination test. This test is used to detect the presence of cryptococcal antigen in the CSF. A positive result indicates the presence of Cryptococcus neoformans in the CSF, confirming the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and CSF findings in this patient:
- (B) Positive PCR for HSV-2 DNA: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection typically presents with vesicular lesions and is not associated with the specific CSF findings seen in this patient.
- (C) Presence of tachyzoites: Tachyzoites are the active form of Toxoplasma gondii, which causes toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis is not associated with the specific CSF findings seen in this patient.
- (D) Increased adenosine deaminase concentration: Increased adenosine deaminase concentration in the CSF is seen in tuberculous meningitis, not cryptococcal meningitis.
- (E) Positive PCR for JC virus DNA: JC virus is associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which typically presents with focal neurological deficits. PML is not associated with the specific CSF findings seen in this patient.",
"A 70-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of back pain. For the past six days, she has had a burning pain in her upper right back and chest. She cannot recall any recent injury and has no prior history of back pain. She has a history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux. The patient volunteers at an animal shelter three times a week. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include ramipril and pantoprazole. The patient appears healthy and well nourished. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.42°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg. Examination shows a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease?
Options:
(A): Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia
(B): IgA deposits in the upper dermis
(C): Bacterial lymphatic infection of the epidermis
(D): Infestation with bloodsucking parasites
(E): Brown recluse spider envenomation
",Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Viral reactivation in dorsal root ganglia.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of a long erythematous rash covered with multiple clear vesicles and crusty lesions extending from her back to below her right breast is consistent with herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the dorsal root ganglia. 

VZV is the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia. However, in some individuals, the virus can reactivate later in life, leading to the development of herpes zoster. 

The burning pain experienced by the patient is a characteristic symptom of herpes zoster. The rash typically follows a dermatomal distribution, which means it is localized to the area supplied by a single sensory nerve. In this case, the rash extends from the patient's back to below her right breast, indicating involvement of the T4 dermatome. 

The presence of clear vesicles and crusty lesions is also consistent with herpes zoster. The vesicles contain infectious viral particles and can be easily ruptured, leading to the formation of crusts. 

The patient's history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux, as well as her current medications (ramipril and pantoprazole), are not directly related to the development of herpes zoster. 

Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of the disease in this patient is viral reactivation in the dorsal root ganglia.",
"A type of fatal adrenal cancer has an average survival rate of 3 years after the onset of clinically significant symptoms. It is determined that patients have a 4-year asymptomatic period prior to developing clinical symptoms from this adrenal cancer. A new screening test is developed, and the cancer can now be detected 2 years prior to developing clinical symptoms. A new observational case-control study of screened and unscreened patients measures the median 5-year survival of patients who decline medical and surgical treatment. The screened population has statistically better outcomes. Which step should be undertaken to prevent bias in these conclusions?
Options:
(A): Using survival rates in the analysis
(B): Using mortality rates in the analysis
(C): Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis
(D): Increasing the number of screened individuals
(E): Decreasing the number of screened individuals
",Using mortality rates in the analysis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): Using mortality rates in the analysis.

Explanation:
Using mortality rates in the analysis is the appropriate step to prevent bias in these conclusions. This is because comparing survival rates between screened and unscreened groups can introduce lead time bias and length time bias. 

Lead time bias occurs when screening detects a disease earlier than it would have been diagnosed clinically, leading to the perception that patients live longer after diagnosis simply because the date of diagnosis is moved earlier, not because the date of death is delayed. This can artificially improve survival rates.

Length time bias occurs because screening is more likely to detect slowly progressive diseases rather than rapidly progressive ones. Therefore, a screened population may have a higher proportion of slowly progressive cases, leading to the appearance of better disease survival compared to an unscreened population.

By using mortality rates, which measure the number of deaths divided by the number of people at risk, these biases can be avoided. Mortality rates provide a more accurate assessment of the impact of screening on disease outcomes, as they focus on the actual number of deaths rather than the time of survival.

Analyzing the results by age of diagnosis (option C) may provide additional insights, but it does not directly address the issue of bias in the conclusions. Increasing or decreasing the number of screened individuals (options D and E) would not address the bias caused by lead time and length time biases. Using survival rates in the analysis (option A) would perpetuate the bias caused by lead time and length time biases.",
"A 60-year-old man presents to the office for shortness of breath. The shortness of breath started a year ago and is exacerbated by physical activity. He has been working in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years. His vital signs include: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 30/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. On physical exam, there are diminished respiratory sounds on both sides. On the chest radiograph, interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate is found on both sides, and there is also an eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Berylliosis
(B): Silicosis
(C): Asbestosis
(D): Talcosis
(E): Byssinosis
",Silicosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Silicosis.

Explanation:
Silicosis is a lung disease caused by inhalation of crystalline silica dust. It commonly affects individuals who work in occupations such as mining, construction, and glass manufacturing, where they are exposed to silica dust. In this case, the patient has a history of working in the glass manufacturing industry for 20 years, which puts him at risk for developing silicosis.

The presentation of shortness of breath that started a year ago and is exacerbated by physical activity is consistent with the symptoms of silicosis. The diminished respiratory sounds on both sides and the findings on the chest radiograph, including interstitial fibrosis with reticulonodular infiltrate and eggshell calcification of multiple adenopathies, are also characteristic of silicosis.

Berylliosis is a lung disease caused by exposure to beryllium, which is not mentioned in the patient's history or presentation. Asbestosis is caused by exposure to asbestos fibers, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Talcosis is caused by inhalation of talc particles, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Byssinosis is caused by exposure to cotton dust, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is silicosis.",
"A 43-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her brother for severe chest pain. The patient recently lost her husband in a car accident and is still extremely shocked by the event. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 105/67 mm Hg, the heart rate is 96/min and regular, breathing rate is 23/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. An S3 heart sound and rales in the lower right and left lung lobes are heard. A 12-lead ECG shows no significant findings. Echocardiography shows an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium. The patient is stabilized and informed about the diagnosis and possible treatment options. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Aortic stenosis
(B): Atrial fibrillation
(C): Constrictive pericarditis
(D): Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
(E): Restrictive cardiomyopathy
",Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Explanation:
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy or ""broken heart syndrome,"" is the most likely diagnosis in this case. This condition is characterized by sudden and temporary weakening of the heart muscle, typically triggered by severe emotional or physical stress. The patient's recent loss of her husband in a car accident and her extreme shock are consistent with the emotional stress that can precipitate Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

The physical examination findings, such as an S3 heart sound and rales in the lower lung lobes, are also consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. An S3 heart sound is often heard in patients with acute heart failure, which can occur in Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Rales in the lungs indicate fluid accumulation, which is another common feature of heart failure.

The normal 12-lead ECG findings are also typical of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Unlike other forms of cardiomyopathy, such as aortic stenosis, atrial fibrillation, or restrictive cardiomyopathy, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy does not typically show significant abnormalities on the ECG.

Finally, the echocardiography findings of an enlarged left ventricle and left atrium are consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. This condition often presents with transient left ventricular dysfunction and dilation, which can be visualized on echocardiography.

Overall, the combination of the patient's clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and imaging results strongly suggests Takotsubo cardiomyopathy as the most likely diagnosis in this case.",
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department. He was found unconscious on the street. The staff recognizes him as a local homeless man with a long history of alcoholism. At the hospital, his pulse is 95/min, the blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the respirations are 20/min, and the oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the unconscious man is covered in bloody vomit with small clots and food particles. He smells of alcohol. A digital exam reveals black tarry stool in the rectal vault. The patient is given oxygen, IV fluids, and an NG-tube is placed and set to intermittent suction. Labs are sent and the patient is prepared for a procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?
Options:
(A): Undergo colonoscopy
(B): Undergo upper GI endoscopy
(C): Selective mesenteric angiography
(D): Proton pump inhibitors with anti-H.pylori regimen
(E): Surgery for peptic ulcer disease
",Undergo upper GI endoscopy,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Undergo upper GI endoscopy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of bloody vomit with small clots and food particles, along with black tarry stool on digital rectal exam, the most likely cause of his symptoms is an upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed. Upper GI bleeding refers to bleeding that occurs in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. It is important to identify the source of the bleeding in order to guide further management.

Upper GI endoscopy is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Upper GI endoscopy allows direct visualization of the upper GI tract and can identify the source of bleeding, such as esophageal varices, peptic ulcers, or gastritis. It also allows for therapeutic interventions, such as cauterization or injection of epinephrine, to stop the bleeding.

Colonoscopy (option A) is not indicated in this patient as the source of bleeding is likely in the upper GI tract, based on the presentation.

Selective mesenteric angiography (option C) may be considered if the bleeding source is not identified on upper GI endoscopy or if there is suspicion for a lower GI bleed. However, in this patient with a history of alcoholism and signs of upper GI bleeding, upper GI endoscopy is the initial procedure of choice.

Proton pump inhibitors with anti-H.pylori regimen (option D) may be used in the management of peptic ulcer disease, but the next step in this patient's management is to identify the source of bleeding through upper GI endoscopy.

Surgery for peptic ulcer disease (option E) may be considered in cases of refractory bleeding or complications such as perforation or obstruction. However, the initial step in management is to perform upper GI endoscopy to identify the source of bleeding.",
"An 8-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of hematuria. Two weeks ago, she had a sore throat that resolved without treatment. Physical examination shows 1+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Urinalysis shows numerous RBCs and 3+ proteinuria. Her antistreptolysin O titer is elevated. Formation of which of the following is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Antigen-specific IgE binding to mast cells
(B): Tissue-specific antibodies
(C): Presensitized CD4+ helper T-cells
(D): Antigen-antibody complexes
(E): Presensitized CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells
",Antigen-antibody complexes,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Antigen-antibody complexes.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms are consistent with post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is an immune-mediated kidney disease that occurs after a streptococcal infection, such as a sore throat. The elevated antistreptolysin O titer indicates a recent streptococcal infection. In post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, the immune response to the streptococcal infection leads to the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, which deposit in the glomeruli of the kidneys. These immune complexes activate the complement system and cause inflammation and damage to the glomerular basement membrane, leading to hematuria and proteinuria. The pitting edema seen in this patient is due to the loss of protein in the urine. Therefore, the formation of antigen-antibody complexes is most likely involved in the underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms.",
"A 25-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was found down in the middle of the street. His past medical history is unknown. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 104/64 mmHg, pulse is 70/min, respirations are 5/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. The patient is being resuscitated in the trauma bay. Which of the following was most likely to be found on exam?
Options:
(A): Ataxia
(B): Conjunctival injection
(C): Miosis
(D): Mydriasis
(E): Nystagmus
",Miosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Miosis.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with altered mental status, which can be indicative of a drug overdose or intoxication. The vital signs provided show a low respiratory rate of 5/min and a low oxygen saturation of 91%, suggesting respiratory depression. These findings, along with the altered mental status, are consistent with opioid overdose.

Miosis, or constriction of the pupils, is a classic sign of opioid intoxication. Opioids, such as heroin or prescription pain medications, can cause the pupils to constrict due to their effects on the central nervous system. This is in contrast to mydriasis, or dilation of the pupils, which is commonly seen with sympathomimetic drug intoxication, such as cocaine or amphetamines.

Ataxia, or uncoordinated movements, conjunctival injection, or redness of the conjunctiva, and nystagmus, or involuntary eye movements, are not typically associated with opioid intoxication. These findings are more commonly seen with alcohol intoxication or other central nervous system depressants.

Therefore, the most likely finding on exam in this patient with altered mental status and respiratory depression is miosis.",
"A 38-year-old G4P3 presents to her obstetrician’s office for her 20-week anatomy ultrasound. She reports that she feels well and has not experienced any contractions or vaginal bleeding. She also reports good fetal movement. The patient declined prenatal screening earlier in the pregnancy for religious reasons but would now like an anatomy ultrasound to ensure the fetus is growing appropriately. The patient’s previous pregnancies were uncomplicated, and she delivered three healthy babies at full term. On the ultrasound, the technician observes a male fetus with likely intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). She also notes microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, and clenched fists with overlapping fingers. The technician further notes a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD). The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is 26 cm.

Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be observed in this fetus?
Options:
(A): Cleft palate
(B): Epicanthal folds
(C): Micropthlamia
(D): Prominent occiput
(E): Webbed neck
",Prominent occiput,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Prominent occiput.

Explanation:
The presence of microcephaly, convex-rounded feet, clenched fists with overlapping fingers, and a medium-sized ventricular septal defect (VSD) are all characteristic findings of trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome. Trisomy 18 is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 18. 

One of the common physical features seen in trisomy 18 is a prominent occiput, which refers to an abnormally large or protruding back of the head. This finding is often seen in conjunction with microcephaly, which is a condition characterized by a smaller than normal head size. 

Cleft palate (option A), epicanthal folds (option B), micropthlamia (option C), and webbed neck (option E) are not typically associated with trisomy 18. Cleft palate is more commonly seen in trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), while epicanthal folds are often seen in Down syndrome (trisomy 21). Micropthlamia refers to abnormally small eyes, which is not a characteristic finding in trisomy 18. Webbed neck is associated with Turner syndrome, which is caused by a missing or partially missing X chromosome in females.",
"An 83-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, weakness, and decreased responsiveness. He is diagnosed with urosepsis based on urinalysis and culture and started on ceftriaxone and intravenous fluids. By hospital day 3, he is clinically improving. During the evening, the patient becomes irritable. He is talking to someone despite nobody being present in the room. He is easily agitated and attempts to strike a nurse with a remote control to his TV. Subsequently, the patient keeps getting out of bed and trying to walk away despite being a fall risk. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Diphenhydramine
(B): Lorazepam
(C): Olanzapine
(D): Phenobarbital
(E): Physical restraints
",Olanzapine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Olanzapine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of irritability, agitation, hallucinations, and aggression are suggestive of delirium, which is a common complication in elderly patients with infections, especially urosepsis. Delirium is characterized by acute onset of fluctuating mental status, inattention, and disorganized thinking. It is important to manage delirium promptly to ensure patient safety and prevent harm to themselves or others.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer an antipsychotic medication, such as olanzapine. Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that has been shown to be effective in managing the symptoms of delirium. It has a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics, making it a safer choice in elderly patients.

Diphenhydramine (choice A) is an antihistamine with sedating properties. While it may help with sleep, it is not the most appropriate choice for managing the symptoms of delirium.

Lorazepam (choice B) is a benzodiazepine that has sedating properties. It may be used to manage agitation in certain situations, but it is not the most appropriate choice for managing delirium.

Phenobarbital (choice D) is a barbiturate that has sedating properties. It may be used to manage seizures, but it is not the most appropriate choice for managing delirium.

Physical restraints (choice E) should be avoided whenever possible as they can increase agitation and the risk of injury. Restraints should only be used as a last resort when all other measures have failed and there is an immediate risk of harm to the patient or others.",
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, weight loss, and muscle aches during the past 2 months. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. Her only medication is a multivitamin. A metyrapone stimulation test is performed and the results rule out a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Which of the following changes in laboratory findings are most likely to have been observed in this patient following the administration of the drug?
Options:
(A): Increase in serum ACTH
(B): Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids
(C): Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol
(D): Increase in serum cortisol
(E): Increase in urine metanephrines
",Increase in serum ACTH,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Increase in serum ACTH.

Explanation:
The metyrapone stimulation test is used to evaluate the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Metyrapone inhibits the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, leading to a decrease in serum cortisol concentrations. In response to this decrease, there is an increase in corticotropin (ACTH) secretion from the pituitary gland. Therefore, following the administration of metyrapone, the most likely change in laboratory findings would be an increase in serum ACTH levels.

Option (B) Decrease in urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids is not the correct answer because the metyrapone stimulation test primarily affects cortisol production, not 17-hydroxycorticosteroids.

Option (C) Decrease in serum 11-deoxycortisol is not the correct answer because metyrapone inhibits the conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, leading to an increase in serum 11-deoxycortisol levels.

Option (D) Increase in serum cortisol is not the correct answer because metyrapone inhibits cortisol production, leading to a decrease in serum cortisol levels.

Option (E) Increase in urine metanephrines is not the correct answer because metyrapone does not directly affect the production of metanephrines, which are metabolites of catecholamines.",
"An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain. The other subset of study participants was diagnosed with GBM only after they developed symptoms. Results from the study show that the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. Which of the following statistical biases is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study?
Options:
(A): Observer-expectancy bias
(B): Length-time bias
(C): Confounding bias
(D): Surveillance bias
(E): Lead-time bias
",Lead-time bias,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Lead-time bias.

Explanation:
Lead-time bias occurs when a screening test detects a disease earlier than it would have been diagnosed clinically. In this study, the asymptomatic patients were diagnosed with GBM through a screening MRI, which allowed for earlier detection compared to the patients who were diagnosed after developing symptoms. As a result, the average survival time for the asymptomatic patients appears longer simply because the date of diagnosis was moved earlier, not because the patients actually lived longer. This bias creates the perception of increased survival time when there is no actual effect.

Observer-expectancy bias (A) occurs when the expectations or beliefs of the investigator influence the outcome of the study. This bias is unlikely to have occurred in this study as the results are based on objective measurements (survival time) rather than subjective assessments.

Length-time bias (B) occurs when a screening test detects slowly progressive diseases more readily than rapidly progressive diseases. This bias leads to an overrepresentation of slowly progressive cases in the screened population, making it appear that the disease has better survival than it actually does. However, in this study, the focus is on survival time, not disease progression, so length-time bias is not the most likely bias.

Confounding bias (C) occurs when there is a factor that is associated with both the exposure and the outcome, leading to a distortion of the relationship between the two. There is no mention of any confounding factors in the given information, so this bias is less likely to have occurred.

Surveillance bias (D) occurs when the intensity of surveillance or follow-up differs between groups, leading to differences in the detection of outcomes. In this study, both groups of patients were being monitored for GBM, so surveillance bias is not the most likely bias.

Therefore, the most likely bias that occurred in this study is lead-time bias (E).",
"A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which he was the restrained driver. On questioning by the paramedics, he reported severe chest pain and mild dyspnea. On arrival, he is confused and unable to provide a history. His pulse is 93/min, respirations are 28/min, and blood pressure is 91/65 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. He is able to move his extremities in response to commands. He opens his eyes spontaneously. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Examination shows multiple bruises over the trunk and extremities. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) wound at the left fifth intercostal space at the midclavicular line. There is jugular venous distention. Decreased breath sounds and hyperresonance on percussion are noted on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): CT scan of the chest
(B): Bronchoscopy
(C): Emergency thoracotomy
(D): Needle decompression
(E): X-ray of the chest
""
",Needle decompression,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Needle decompression.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is tension pneumothorax. Tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased pressure on the affected lung and mediastinal shift. This can result in decreased cardiac output and impaired ventilation.

The patient's symptoms of severe chest pain, dyspnea, and decreased breath sounds on the left side, along with hyperresonance on percussion, are consistent with tension pneumothorax. The presence of jugular venous distention suggests increased intrathoracic pressure.

The most appropriate next step in management is needle decompression. This procedure involves inserting a large-bore needle into the affected pleural space to release the trapped air and relieve the pressure. Needle decompression is a life-saving procedure that should be performed immediately in patients with suspected tension pneumothorax.

CT scan of the chest (A) may provide more detailed information about the extent of the injury but is not the most appropriate initial step in management of a tension pneumothorax.

Bronchoscopy (B) is not indicated in the management of tension pneumothorax. Bronchoscopy is a procedure used to visualize the airways and is not necessary in this case.

Emergency thoracotomy (C) is a surgical procedure that involves opening the chest to directly access and repair the injured structures. While it may be necessary in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate initial step in management of a tension pneumothorax.

X-ray of the chest (E) may show findings consistent with a pneumothorax, but it does not provide immediate relief of the increased intrathoracic pressure associated with tension pneumothorax. Needle decompression should be performed first to stabilize the patient.",
"A novel type of PET radiotracer is being developed to evaluate patients with Parkinson’s disease. A clinical research study has enrolled 1,200 patients, half of whom have the disease. The scan is found to be positive in 590 of the 600 patients with known PD, and positive in 20 of the 600 patients without PD. What is the test’s overall specificity?
Options:
(A): 580 / (20 + 590)
(B): 580 / (10 + 580)
(C): 590 / (590 + 20)
(D): 590 / (590 + 10)
(E): 580 / (580 + 20)
",580 / (580 + 20),Correct,"The correct answer is (E): 580 / (580 + 20).

Explanation:
Specificity is defined as the proportion of true negatives among all individuals without the disease. In this case, the true negatives are the patients without Parkinson's disease who have a negative scan result.

According to the information given, there are 600 patients without PD, and the scan is positive in 20 of them. Therefore, the number of true negatives is 600 - 20 = 580.

The formula for specificity is: Specificity = True Negatives / (True Negatives + False Positives)

In this case, the number of true negatives is 580, and the number of false positives (patients without PD who have a positive scan result) is 0 (since there are no false positives mentioned in the information given).

Therefore, the specificity is 580 / (580 + 0) = 580 / 580 = 1.

So, the test's overall specificity is 1, or 100%.",
"A 55-year-old man presents to a rheumatologist with bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years. The patient was a professional athlete who retired at age 50. He also notes morning stiffness in his joints that lasts approx. 50 minutes. He denies joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills. On physical exam, the physician notes several non-tender nodules on the left 1st, 3rd, and 4th distal interphalangeal joints. There is also tenderness with palpation at the base of both thumbs. The patient’s knees are enlarged, bilaterally, and he has pain and crepitus on passive range of motion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Ankylosing spondylitis
(B): Rheumatoid arthritis
(C): Gout
(D): Osteoarthritis
(E): Fibromyalgia
",Osteoarthritis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Osteoarthritis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees and hips. It is more common in older individuals and those with a history of joint overuse or injury, such as professional athletes. The patient's bilateral wrist and knee pain that has been present for the last 10 years is consistent with the chronic nature of osteoarthritis.

The presence of morning stiffness lasting approximately 50 minutes is also characteristic of osteoarthritis. This stiffness typically improves with movement and is a result of joint inflammation and fluid accumulation during periods of inactivity.

The physical exam findings of non-tender nodules on the distal interphalangeal joints and tenderness at the base of both thumbs are known as Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes, respectively. These nodules are commonly seen in osteoarthritis and are a result of osteophyte formation.

The patient's denial of joint swelling, color changes in his digits, dryness of mucous membranes, and constitutional symptoms such as fever and chills makes other diagnoses such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and ankylosing spondylitis less likely.

Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with symmetric joint involvement, morning stiffness lasting longer than 1 hour, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue and weight loss. Gout is characterized by sudden onset of severe joint pain, redness, and swelling, often affecting the big toe. Ankylosing spondylitis primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints, leading to back pain and stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with exercise.

Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. It does not typically present with joint swelling or nodules.",
"A 40-year-old businessman who was previously well is brought into the emergency department by his assistant with a complaint of left-sided weakness after a chiropractic neck manipulation. He has never felt like this before. Past medical history is insignificant. His blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, pulse 86/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F). A T2-weighted MRI shows a left C5 hemicord lesion. The patient is treated with cervical immobilization, a course of steroids, and physical therapy. What other finding will most likely be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Spastic paralysis at the level of lesion
(B): Right-sided Horner's syndrome
(C): Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement
(D): Right-sided analgesia
(E): Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception
",Right-sided analgesia,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Right-sided analgesia.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with left-sided weakness and a left C5 hemicord lesion suggests a spinal cord injury. In this case, the lesion is located on the left side of the spinal cord at the level of C5. 

The spinal cord carries sensory information from the body to the brain, and motor commands from the brain to the body. In this patient, the left-sided weakness indicates motor involvement due to the lesion. 

The most likely finding associated with this type of spinal cord injury is right-sided analgesia, or loss of pain sensation on the right side of the body. This is because the sensory fibers that carry pain information from the body to the brain cross over to the opposite side of the spinal cord shortly after entering. Therefore, a lesion on the left side of the spinal cord at the level of C5 would affect the pain sensation on the right side of the body.

The other options are not consistent with the presentation and location of the lesion. Spastic paralysis at the level of the lesion would result in weakness and increased muscle tone on the same side as the lesion, not the opposite side. Right-sided Horner's syndrome is caused by interruption of sympathetic innervation to the face, resulting in ptosis (drooping of the eyelid), miosis (constriction of the pupil), and anhidrosis (decreased sweating) on the affected side. Contralateral corticospinal tract involvement would result in weakness on the opposite side of the body, not the same side. Contralateral loss of vibration and proprioception would also result from involvement of the dorsal columns, which are located on the same side as the lesion.",
"A previously healthy 19-year-old man comes to the physician with right-sided, dull, throbbing scrotal pain for 12 hours. He has also had a burning sensation on urination and increased urinary frequency for the past 3 days. He has not had urethral discharge. He is sexually active with one female partner and does not use condoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a tender right testicle; lifting it provides relief. The penis appears normal, with no discharge at the meatus. Laboratory studies show a normal complete blood count; urinalysis shows 3 WBC/hpf. A Gram stain of a urethral swab shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no organisms. Testicular ultrasound shows increased blood flow to the right testicle compared to the left. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection
(B): Testicular tumor
(C): Treponema pallidum infection
(D): Chlamydia trachomatis infection
(E): Varicocele
",Chlamydia trachomatis infection,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Chlamydia trachomatis infection.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms, including scrotal pain, burning sensation on urination, increased urinary frequency, and presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes on Gram stain, are consistent with epididymitis. Epididymitis is inflammation of the epididymis, which is commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

The patient's sexual activity with one female partner and lack of condom use increase the likelihood of an STI. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of epididymitis in young sexually active men. The absence of urethral discharge and normal physical examination findings of the penis and meatus make Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection less likely.

Testicular torsion (choice F) typically presents with sudden-onset severe testicular pain, absent cremasteric reflex, and a high-riding testicle. This patient's pain is more consistent with epididymitis, and lifting the testicle provides relief, which is not seen in testicular torsion.

Testicular tumor (choice B) is less likely given the acute onset of symptoms and the presence of urinary symptoms and leukocytosis.

Treponema pallidum infection (choice C) is associated with syphilis, which typically presents with painless genital ulcers (chancre) and systemic symptoms such as rash and lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with syphilis.

Varicocele (choice E) is a dilation of the pampiniform plexus of veins in the scrotum and is typically asymptomatic or associated with a dull ache or dragging sensation. It is not associated with urinary symptoms or leukocytosis.",
"A 4-month-old infant is brought to the office by his parents due to sudden nose bleeding without trauma of any kind. He has a 1-month history of multiple bruising that measures 1 cm in diameter each in the hands and feet, and tiny red spots that appeared in the upper and lower extremities without any trauma either. He has no prior bleeding history nor any relevant family history. The vital signs include: heart rate 190/min, respiratory rate 40/min, blood pressure 99/42 mm Hg, and temperature 36.6 °C (97.9 °F). His physical exam shows pale skin color, petechiae in the soft palate and in the upper and lower extremities as well as ecchymosis in the back of the hands and feet.
The complete blood count results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 8.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 41%
Leukocyte count 10,500/mm3
Neutrophils 53%
Bands 2%
Eosinophils 1%
Basophils 0%
Lymphocytes 33%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 450,000/mm3
The coagulation test results are as follows:
Partial thromboplastin time (activated) 30.0 sec
Prothrombin time 13.6 sec
International normalized ratio 0.99
Fibrinogen 364.9 mg/dL
The blood smear shows hypochromia, poikilocytosis, and large platelets, while a platelet aggregation test with ristocetin is normal. The overall bleeding time is increased. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Von Willebrand disease
(B): Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia
(C): Aspirin
(D): Bernard-Soulier disease
(E): Scurvy
",Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia, which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets. This receptor is responsible for platelet aggregation by binding to fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor. Patients with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia typically present with mucocutaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis (nosebleeds), easy bruising, and petechiae. The absence of a family history of bleeding suggests a new mutation in this patient. The physical exam findings of pale skin color, petechiae, and ecchymosis are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The laboratory findings of normal platelet count, increased bleeding time, and normal platelet aggregation test with ristocetin are also consistent with Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia. The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation or laboratory findings. Von Willebrand disease is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor, resulting in impaired platelet adhesion. Aspirin inhibits platelet aggregation by irreversibly inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1, leading to decreased production of thromboxane A2. Bernard-Soulier disease is characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of the glycoprotein Ib/IX/V receptor on platelets, resulting in impaired platelet adhesion. Scurvy is caused by vitamin C deficiency and is characterized by impaired collagen synthesis, leading to fragile blood vessels and easy bruising.",
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Vital signs are within normal limits. Urinalysis shows cloudy, red urine. This patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with a virus with which of the following features?
Options:
(A): Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded DNA
(B): Non-enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA
(C): Enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA
(D): Enveloped with linear, single-stranded RNA
(E): Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA
","Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA",Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Non-enveloped with linear, double-stranded DNA.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this patient, including dysuria, increased urinary frequency, and cloudy, red urine, is consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs in children are commonly caused by bacteria, but in rare cases, they can be caused by viruses. Adenovirus is one such virus that can cause cystitis, which is inflammation of the bladder.

Adenovirus is a non-enveloped virus, meaning it does not have a lipid envelope surrounding its genetic material. It has linear, double-stranded DNA as its genetic material. This is in contrast to options A, B, C, and D, which describe viruses with different features.

The clinical features of adenovirus cystitis include an acute onset of dysuria and frequency, followed by hematuria (blood in the urine) 12 to 24 hours later. It is worth noting that upper respiratory tract infection may precede urinary symptoms in cases of adenovirus infection.

Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's clinical presentation is an infection with a non-enveloped virus with linear, double-stranded DNA, which is consistent with adenovirus cystitis.",
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to a left breast lump under his nipple. He noticed it last month and felt that it has increased slightly in size. It is tender to touch but has no overlying skin changes. There is no breast discharge. The patient has cryptorchidism as an infant and underwent a successful orchiopexy. In addition, he was recently diagnosed with ADHD and is currently on methylphenidate with improvement in his symptoms. He has a family history of type I diabetes in his father and breast fibroadenoma in his mother. On exam, the patient is at the 82nd percentile for height, 79th percentile for weight, and 80th percentile for BMI. He has tanner IV pubic hair. Testicular volume is 7 mL on each side, and both testes are smooth and freely mobile. Breast exam shows a normal right breast and a 3-centimeter round, firm, and slightly tender discrete mass under the left nipple. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Klinefelter syndrome
(B): Glandular tissue enlargement
(C): Lipomastia (pseudogynecomastia)
(D): Testicular cancer
(E): Medication side effect
",Glandular tissue enlargement,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Glandular tissue enlargement.

Explanation:
Glandular tissue enlargement, also known as gynecomastia, is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition. Gynecomastia is a benign condition characterized by the enlargement of breast tissue in males. It is commonly seen during puberty due to hormonal imbalances, but can also occur in infants, older adults, and individuals taking certain medications.

In this case, the patient is a 13-year-old boy who is in Tanner stage IV of pubic hair development, which is consistent with the onset of puberty. The breast lump is firm, slightly tender, and located under the left nipple, which is typical for gynecomastia. There are no overlying skin changes or breast discharge, which would be concerning for breast carcinoma.

The patient's history of cryptorchidism and successful orchiopexy is not directly related to gynecomastia. However, it is important to note that certain conditions associated with hormonal imbalances, such as Klinefelter syndrome, can increase the risk of gynecomastia. In this case, there are no other clinical findings suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome, such as small, firm testes.

The patient's family history of breast fibroadenoma in his mother is not directly related to his condition. Breast fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors that are more common in females.

The patient's recent diagnosis of ADHD and use of methylphenidate is not a known cause of gynecomastia. However, it is important to consider medication side effects as a potential cause of gynecomastia in general. In this case, there is no evidence to suggest that methylphenidate is the cause of the patient's breast lump.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and absence of other concerning findings, glandular tissue enlargement (gynecomastia) is the most likely etiology of this patient's condition.",
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the emergency room with unilateral leg swelling. She reports that she developed painful left-sided leg swelling and redness earlier in the day. She is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. She denies any recent prolonged travel. She experienced a similar episode affecting the opposite leg one year ago and was diagnosed with a thrombus in the right femoral vein. On examination, the left leg is erythematous and swollen. Passive dorsiflexion of the left ankle elicits pain in the left calf. Ultrasound of the leg reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. A genetic workup reveals that she has an inherited condition. What is the most likely pathophysiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Elevated serum homocysteine
(B): Thrombin inhibitor deficiency
(C): Deficiency in protein C
(D): Auto-antibodies directed against phospholipids
(E): Resistance to clotting factor degradation
",Resistance to clotting factor degradation,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Resistance to clotting factor degradation.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is characterized by unilateral leg swelling, redness, and pain. The fact that she has a history of a previous thrombus in the opposite leg suggests a predisposition to thrombosis. The most likely pathophysiology in this case is resistance to clotting factor degradation.

Resistance to clotting factor degradation is commonly seen in patients with a genetic mutation in the factor V gene, known as factor V Leiden mutation. This mutation leads to the production of a factor V protein that is resistant to degradation by activated protein C, which is an important natural anticoagulant. As a result, there is an increased risk of thrombosis.

The patient's symptoms, history of previous thrombosis, and the presence of an inherited condition all point towards resistance to clotting factor degradation as the most likely cause of her condition. This can be confirmed by genetic testing for the factor V Leiden mutation.",
"A 78-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 5 weeks. He had been living independently but came to live with his daughter temporarily after he complained that he was unable to perform some of his daily activities. He has left the front door wide open and tap water running on multiple occasions. He does not sleep well and wakes up 6–7 times during the night. He does not leave his room and rarely makes conversation with his daughter. He says that he used to enjoy playing the piano but has not played for several months. He has hypertension treated with amlodipine. Vital signs are within normal limits. Mental status examination shows orientation to person, place, and time and psychomotor retardation. He has a blunted affect. Short- and long-term memory is impaired. Attention and concentration are impaired. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Serum concentration of electrolytes, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and vitamin B12 are within the reference range. He is very concerned about his memory lapses. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Donepezil
(B): Fluoxetine
(C): Aspirin
(D): Ventriculoperitoneal shunt
(E): Memantine
",Fluoxetine,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (A) Donepezil.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Alzheimer's disease, which is a common cause of progressive memory loss and cognitive decline in older adults. The patient's increasing forgetfulness, impaired short- and long-term memory, impaired attention and concentration, and psychomotor retardation are consistent with the cognitive and behavioral symptoms seen in Alzheimer's disease.

Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is commonly used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It works by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the brain, which can help improve cognitive function and slow down the progression of symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient based on his symptoms and the likely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Fluoxetine (Choice B) is an antidepressant medication that is not indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While depression can coexist with Alzheimer's disease, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with cognitive decline rather than primary depressive symptoms.

Aspirin (Choice C) is a medication commonly used for its antiplatelet effects in the prevention of cardiovascular events. It is not indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (Choice D) is a surgical procedure used to treat hydrocephalus, which is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain. It is not indicated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Memantine (Choice E) is another medication used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, it is typically reserved for moderate to severe cases and is not the most appropriate initial treatment option for this patient with mild to moderate symptoms. Donepezil is generally preferred as the initial treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.",
"A previously healthy 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for evaluation of an abdominal mass noticed a few days ago. He appears markedly pale and lethargic. Examination shows a 6-cm, nonmobile mass in the left upper quadrant that crosses the midline. 24-hour urine collection shows elevated homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid. Further evaluation including biopsy confirms the diagnosis of intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. The physician recommends the established standard treatment, which is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. After a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment, and the prognosis without it, the patient's parents steadily refuse chemotherapy because they do not want their son to suffer the side effects. They prefer to take their son home for supportive care only. Which of the following is the most appropriate action by the physician?
Options:
(A): Help the parents to arrange supportive care at home
(B): Refer the patient to another oncologist
(C): Recommend for parents to take 2 weeks to think about decision
(D): Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy
(E): Attempt surgical resection of the tumor
",Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Seek a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the physician has thoroughly discussed the risks and benefits of chemotherapy with the parents and explained the likelihood of unresectability without neoadjuvant treatment. The established standard treatment for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma is initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection, if possible. The parents' refusal of chemotherapy puts the child at risk of not receiving the appropriate treatment and potentially compromising their prognosis.

Seeking a court order for neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the most appropriate action by the physician in this situation. This is because the child's parents are refusing a recommended treatment that is necessary for the child's well-being. By seeking a court order, the physician can involve legal authorities to ensure that the child receives the necessary treatment.

Helping the parents to arrange supportive care at home (option A) is not appropriate in this case because it does not address the need for neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which is the standard treatment for intermediate-risk neuroblastoma.

Referring the patient to another oncologist (option B) may not be necessary at this point, as the physician has already thoroughly discussed the treatment options with the parents. Seeking a court order would be a more appropriate course of action.

Recommending for the parents to take 2 weeks to think about the decision (option C) may delay the child's treatment and potentially worsen their prognosis. The physician has already discussed the risks and benefits of chemotherapy, and further delay in treatment may not be in the best interest of the child.

Attempting surgical resection of the tumor (option E) without neoadjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended in this case. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is necessary to shrink the tumor and improve the chances of successful surgical resection. Without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the tumor may be unresectable, and the child's prognosis may be compromised.",
"A laboratory primarily involved with studying cellular proofreading mechanisms is investigating the question of whether the ribosome can recognize a mischarged amino acid and still be incorporated into the growing peptide. In order to do so, they biochemically charge a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and insert the tRNA into the cell. They design an mRNA sequence that contains only codons for lysine. Which of the following will most likely occur?
Options:
(A): The ribosome will recognize the mischarged tRNA and prevent its incorporation by removing the valine
(B): The ribosome will recognize the inappropriately inserted valine residue and terminate protein translation
(C): The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine
(D): The mischarged tRNA will be degraded by the proteasome
(E): The mischarged tRNA will be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase
",The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specificy for lysine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): The mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine.

Explanation:
During translation, the ribosome reads the mRNA codons and matches them with the appropriate tRNA anticodons, which carry specific amino acids. In this scenario, the laboratory has biochemically charged a Lys-tRNA with valine instead of lysine and inserted it into the cell. The mRNA sequence contains only codons for lysine.

When the ribosome encounters a codon for lysine, it will recognize the mischarged tRNA with valine due to the complementary base pairing between the anticodon of the tRNA and the codon of the mRNA. The ribosome will then incorporate the mischarged tRNA with valine into the growing peptide chain, even though it is not the correct amino acid for that codon.

This is because the ribosome does not have proofreading mechanisms to check the accuracy of the amino acid attached to the tRNA. It relies solely on the base pairing between the anticodon and the codon to determine which amino acid to incorporate. Therefore, the mischarged tRNA with valine will be incorporated in the codons that specify for lysine.

Option (A) is incorrect because the ribosome does not have the ability to recognize and remove a mischarged tRNA. Option (B) is incorrect because the ribosome does not terminate protein translation based on the presence of an inappropriately inserted amino acid. Option (D) is incorrect because the mischarged tRNA will not be degraded by the proteasome. Option (E) is incorrect because the mischarged tRNA will not be removed by the lysyl-tRNA synthetase.",
"A 65-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer has been experiencing severe, unremitting pain. He has required escalating doses of oral morphine, but is now having dose limiting side-effects. His pain management team recommends using a medication that can reduce his opioid need through interaction with the NMDA-receptor. Which of the following was the most likely recommended agent?
Options:
(A): Propofol
(B): Ketamine
(C): Fentanyl
(D): Ketorolac
(E): Midazolam
",Ketamine,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Ketamine.

Explanation:
Ketamine is a medication that can reduce the need for opioids through its interaction with the NMDA-receptor. It acts as an NMDA-receptor antagonist, which can help to reduce opioid tolerance and dependence. Ketamine has been shown to be effective in managing pain in patients with cancer, including those with metastatic lung cancer. It can be used as an adjunct to opioids to provide additional pain relief and reduce the dose of opioids needed. Propofol, fentanyl, ketorolac, and midazolam are not NMDA-receptor antagonists and would not be recommended for reducing opioid need in this case.",
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of left shoulder pain for several weeks. He says that the pain often worsens when he tries to sleep on his left side. Although he tried several pain medications, none of the pain medications helped. He is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends. He denies any trauma during his practice sessions. On examination of the shoulder joint, severe tenderness was present localized to the greater tuberosity of the left shoulder joint along with biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove. The range of motion was limited to the left side. An X-ray of the joint showed narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion. Routine blood test results are normal except for the rheumatoid factor, which is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Trauma
(B): Referred pain from the neck and back
(C): Rheumatoid arthritis
(D): Osteoarthritis
(E): Rotator cuff injury
",Rotator cuff injury,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Rotator cuff injury.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a rotator cuff injury. The patient is an amateur tennis player who practices on weekends, which puts repetitive stress on the shoulder joint. The severe tenderness localized to the greater tuberosity and biceps tendon tenderness over the bicipital groove are consistent with a rotator cuff injury. The limited range of motion and worsening pain when sleeping on the affected side further support this diagnosis.

The X-ray findings of narrowing of the acromiohumeral space with sclerosis and spurring of the acromion are also consistent with chronic rotator cuff injury. These changes are seen in long-standing cases of rotator cuff injury and can lead to impingement of the rotator cuff tendons.

The positive rheumatoid factor is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis in this case. It is more likely related to the chronic inflammation and degenerative changes associated with the rotator cuff injury.

Trauma, referred pain from the neck and back, and osteoarthritis are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's history and examination findings. There is no history of trauma, and the pain is localized to the shoulder joint. The presence of biceps tendon tenderness and limited range of motion are not typical of referred pain from the neck and back. Osteoarthritis typically presents with more generalized joint pain and stiffness, rather than localized tenderness and limited range of motion.",
"A 17-year-old woman presents to your office concerned that she has not had her menstrual period in 4 months. She states that menses began at age of 13 and has been regular until two months ago. She denies sexual activity, and urine pregnancy test is negative. On exam, she appears well-nourished with a BMI of 21 kg/m^2, but you note that she has enlarged cheeks bilaterally and has calluses on the dorsum of her hands. She says that she has been very stressed with school and has recently been binge eating. What other finding do you expect to see in this patient?
Options:
(A): Malar rash
(B): Increased blood glucose level
(C): Erosion of tooth enamel
(D): Enlarged thyroid
(E): Elevated estrogen levels
",Erosion of tooth enamel,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Erosion of tooth enamel.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting or excessive exercise. The enlarged cheeks and calluses on the dorsum of her hands are signs of self-induced vomiting. In addition to these findings, patients with bulimia nervosa often have dental erosion due to the repeated exposure of the teeth to gastric acid during vomiting. This leads to the erosion of tooth enamel, which can result in tooth sensitivity, discoloration, and increased risk of dental caries. Therefore, the expected finding in this patient is erosion of tooth enamel.",
"A 23-year-old college student presents to the clinic with a history of intermittent chest discomfort. He reports that, about once per month for the past 8 or 9 months, he's had episodes of ""feeling like my chest is going to explode."" During these episodes, he also feels shortness of breath, feels shakiness throughout his arms and legs, and sweats so heavily that he needs to change his shirt. He is unsure of any clear precipitating factors but thinks they may occur more often around important exams or when big school projects are due. He shares that, as these episodes continue to recur, he has had mounting anxiety about having one when he is in class or at a restaurant. As a result, he is leaving the house less and less. He has no past medical history; the physical exam is unremarkable. Which of the following is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Citalopram
(B): Lithium
(C): Lorazepam
(D): Propranolol
(E): Quetiapine
",Citalopram,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Citalopram.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, it is likely that he is experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks are characterized by sudden and intense episodes of fear or discomfort, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, shakiness, and sweating. The fact that these episodes occur around important exams or when big school projects are due suggests that they may be triggered by stress and anxiety.

Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant that is commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, including panic disorder. It works by increasing the levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that helps regulate mood, in the brain. By addressing the underlying anxiety, citalopram can help prevent future panic attacks and improve the patient's overall quality of life.

Lithium is primarily used to treat bipolar disorder and is not indicated for the treatment of panic disorder. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that can provide short-term relief for acute anxiety symptoms, but it is not recommended for long-term management due to the risk of dependence and tolerance. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can help control physical symptoms such as rapid heart rate and trembling, but it does not address the underlying anxiety. Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic that may be used in certain cases of anxiety, but it is not typically the first-line treatment for panic disorder.

Therefore, citalopram is the best medication for the long-term management of this patient's condition.",
"A stillborn infant is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the stillborn shows a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, and club feet. An x-ray shows the absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following is the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Maternal oligohydramnios
(B): Intrauterine alcohol exposure
(C): Chromosome 13 trisomy
(D): Maternal diabetes
(E): Chromosome 18 trisomy
",Maternal diabetes,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Maternal diabetes.

Explanation:
The presentation of a stillborn infant with a small pelvis, shallow intergluteal cleft, club feet, and absence of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae is consistent with a condition known as caudal regression syndrome or sacral agenesis. This condition is strongly associated with maternal diabetes.

Maternal diabetes can lead to fetal malformations due to the effects of hyperglycemia on embryonic development. In the case of caudal regression syndrome, it is believed that the high blood sugar levels in the mother can disrupt the normal development of the caudal region of the embryo, leading to the absence or underdevelopment of the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae.

Other factors listed in the options, such as maternal oligohydramnios, intrauterine alcohol exposure, chromosome 13 trisomy, and chromosome 18 trisomy, are not typically associated with the specific findings seen in this case. While these factors can also contribute to fetal malformations, they are not the strongest predisposing factor for this patient's condition.",
"Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
The authors of the study have decided to conduct a follow-up analysis on their data. They decide to stratify their results by CD4+T-lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis. Among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, cART adherence was a significant predictor of DLBCL risk (RR = 0.52, p = 0.01). However, among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3, no relationship was found between DLBCL risk and cART adherence (RR = 0.96, p = 0.36). Which of the following explains for the difference observed between the two strata?""
Options:
(A): Poor generalizability
(B): Stratified sampling
(C): Random error
(D): Systematic error
(E): Effect modification
",Effect modification,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Effect modification.

Explanation: Effect modification refers to a situation where the relationship between an exposure (in this case, cART adherence) and an outcome (DLBCL risk) differs across different levels of a third variable (in this case, CD4+ cell count). In this study, the relationship between cART adherence and DLBCL risk was significant among patients with CD4+ cell counts below 200/mm3, but not among patients with CD4+ cell counts above 200/mm3. This suggests that the effect of cART adherence on DLBCL risk is modified by the CD4+ cell count. 

Effect modification is an important concept in epidemiology and can help explain why certain associations may be observed in some subgroups but not in others. In this case, it suggests that the impact of cART adherence on DLBCL risk may be influenced by the level of immune suppression as indicated by the CD4+ cell count.",
"During a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Th1 cells secrete a factor capable of stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages. In addition, the secreted factors help activate macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, which are capable of destroying the invading pathogen. Furthermore, activation of the macrophages by the secreted factor eventually leads to the formation of a tubercle. Which of the following factors is secreted by Th1 cells and responsible for these actions?
Options:
(A): IL-4
(B): TNF-alpha
(C): IFN-gamma
(D): Histamine
(E): IL-17
",IFN-gamma,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) IFN-gamma.

Explanation:
During a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, Th1 cells secrete IFN-gamma, which is responsible for stimulating phagosome-lysosome fusion within macrophages. This fusion exposes the bacteria to a lethal acidic, oxidizing environment, leading to their destruction. IFN-gamma also activates macrophages to produce mediators such as NO, which further contribute to the destruction of the invading pathogen. Additionally, activation of macrophages by IFN-gamma eventually leads to the formation of a tubercle, which is a characteristic feature of tuberculosis infection. 

IL-4 (A) is secreted by Th2 cells and is involved in promoting humoral immune responses and allergic reactions. It is not directly involved in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

TNF-alpha (B) is produced by macrophages and other immune cells in response to infection. While it plays a role in the immune response against tuberculosis, it is not secreted by Th1 cells.

Histamine (D) is a chemical mediator involved in allergic reactions and inflammation. It is not directly involved in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

IL-17 (E) is secreted by Th17 cells and is involved in promoting inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. It is not directly involved in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician because of abdominal pain and constipation for 3 weeks. His mother says he has been increasingly irritable recently. His vocabulary consists of 50 words and he does not use sentences. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae and abdominal tenderness. He refers to himself by name but is unable to name body parts or count to three. Peripheral blood smear shows small, pale red blood cells with basophilic stippling. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?
Options:
(A): Conversion of ferrous iron to ferric iron
(B): Conversion of porphobilinogen to hydroxymethylbilane
(C): Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen
(D): Conversion of homocysteine to methionine
(E): Conversion of uroporphyrinogen III to coproporphyrinogen III
",Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with lead poisoning. Lead inhibits the enzyme aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), which is responsible for the conversion of aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen in the heme synthesis pathway. This inhibition leads to an accumulation of aminolevulinic acid and its precursor, delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), in the body. The accumulation of ALA can cause abdominal pain and constipation, while the inhibition of heme synthesis can lead to microcytic anemia, as seen in this patient with small, pale red blood cells on peripheral blood smear. The patient's irritability and developmental delay are also consistent with lead poisoning, as lead exposure can affect neurodevelopment in young children.",
"A group of researchers conducted a study to determine whether there is an association between folic acid supplementation before pregnancy and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in offspring. The researchers retrospectively surveyed 200 mothers with children diagnosed with ASD during the first 4 years of life and 200 mothers with healthy children. All participants were interviewed about their prenatal consumption of folic acid using standardized questionnaires. A 94% response rate was obtained from the surveys. The study ultimately found that folic acid supplementation was associated with lower rates of ASD in offspring (OR = 0.3, p < 0.01). Which of the following type of bias is most likely to have influenced these results?
Options:
(A): Interviewer bias
(B): Latency period
(C): Recall bias
(D): Survival bias
(E): Length-time bias
",Recall bias,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Recall bias.

Explanation:
Recall bias occurs when there is a systematic difference in the accuracy or completeness of the information recalled by participants in a study. In this case, the researchers relied on the mothers' recall of their prenatal consumption of folic acid. Since the study was conducted retrospectively, there is a possibility that the mothers may not accurately remember or report their folic acid supplementation. This can introduce bias into the results, as the accuracy of the reported folic acid supplementation may differ between the mothers of children with ASD and the mothers of healthy children. This bias can lead to an overestimation or underestimation of the association between folic acid supplementation and ASD. Therefore, recall bias is most likely to have influenced these results.",
"A student studying pharmacology is a member of a team that is conducting research related to the elimination of multiple anticoagulant medications. His duty as a member of the team is to collect serum samples of the subjects every 4 hours and send them for analysis of serum drug levels. He is also supposed to collect, document and analyze the data. For one of the subjects, he notices that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. Which of the following anticoagulants did this patient most likely consume?
Options:
(A): Warfarin
(B): Enoxaparin
(C): Dabigatran
(D): Fondaparinux
(E): Apixaban
",Warfarin,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Warfarin.

Explanation:
The student noticed that the subject is eliminating 0.5 mg of the drug every 4 hours. This information suggests that the drug has a relatively short half-life. According to the context information provided, the half-life of warfarin ranges from 0.5 to 3 days. This means that after 4 hours, a significant amount of warfarin would have been eliminated from the body, which aligns with the observed elimination rate of 0.5 mg every 4 hours. 

On the other hand, the other anticoagulants mentioned in the options have longer half-lives. Enoxaparin, dabigatran, fondaparinux, and apixaban have half-lives of 2 to 3 hours, 20 hours, 20 hours, and 12 hours respectively. These half-lives indicate that these drugs would be eliminated at a slower rate compared to warfarin. Therefore, based on the observed elimination rate, warfarin is the most likely anticoagulant consumed by the patient.",
"A 40-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a checkup. She has felt weaker lately and has lost some weight. She denies any urinary issues. Her BUN at her last visit 4 months ago was 45 mg/dL, and her creatinine was 2.0 mg/dL. Her laboratory studies this visit are seen below:

Hemoglobin: 8 g/dL
Hematocrit: 29%
Leukocyte count: 9,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 197,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 5.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 17 mEq/L
BUN: 59 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.3 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.0 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Acute kidney failure
(B): Ascending pyelonephritis
(C): Chronic kidney failure
(D): Obstructive uropathy
(E): Renal cell carcinoma
",Chronic kidney failure,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Chronic kidney failure.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with chronic kidney failure. Chronic kidney failure is characterized by a progressive and irreversible decline in kidney function over time. The elevated BUN (59 mg/dL) and creatinine (2.3 mg/dL) levels indicate impaired kidney function. In chronic kidney failure, the BUN and creatinine levels gradually increase over time.

Other laboratory findings that support the diagnosis of chronic kidney failure include low hemoglobin (8 g/dL) and hematocrit (29%), which indicate anemia commonly seen in kidney failure. The electrolyte abnormalities, such as high potassium (5.9 mEq/L) and low bicarbonate (17 mEq/L), are also consistent with kidney dysfunction.

The patient's symptoms of weakness and weight loss are also common in chronic kidney failure. These symptoms can be attributed to the accumulation of waste products in the body due to impaired kidney function.

The other options are less likely based on the given information:
(A) Acute kidney failure typically presents with a sudden decline in kidney function and is often associated with a specific cause or event. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with chronic kidney failure.
(B) Ascending pyelonephritis is an infection of the kidneys that typically presents with fever, flank pain, and urinary symptoms. The patient denies any urinary issues, making this option less likely.
(D) Obstructive uropathy refers to a blockage in the urinary tract that can lead to kidney damage. The patient does not have any urinary symptoms or signs of obstruction, making this option less likely.
(E) Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that typically presents with symptoms such as blood in the urine, flank pain, and a palpable mass. The patient does not have any of these symptoms, making this option less likely.",
"A 28-year-old woman comes to the obstetrics and gynecology clinic because she has been unsuccessfully trying to conceive with her husband for the last 2 years. He has had 2 children from a previous marriage and has been tested for causes of male infertility. She has had prior abdominal surgery as well as a family history of endocrine abnormalities. Based on this history, a panel of tests are obtained and treatment is started. This treatment will be administered intermittently one week before her normal menstrual cycle. If the most likely drug prescribed in this case was administered in a different manner, which of the following conditions may also be treated by this drug?
Options:
(A): Diabetes
(B): Parkinson disease
(C): Polycystic ovarian syndrome
(D): Premature labor
(E): Prostate cancer
",Prostate cancer,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Prostate cancer.

The drug that is most likely prescribed in this case is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. GnRH agonists are commonly used in the treatment of female infertility to stimulate the release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and trigger ovulation. However, when administered in a different manner, such as in the case of prostate cancer treatment, GnRH agonists can have a different effect.

In the treatment of prostate cancer, GnRH agonists are used to suppress the production of testosterone, which is a hormone that promotes the growth of prostate cancer cells. By reducing testosterone levels, GnRH agonists can help slow down the progression of prostate cancer and alleviate symptoms.

It is important to note that the administration and dosage of GnRH agonists may vary depending on the specific condition being treated. In the case of female infertility, the drug is administered intermittently one week before the normal menstrual cycle to stimulate ovulation. In the case of prostate cancer, the drug is typically administered continuously to suppress testosterone production.

Therefore, if the most likely drug prescribed in this case (a GnRH agonist) was administered in a different manner, it could also be used to treat prostate cancer.",
"A 2-year-old girl with recurrent urinary tract infections is brought to the physician for a follow-up examination. Renal ultrasound shows bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis. A voiding cystourethrography shows retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition. Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes
(B): Glomerular crescents with macrophages
(C): Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation
(D): Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy
(E): Thickened glomerular capillary loops
",Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Cortical thinning with tubular atrophy.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of recurrent urinary tract infections, bilateral dilation of the renal pelvis, and retrograde flow of contrast into the ureters during micturition suggests a diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). VUR is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters and potentially up into the kidneys. This can lead to recurrent urinary tract infections and renal damage.

Histologic examination of a kidney biopsy specimen in a patient with VUR is most likely to show cortical thinning with tubular atrophy. This is because the reflux of urine can cause damage to the renal tubules, leading to their atrophy and loss. The cortical thinning is a result of the loss of functioning renal tissue.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and findings of VUR. Diffuse interstitial infiltration with T lymphocytes (option A) is more commonly seen in conditions such as acute interstitial nephritis. Glomerular crescents with macrophages (option B) are seen in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Matrix expansion with mesangial proliferation (option C) is seen in conditions such as IgA nephropathy. Thickened glomerular capillary loops (option E) are seen in conditions such as membranous nephropathy.",
"An unconscious 55-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by ambulance. He had recently lost his job and his house was about to begin foreclosure. His adult children were concerned for his well being and called the police requesting a welfare check. He was found unresponsive in his gurague. There were several empty bottles of vodka around him and one half empty container of antifreeze. A review of his medical records reveals that he was previously in good health. Upon arrival to the ED he regains consciousness.  His blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg, heart rate 120/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical exam his speech is slurred and he has difficulty following commands. His abdomen is diffusely tender to palpation with no rebound tenderness. Initial laboratory tests show an elevated serum creatinine (Cr) of 1.9 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 29 mg/dL. Which of the following findings would be expected in this patient’s urine?
Options:
(A): Eosinophilia
(B): Calcium oxalate crystals
(C): Hyaline casts
(D): Urine ketones
(E): Urate crystals
",Calcium oxalate crystals,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Calcium oxalate crystals.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical exam findings are consistent with ethylene glycol poisoning, which is commonly found in antifreeze. Ethylene glycol is metabolized in the liver to toxic metabolites, including oxalic acid. Oxalic acid combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate crystals, which can be seen in the urine of patients with ethylene glycol poisoning. These crystals can cause renal damage and acute kidney injury, which is supported by the elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels in this patient. The other options are not associated with ethylene glycol poisoning. Eosinophilia is an increase in eosinophils in the blood and is not specific to this condition. Hyaline casts are seen in various renal diseases but are not specific to ethylene glycol poisoning. Urine ketones are seen in conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis, not ethylene glycol poisoning. Urate crystals are seen in conditions such as gout, not ethylene glycol poisoning.",
"A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of an 8-month history of severe acne vulgaris over her face, upper back, arms, and buttocks. Treatment with oral antibiotics and topical combination therapy with benzoyl peroxide and retinoid has not completely resolved her symptoms. Examination shows oily skin with numerous comedones, pustules, and scarring over the face and upper back. Long-term therapy is started with combined oral contraceptive pills. This medication decreases the patient's risk developing of which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Hypertension
(B): Ovarian cancer
(C): Malignant melanoma
(D): Cervical cancer
(E): Breast cancer
",Ovarian cancer,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Ovarian cancer.

Explanation:
Combined oral contraceptive pills, which contain both estrogen and progestin, are commonly used in the treatment of acne vulgaris in women. These pills have been shown to decrease the risk of developing ovarian cancer. The use of combined oral contraceptives has been associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, as they suppress ovulation and decrease the exposure of the ovaries to estrogen. This protective effect is seen with long-term use of combined oral contraceptives. Therefore, in this case, starting long-term therapy with combined oral contraceptive pills will decrease the patient's risk of developing ovarian cancer.",
"A 48-year-old female presents for a follow-up appointment to discuss her ultrasound results. She presented with a lump in her neck 2 weeks ago. On examination, a thyroid nodule was present; the nodule was fixed, immobile, and non-tender. Ultrasound showed a hypoechoic nodule with a size of 2 cm. Histological examination of a fine needle biopsy was performed and cytological examination reported a likely suspicion of neoplasia. CT scan is performed to check for any lesions in the bones and/or lungs, common metastatic sites in this condition. Treatment with radioiodine therapy is planned after near-total thyroidectomy. Considering this tumor, which of the following is the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient?
Options:
(A): Trachea
(B): Hilar lymph nodes
(C): Cervical lymph nodes
(D): Inferior thyroid arteries
(E): Thyrohyoid muscle
",Inferior thyroid arteries,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Inferior thyroid arteries.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a thyroid nodule with suspicious cytological examination results, indicating a likely neoplasia. The most likely initial metastatic site in thyroid cancer is the lymph nodes, specifically the cervical lymph nodes. However, in this question, the options provided are not related to lymph nodes. 

Metastasis to the trachea, hilar lymph nodes, and thyrohyoid muscle are less common in thyroid cancer. The most likely initial metastatic site in this patient would be the inferior thyroid arteries. Thyroid cancer can spread to the blood vessels, including the inferior thyroid arteries, which supply blood to the thyroid gland. Therefore, the most likely initial metastatic site in this patient would be the inferior thyroid arteries.",
"A 39-year-old man presents to his primary care physician because he has been having severe headaches and fever for the last 2 days. He also says his right eyelid has been painlessly swelling and is starting to block his vision from that eye. He recently returned from a tour of the world where he visited Thailand, Ethiopia, and Brazil. Otherwise his past medical history is unremarkable. On presentation, his temperature is 102°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 126/81 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, and respirations are 13/min. Physical exam reveals a nontender swelling of the right eyelid, lymphadenopathy, and an indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg. Which of the following drugs should be used to treat this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Benznidazole
(B): Diethylcarbamazine
(C): Ivermectin
(D): Mebendazol
(E): Sodium stibogluconate
",Benznidazole,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Benznidazole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is transmitted by the bite of infected triatomine bugs, also known as ""kissing bugs."" The disease is endemic in parts of South and Central America, including Brazil.

The patient's recent travel to Brazil, along with the presence of fever, severe headaches, and swelling of the right eyelid (Romana's sign), are consistent with acute Chagas disease. Additionally, the indurated red patch with surrounding erythema and local swelling on his left leg (chagoma) is another characteristic finding of Chagas disease.

The drug of choice for the treatment of Chagas disease is benznidazole. Benznidazole is an antiparasitic medication that is effective against Trypanosoma cruzi. It is recommended for the treatment of acute and chronic Chagas disease, as well as for the prevention of congenital transmission.

Diethylcarbamazine (option B) is used for the treatment of lymphatic filariasis, not Chagas disease.

Ivermectin (option C) is used for the treatment of parasitic infections such as onchocerciasis (river blindness) and strongyloidiasis, but it is not the first-line treatment for Chagas disease.

Mebendazole (option D) is an anthelmintic medication used for the treatment of intestinal worm infections, such as roundworm, hookworm, and whipworm. It is not effective against Trypanosoma cruzi.

Sodium stibogluconate (option E) is an antimonial medication used for the treatment of leishmaniasis, not Chagas disease.",
"A 10-year-old Caucasian female with Turner's syndrome underwent an abdominal imaging study and was discovered that the poles of her kidneys were fused inferiorly. Normal ascension of kidney during embryological development would be prevented by which of the following anatomical structures?
Options:
(A): Inferior vena cava
(B): Superior mesenteric artery
(C): Inferior mesenteric artery
(D): Celiac artery
(E): Splenic artery
",Inferior mesenteric artery,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Inferior mesenteric artery.

Explanation:
During normal embryological development, the kidneys ascend from the pelvis to their final position in the retroperitoneal renal fossa. As each kidney ascends, it rotates through 90 degrees such that the renal hilum is directed medially. The ascending kidney derives its vascular supply locally from neighboring vessels. In the case of fusion anomalies, such as the one described in the question, the normal ascension of the kidney is prevented by an anatomical structure. In this case, the fusion of the poles of the kidneys is prevented by the inferior mesenteric artery, which crosses the isthmus at the level of L3-L4. This prevents the kidneys from ascending and results in their abnormal position.",
"A 34-year-old woman is assaulted and suffers a number of stab wounds to her abdomen. Bystanders call paramedics and she is subsequently taken to the nearest hospital. On arrival to the emergency department, her vitals are T: 36 deg C, HR: 110 bpm, BP: 100/60, RR: 12, SaO2: 99%. A FAST and abdominal CT are promptly obtained which are demonstrated in Figures A and B, respectively. Her chart demonstrates no other medical problems and vaccinations/boosters up to date. The patient is diagnosed with a Grade V splenic laceration and is immediately brought to the OR for emergent splenectomy. The splenectomy is successfully performed with removal of the damaged spleen (Figure C). Following the operation, the patient should receive which of the following vaccines: (I) H. influenzae (II) Tetanus (III) N. meningitidis (IV) S. pneumoniae (V) Hepatitis B
Options:
(A): I, II
(B): I, III, IV
(C): I, V
(D): II only
(E): III, IV
","I, III, IV",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): I, III, IV.

Following splenectomy, patients are at an increased risk of developing infections, particularly from encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, it is recommended that patients receive vaccinations against these organisms to prevent overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis.

Option I: H. influenzae - This vaccine is recommended because patients without a spleen are at an increased risk of infection with H. influenzae.

Option III: N. meningitidis - This vaccine is recommended because patients without a spleen are at an increased risk of infection with N. meningitidis.

Option IV: S. pneumoniae - This vaccine is recommended because patients without a spleen are at an increased risk of infection with S. pneumoniae.

Option V: Hepatitis B - This vaccine is not specifically indicated following splenectomy. Hepatitis B is primarily transmitted through blood and sexual contact, and the risk of infection is not significantly increased in patients without a spleen.

Option II: Tetanus - Tetanus vaccination is not specifically indicated following splenectomy. Tetanus is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which is commonly found in soil and can enter the body through open wounds. The risk of tetanus infection is not significantly increased in patients without a spleen. However, tetanus vaccination is recommended for all individuals to maintain immunity against this potentially life-threatening infection.",
"Researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene, the gene responsible for cystic fibrosis. It is believed that, in addition to the commonly found ΔF508 mutation, a novel mutation in this gene is found in a particular population under study. Which of the following would most likely suggest that these two loci have a high probability of being closely linked?
Options:
(A): LOD Score < 1
(B): LOD Score < 3
(C): LOD Score < 2
(D): LOD Score > 3
(E): LOD Score = 0
",LOD Score > 3,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): LOD Score > 3.

Explanation:
A LOD (logarithm of odds) score is a statistical measure used to determine the likelihood of two loci being closely linked. A LOD score greater than 3 indicates strong evidence for linkage between the two loci.

In this case, the researchers are studying the inheritance pattern of mutations in the CFTR gene, specifically the commonly found ΔF508 mutation and a novel mutation. If these two loci have a high probability of being closely linked, it means that they are likely to be inherited together more often than expected by chance.

Therefore, a LOD score greater than 3 would suggest a high probability of linkage between the ΔF508 mutation and the novel mutation in the CFTR gene.",
"A 28-year-old woman returns to the clinic to follow up on a recent abnormal cervical biopsy that demonstrated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I. The patient is quite anxious about the implications of this diagnosis. Her physical examination is within normal limits. Her vital signs do not show any abnormalities at this time. Her past medical, family, and social histories are all non-contributory. Which of the following is the appropriate management of a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient?
Options:
(A): Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months
(B): Cryotherapy ablation
(C): Laser ablation
(D): Loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP)
(E): Hysterectomy
","Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months",Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months.

Explanation:
The appropriate management for a newly diagnosed CIN I in a 24-year-old patient is close observation, pap smear screening at 6 and 12 months, and HPV DNA testing at 12 months. CIN I is a low-grade lesion that has a low risk of progression to cervical cancer. Therefore, close observation with regular pap smear screening and HPV DNA testing is recommended to monitor for any changes in the lesion. If the cytology remains negative and HPV DNA testing is negative after 12 months, then the patient can transition to routine cervical cancer screening every three years. This approach allows for conservative management while still ensuring appropriate surveillance for any potential progression of the lesion. Cryotherapy ablation, laser ablation, loop electrosurgical excision (LEEP), and hysterectomy are not indicated for CIN I, as they are more invasive treatments that are typically reserved for higher-grade lesions or cases where there is suspicion of invasive disease.",
"A clinical researcher is interested in creating a new drug for HIV patients. Darunavir has been particularly efficacious in recent patients; however, some have experienced an increased incidence of hyperglycemia. A new drug called DN501 is developed with the same mechanism of action as darunavir but fewer side effects. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of DN501?
Options:
(A): Prevents viral transcription
(B): Inhibits viral assembly
(C): Inhibits integration of viral genome into the host cell
(D): Inhibits viral entry
(E): Prevents T-cell binding
",Inhibits viral assembly,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Inhibits viral assembly.

Explanation:
Darunavir, the drug mentioned in the question, inhibits the cleavage of viral Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors into individual functional proteins required for infectious HIV. This results in the formation of immature, noninfectious viral particles. Since DN501 has the same mechanism of action as darunavir but with fewer side effects, it can be inferred that DN501 also inhibits viral assembly. Inhibition of viral assembly is an effective strategy to prevent the production of infectious HIV particles and reduce viral replication.",
"A 58-year-old white man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a painless lesion on his lower lip. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He has worked as a fruit picker for the past 25 years. His current medications include captopril and metformin. Examination of the oral cavity shows a single ulcer near the vermillion border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Squamous cell carcinoma
(B): Herpes labialis
(C): Aphthous stomatitis
(D): Actinic keratosis
(E): Traumatic ulcer
",Squamous cell carcinoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of smoking, the presence of a painless ulcer on the lower lip, and the location of the ulcer near the vermillion border, the most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that commonly occurs on the lips, especially in individuals with a history of tobacco use. The painless nature of the lesion is also consistent with squamous cell carcinoma, as it often presents as a non-healing ulcer. Other options such as herpes labialis, aphthous stomatitis, actinic keratosis, and traumatic ulcer are less likely based on the clinical presentation and patient history.",
"An investigator is studying the effect of drug X on the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene on chromosome 13 in endometrial cells. Endometrial cells obtained from study participants are plated on growth media and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured with flow cytometry. Drug X, which is known to activate cyclin-dependent kinase 4, is administered to all the cells, and the distribution of cell cycle phase is measured again 1 hour later. Which of the following is most likely to result from the action of drug X on the Rb gene?
Options:
(A): G1 phase arrest
(B): Prophase I arrest
(C): Initiation of S phase
(D): Completion of G2 phase
(E): Initiation of G0 phase
",Initiation of S phase,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Initiation of S phase.

Explanation:
The retinoblastoma (Rb) gene plays a role in regulating the cell cycle and progression from the G1 phase to the S phase. When the Rb gene is active, it restricts the cell's ability to progress from G1 to S phase. However, when the Rb gene is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), it becomes inactive and allows the cell to enter the S phase.

In this scenario, drug X is known to activate CDK4. Therefore, the most likely result of drug X's action on the Rb gene is the initiation of the S phase. This means that the cells will progress from the G1 phase to the S phase, leading to DNA synthesis and replication.

It is important to note that the other options are not likely outcomes of drug X's action on the Rb gene. G1 phase arrest (option A) would occur if the Rb gene remained active and prevented progression to the S phase. Prophase I arrest (option B) is not relevant to the action of drug X on the Rb gene. Completion of G2 phase (option D) and initiation of G0 phase (option E) are also not directly related to the action of drug X on the Rb gene.",
"A 65-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck over the past week. He also says he has been having intermittent fevers and severe night sweats which require a change of bed sheets the next day. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 10 years ago with which he admits to not always being compliant with his antiretroviral medication. The patient reports a 20-pack-year smoking history but no alcohol or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a 6 kg (13.2 lb) unintentional weight loss over the past 2 months. The vital signs include: temperature 37.8℃ (100.0℉) and blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. On physical examination, there are multiple non-tender swollen lymph nodes averaging 2 cm in diameter that is palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. Axillary and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present on the right side. A cardiopulmonary exam is unremarkable. The spleen size is 16 cm on percussion. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 88 μm3
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
    Serum creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Serum lactate dehydrogenase 1,000 U/L
An excisional biopsy of a superficial axillary lymph node on the right is performed and a histopathologic analysis confirms the most likely diagnosis. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient?
Options:
(A): Antinuclear antibody
(B): Hepatitis C virus antibodies
(C): JAK-2 mutation
(D): Peripheral blood flow cytometry
(E): Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test
",Hepatitis C virus antibodies,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Hepatitis C virus antibodies.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is lymphoma, specifically non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The patient's symptoms of painless swelling of the neck, fevers, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and lymphadenopathy are consistent with lymphoma. The presence of multiple swollen lymph nodes in the neck, axillary, and inguinal regions further supports this diagnosis.

In patients with HIV, the risk of developing NHL is significantly increased. Additionally, the patient's non-compliance with antiretroviral medication may have contributed to the development of lymphoma.

The next best diagnostic step in the workup of this patient is to test for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies. HCV infection is a known risk factor for the development of NHL, particularly in patients with HIV. The presence of HCV antibodies would further support the diagnosis of lymphoma and help guide treatment decisions.

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is not indicated in this patient as there are no specific findings to suggest an autoimmune disorder.

JAK-2 mutation testing is not relevant in this case as it is associated with myeloproliferative neoplasms, not lymphoma.

Peripheral blood flow cytometry is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating lymphomas, but it is not the next best step in this patient's workup. A lymph node biopsy has already been performed and confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma.

The Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test is used to evaluate for hairy cell leukemia, which typically presents with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. While the patient does have splenomegaly, the pancytopenia is not severe enough to suggest hairy cell leukemia. Additionally, the histopathologic analysis of the lymph node biopsy did not show the characteristic findings of hairy cell leukemia.",
"In order to assess the feasibility and evaluate the outcomes of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures, a group of orthopedic surgeons studied 14 patients with primary and periprosthetic fractures of the thigh bone. Parameters such as patient demographic, type of implant, number of wires used, fracture union rate, and potential complications were thoroughly recorded and analyzed in all the patients, with a mean duration of patient follow-up of 16 months. Union was achieved in all patients with a mean duration of 90 days, and there were no complications found in patients included in the study. The authors were satisfied with their findings and, due to the prospective nature of their research, submitted their study to a journal as a cohort study (which they noted in the study title as well). However, the journal editor returned the article, suggesting that it should be submitted as a case series instead. The editor made this suggestion to the authors for which of the following reasons?
Options:
(A): Lack of a comparison group
(B): No prevalence assessment
(C): Low number of patients
(D): Ascertainment bias
(E): Lack of risk calculation
",Lack of risk calculation,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Lack of a comparison group.

Explanation:
The editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series instead of a cohort study because there was a lack of a comparison group. In a cohort study, researchers compare the outcomes of a group of patients who receive a specific treatment or intervention with a control group that does not receive the treatment or intervention. This allows for a comparison of outcomes and helps to determine the effectiveness of the treatment or intervention. In this study, there was no control group included, so the researchers were unable to compare the outcomes of the patients who received cerclage wiring with a group of patients who did not receive this treatment. Without a comparison group, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of cerclage wiring as a supportive approach to osteosynthesis in femur fractures. Therefore, the editor suggested that the study should be submitted as a case series, which is a descriptive study that presents detailed information about a group of patients with a similar condition or treatment.",
"A 67-year-old woman presents from home hospice with a change in her mental status. She has seemed more confused lately and is unable to verbalize her symptoms. Her temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 117/65 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a right upper quadrant mass that elicits discomfort when palpated. Ultrasound is notable for pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening without any gallstones. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Acalculous cholecystitis
(B): Calculous cholescystitis
(C): Choledocholithiasis
(D): Emphysematous cholecystitis
(E): Hepatic adenoma
",Acalculous cholecystitis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Acalculous cholecystitis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acalculous cholecystitis. Acalculous cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder without the presence of gallstones. It is more common in critically ill patients and those with underlying conditions such as sepsis, trauma, or prolonged fasting. The patient's fever, right upper quadrant mass, and gallbladder wall thickening on ultrasound are all consistent with acalculous cholecystitis. The absence of gallstones on ultrasound helps to differentiate it from calculous cholecystitis. Choledocholithiasis is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct, which would typically present with jaundice and elevated liver function tests. Emphysematous cholecystitis is a rare form of cholecystitis characterized by gas in the gallbladder wall, which is not seen in this patient. Hepatic adenoma is a benign liver tumor and would not explain the patient's symptoms.",
"A 35-year-old female is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. The patient is found to have a blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL. Hgb A1c was found to be 5.1%. C-peptide level was found to be decreased. The patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement. She states that she has never had an episode like this before. She has no significant past medical history but reports a family history of diabetes in her mother. She states that she has been undergoing a difficult divorce over the past few months. What is the likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Insulinoma
(B): Factitious disorder
(C): Alimentary hypogylcemia
(D): Hypothyroidism
(E): Somatization disorder
",Factitious disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Factitious disorder.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presents with hypoglycemia (blood glucose level of 35 mg/dL) and a decreased C-peptide level. The fact that the patient returned to her baseline after glucose replacement suggests that the hypoglycemia was not due to an endogenous insulin-producing tumor (insulinoma) or other organic causes such as alimentary hypoglycemia or hypothyroidism.

The patient's history of a difficult divorce and the absence of any significant past medical history suggest a possible psychological component to her symptoms. Factitious disorder is a condition in which individuals intentionally produce or feign physical or psychological symptoms for the purpose of assuming the sick role. In this case, the patient may be intentionally causing her own hypoglycemia, possibly as a means of gaining attention or sympathy during a difficult time in her life.

It is important to consider factitious disorder in cases of unexplained hypoglycemia, especially when there is no clear organic cause and the symptoms have a random occurrence. Laboratory tests, including measurements of insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and insulin secretagogues, can help differentiate between endogenous and exogenous sources of insulin and aid in the diagnosis of factitious hypoglycemia.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to the physician with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes for the past 2 months. He does not complain of any pain during urination. He is frustrated that he has to wake up 2 or 3 times per night to urinate even though he tried reducing the amount of water he consumes before bed and made some other dietary changes without any improvement. He has no family history of prostate disease. Physical examination is negative for any suprapubic mass or tenderness, and there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Urinalysis and serum creatinine
(B): Ultrasonography
(C): Reassurance
(D): Digital rectal examination
(E): Prostate-specific antigen
",Digital rectal examination,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Digital rectal examination.

Explanation:
In this patient with complaints of increased urinary frequency and decreasing volumes, the best next step in management is a digital rectal examination (DRE). This examination allows for the assessment of the prostate gland, which is important in evaluating for potential causes of urinary symptoms.

The patient's symptoms, including increased urinary frequency and nocturia (waking up multiple times at night to urinate), are suggestive of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). LUTS can be caused by various conditions, including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, urinary tract infection, and bladder dysfunction.

A digital rectal examination is a simple and non-invasive procedure that allows for the assessment of the prostate gland. It can help identify any abnormalities, such as an enlarged prostate or nodules, which may suggest BPH or prostate cancer. Additionally, the absence of any suprapubic mass or tenderness on physical examination does not rule out prostate pathology, as the prostate gland may still be enlarged.

Other options such as urinalysis and serum creatinine (A), ultrasonography (B), reassurance (C), and prostate-specific antigen (E) may also be useful in the evaluation of urinary symptoms, but a digital rectal examination is the most appropriate initial step in this patient. Urinalysis and serum creatinine can help assess for infection or kidney dysfunction. Ultrasonography can provide additional information about the size and structure of the prostate gland. Reassurance may be appropriate in some cases, but further evaluation is warranted in this patient given the persistence of symptoms. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is controversial and should be considered in patients with a longer life expectancy, as it can help detect prostate cancer, but it is not the best initial step in this patient.",
"A 48-year-old woman with chronic tension headaches comes to the physician because of several episodes of bilateral flank pain and reddish urine within the past month. Current medications include aspirin, which she takes almost daily for headaches. Her temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F) and her blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows costovertebral tenderness to percussion bilaterally. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 10.2 g/dL and serum creatinine concentration of 2.4 mg/dL. Urine studies show:
Urine
Protein
3+
RBC > 16/hpf
WBC 2/hpf
There are no casts or dysmorphic RBCs visualized on microscopic analysis of the urine. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria?""
Options:
(A): Tubular lumen obstruction by protein casts
(B): Necrotizing inflammation of the renal glomeruli
(C): Bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma
(D): Lipid peroxidation within tubular cells
(E): Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels
",Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with renal ischemia, which can cause hematuria. The presence of bilateral flank pain, costovertebral tenderness, and elevated blood pressure suggests renal involvement. The patient's history of chronic tension headaches and daily aspirin use may contribute to the development of renal ischemia. Aspirin can inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, leading to vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels and decreased blood flow to the kidneys. This can result in ischemia and subsequent hematuria. The absence of protein casts, dysmorphic red blood cells, and glomerular inflammation on urine analysis makes options A, B, and D less likely. Bacterial infection of the renal parenchyma (option C) typically presents with other signs of infection, such as fever and leukocytosis, which are not present in this patient. Therefore, vasoconstriction of the medullary vessels is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's hematuria.",
"A 37-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and dull suprapubic pain for 3 hours. She has had spotting during the last 3 days. Her medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 89/65 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a dilated cervical os and a uterus consistent in size with an 11-week gestation. Ultrasonography shows an embryo of 4 cm in crown-rump length and no fetal cardiac activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Misoprostol therapy
(B): Follow-up ultrasonography
(C): Methotrexate therapy
(D): Dilation and curettage
(E): Complete bed rest
",Dilation and curettage,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Dilation and curettage.

Explanation:
This patient presents with vaginal bleeding, suprapubic pain, and a dilated cervical os, which are concerning for a miscarriage. The ultrasound findings of an embryo with no fetal cardiac activity further support this diagnosis. Dilation and curettage (D&C) is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. D&C involves dilating the cervix and removing the contents of the uterus, which can help confirm the diagnosis of a miscarriage and prevent complications such as infection or excessive bleeding. Misoprostol therapy (choice A) is a medical management option for miscarriage, but it is typically reserved for patients who are stable and have a smaller gestational age. Follow-up ultrasonography (choice B) may be appropriate in some cases, but given the patient's symptoms and findings, immediate intervention with D&C is warranted. Methotrexate therapy (choice C) is used for the management of ectopic pregnancy, not miscarriage. Complete bed rest (choice E) has not been shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage and is not recommended as a management option.",
"A 17-year-old female accidentally eats a granola bar manufactured on equipment that processes peanuts. She develops type I hypersensitivity-mediated histamine release, resulting in pruritic wheals on the skin. Which of the following layers of this patient's skin would demonstrate histologic changes on biopsy of her lesions?
Options:
(A): Stratum corneum
(B): Stratum granulosum
(C): Stratum spinosum
(D): Stratum basale
(E): Dermis
",Dermis,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Dermis.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is experiencing a type I hypersensitivity reaction, which is an immediate allergic reaction mediated by histamine release. This histamine release leads to the development of pruritic wheals on the skin, also known as hives or urticaria.

Histologic changes on biopsy of the lesions would be seen in the dermis. The dermis is the layer of the skin located beneath the epidermis and is composed of connective tissue. It contains blood vessels, nerves, and immune cells, which play a role in the inflammatory response.

During a type I hypersensitivity reaction, histamine is released from mast cells and basophils in response to an allergen. Histamine causes vasodilation and increased permeability of blood vessels in the dermis, leading to the characteristic wheals seen in urticaria. These wheals are transient and typically resolve within 24 hours.

Therefore, histologic changes associated with the type I hypersensitivity reaction would be observed in the dermis, making option (E) the correct choice.",
"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a persistent cough, fever, and vomiting. The past year the child has been admitted to the hospital 3 times with pneumonia. For the past 1 week, the child has been experiencing thick purulent cough and says that her chest feels ‘heavy’. Her stools have been loose and foul-smelling over the past week. Her parents are also concerned that she has not gained much weight due to her frequent hospital visits. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. On physical exam, the temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). She appears lethargic and uncomfortable. Crackles are heard in the lower lung bases, with dullness to percussion. A small nasal polyp is also present on inspection. Which of the following is the most likely cause for the girl’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator
(B): Inefficient breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine
(C): Dysfunction in the motility of respiratory cilia
(D): Acute hypersensitivity changes and bronchospasm
(E): Deficiency in lymphocytic activity
",Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator.

Explanation:
The girl's symptoms, including persistent cough, fever, vomiting, thick purulent cough, and chest heaviness, along with a history of recurrent pneumonia, suggest a chronic respiratory condition. The presence of crackles in the lower lung bases and dullness to percussion on physical exam further support a respiratory pathology. Additionally, the foul-smelling loose stools and poor weight gain indicate malabsorption and failure to thrive.

The small nasal polyp observed on inspection is a characteristic finding in cystic fibrosis (CF), which is caused by dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is responsible for regulating the movement of chloride ions across cell membranes, and its dysfunction leads to thick, sticky mucus production in various organs, including the respiratory system.

The symptoms of CF, such as chronic cough, recurrent respiratory infections, and failure to thrive, are consistent with the girl's presentation. The presence of a nasal polyp further supports the diagnosis of CF. Therefore, dysfunction in a transmembrane regulator, specifically CFTR, is the most likely cause of the girl's symptoms.",
"A 48-year-old man seeks evaluation at a clinic with a complaint of breathlessness for the past couple of weeks. He says that he finds it difficult to walk a few blocks and has to rest. He also complains of a cough for the past 3 months, which is dry and hacking in nature. The medical history is relevant for an idiopathic arrhythmia for which he takes amiodarone daily. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. He denies any use of illicit drugs. The vital signs are as follows: heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.6°C (99.68°F), and blood pressure 132/70 mm Hg. The physical examination is significant for inspiratory crackles over the lung bases. An echocardiogram shows a normal ejection fraction. A chest radiograph is performed and shown below. Which of the following findings will most likely be noted on spirometry?
Options:
(A): Decreased FEV1 and normal FVC
(B): Decreased FEV1 and FVC with decreased FEV1/FVC ratio
(C): Normal FEV1 and FVC
(D): Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio
(E): Increased FEV1 and FVC
",Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Decreased FEV1 and FVC with normal FEV1/FVC ratio.

The patient's symptoms of breathlessness and cough, along with the physical examination findings of inspiratory crackles over the lung bases, suggest a respiratory condition. The chest radiograph may show findings consistent with interstitial lung disease, such as fibrosis or inflammation.

Spirometry is a pulmonary function test that measures lung volumes and airflow. In this case, the most likely spirometry findings would be decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), indicating a restrictive lung pattern. This is because interstitial lung disease can cause scarring and stiffness of the lung tissue, leading to reduced lung volumes.

However, the normal FEV1/FVC ratio suggests that there is no significant obstruction of the airways. This is important because a decreased FEV1/FVC ratio would be seen in obstructive lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

In summary, the most likely spirometry findings in this patient would be decreased FEV1 and FVC with a normal FEV1/FVC ratio, indicating a restrictive lung pattern.",
"A 2,300 g (5 lb) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores were 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant?
Options:
(A): Administer zidovudine
(B): HIV antibody testing
(C): HIV DNA testing
(D): HIV RNA testing
(E): Reassurance and follow-up
",Administer zidovudine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Administer zidovudine.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. The newborn appears healthy with no abnormalities on physical examination. The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer zidovudine.

According to the guidelines for the prevention of vertical HIV transmission in resource-rich settings, infants born to mothers who have a sustained viral load <50 copies/mL at and after 36 weeks of gestation should receive two weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis if they meet certain criteria. These criteria include being born at ≥37 weeks of gestation, having a mother who did not have acute or primary HIV infection during pregnancy, having a mother who achieved and maintained viral suppression during pregnancy and delivery, and having a mother who is currently receiving and has received at least 10 consecutive weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART) during pregnancy. Since the mother in this scenario meets these criteria, the infant should receive two weeks of zidovudine prophylaxis.

HIV antibody testing (B), HIV DNA testing (C), and HIV RNA testing (D) are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this infant. These tests are used for diagnosing HIV infection, but in this case, the infant is not showing any signs or symptoms of HIV infection. Therefore, administering zidovudine for prophylaxis is the appropriate course of action.

Reassurance and follow-up (E) is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this infant. Given the mother's HIV status, it is important to provide prophylaxis to reduce the risk of vertical transmission of HIV to the infant. Therefore, administering zidovudine is necessary in this case.",
"A 60-year-old woman presents to a physician for worsening shortness of breath and increasing abdominal distention over the last 3 months. She says that the shortness of breath is worse on exertion and improves with rest. While she could previously walk to the nearby store for her groceries, she now has to drive because she gets ''winded'' on the way. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago and is compliant with her medications. The medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The physical examination reveals gross ascites and visibly engorged periumbilical veins. Bilateral pitting edema is noted around the ankles. The finger-prick blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL. What is the mechanism of action of the anti-diabetic medication this patient is most likely taking?
Options:
(A): Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
(B): Binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor
(C): Closure of ATP-sensitive K-channels in the pancreatic beta-cell
(D): Increased gene expression of GLUT-4
(E): Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist
",Increased gene expression of GLUT-4,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Increased gene expression of GLUT-4.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of worsening shortness of breath, increasing abdominal distention, and gross ascites, it is likely that she is experiencing complications of heart failure. The presence of visibly engorged periumbilical veins and bilateral pitting edema further support this diagnosis.

The patient's history of diabetes and compliance with medications suggests that she is taking an anti-diabetic medication to manage her diabetes. The most likely mechanism of action for this medication is increased gene expression of GLUT-4.

GLUT-4 is a glucose transporter protein that is responsible for the uptake of glucose into cells, particularly muscle and adipose tissue. Increased gene expression of GLUT-4 would result in an increased number of GLUT-4 transporters on the cell surface, allowing for enhanced glucose uptake.

By increasing glucose uptake into cells, this medication helps to lower blood glucose levels and improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, it is important to note that the patient's finger-prick blood glucose level of 100 mg/dL is within the normal range, suggesting that her diabetes is well-controlled.",
"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of episodic pelvic pain radiating to her back and thighs for 4 months. The pain occurs a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days. She has been taking ibuprofen, which has provided some relief. Menses have occurred at regular 28-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years and last for 5 to 6 days. She is sexually active with two male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin
(B): Ascending infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue
(C): Fluid-filled sac within the ovary
(D): Pregnancy
(E): Hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium
",Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Endometrial sloughing and uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandin.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including episodic pelvic pain that occurs a few hours before her menstrual period and lasts for 2 days, are consistent with dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is characterized by low, midline, wave-like, cramping pelvic pain that can radiate to the back or inner thighs. The pain is caused by uterine contractions mediated by prostaglandins, which are released during endometrial sloughing. The fact that the patient has been taking ibuprofen, which has provided some relief, further supports the diagnosis of dysmenorrhea. 

The other options are not likely causes of the patient's symptoms:
(B) Ascending infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, or surrounding tissue would typically present with other symptoms such as fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, or pelvic tenderness on physical examination.
(C) A fluid-filled sac within the ovary (ovarian cyst) can cause pelvic pain, but it would not typically be associated with the timing of the patient's menstrual cycle.
(D) Pregnancy would present with other symptoms such as missed periods, breast changes, and positive pregnancy test.
(E) A hormone-sensitive smooth muscle tumor of the myometrium (uterine fibroid) can cause pelvic pain, but it would not typically be associated with the timing of the patient's menstrual cycle. Additionally, uterine fibroids are more common in older women and would be less likely in a 15-year-old.",
"A 25-year-old male is hospitalized for acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia. His parents report that he has been experiencing flu-like symptoms for one week prior to hospital admission. Five weeks ago, the patient was in Mexico, where he went on several spelunking expeditions with friends. The patient ultimately becomes comatose and dies. Autopsy of brain tissue suggests a viral infection. The likely causal virus spreads to the central nervous system (CNS) in the following manner:
Options:
(A): Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges
(B): Entrance via cribiform plate
(C): Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons
(D): Reactivation of virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia
(E): Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
",Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms and the autopsy findings suggest a viral infection that has spread to the central nervous system (CNS). Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons is the most likely mechanism of spread in this case.

The patient's symptoms of acute agitation, photophobia, and dysphagia are consistent with CNS involvement. Additionally, the fact that the patient had flu-like symptoms prior to hospital admission suggests a viral etiology.

Retrograde migration up peripheral nerve axons is a common mechanism by which certain viruses, such as rabies virus, can spread to the CNS. In this case, the patient's history of spelunking expeditions in Mexico suggests a possible exposure to a virus that can be transmitted through animal bites or scratches, such as the rabies virus.

Hematogenous dissemination to the meninges (option A) is less likely in this case, as there is no mention of systemic symptoms or signs of infection in other organs.

Entrance via the cribiform plate (option B) is unlikely, as this route of entry is more commonly associated with certain bacteria, such as those causing meningitis.

Reactivation of a virus previously latent in dorsal root ganglia (option D) is not supported by the information provided, as there is no mention of a previous infection or history of symptoms suggestive of a latent viral infection.

Infection of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes (option E) is not a common mechanism of viral spread to the CNS and is not supported by the information provided.",
"A 19-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with hypopigmented skin. He undergoes a skin biopsy and is found to have an absence of melanocytes in the epidermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Tinea versicolor
(B): Albinism
(C): Vitiligo
(D): Solar lentigo
(E): Melanoma
",Vitiligo,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Vitiligo.

Explanation:
Vitiligo is a condition characterized by the loss of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, in the epidermis. This results in hypopigmented or depigmented patches of skin. It can affect individuals of any race or ethnicity, but it is more noticeable in individuals with darker skin tones. In this case, the patient is a 19-year-old Caucasian male, which is consistent with the presentation of vitiligo.

Tinea versicolor (option A) is a fungal infection that causes patches of discolored skin, typically lighter or darker than the surrounding skin. It is not characterized by the absence of melanocytes.

Albinism (option B) is a genetic condition that results in the absence or reduction of melanin production. It is typically present from birth and affects the entire body, including the skin, hair, and eyes. It is not characterized by patches of hypopigmented skin.

Solar lentigo (option D) is a type of hyperpigmentation that occurs as a result of sun exposure. It is characterized by small, dark spots on the skin and is not associated with the absence of melanocytes.

Melanoma (option E) is a type of skin cancer that arises from melanocytes. It typically presents as a dark, irregularly shaped mole or lesion on the skin. It is not characterized by hypopigmented skin patches or the absence of melanocytes.",
"A 51-year-old man presents for a routine check-up. He has no complaints. At his last annual visit, his physical and laboratory tests were unremarkable. His past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, well managed with rosuvastatin, and hypertension, well managed with hydrochlorothiazide. His current medications also include aspirin. The patient is afebrile, and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. His laboratory tests are significant for the following:
WBC 29,500/mm3
Hematocrit 26.1%
Hemoglobin 9.1 g/dL
Platelet count 298,000/mm3
A peripheral blood smear and differential shows 92% small normocytic lymphocytes. The patient’s diagnosis in confirmed by bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry. He is monitored through regular follow-up visits. Three years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presents with swollen cervical and axillary lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss of 4.5 kg (approx. 10 lb), and “rib pain” on his right side. On physical examination, there is palpable, firm, non-tender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy bilaterally. He also has moderate splenomegaly, which, when palpated, elicits pain. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Doxorubicinrn
(B): Bleomycinrn
(C): Imatinib
(D): Fludarabinern
(E): Vincristinern
",Fludarabinern,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Fludarabine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of leukemia characterized by the accumulation of small, mature lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues.

The patient's symptoms of swollen lymph nodes, unintentional weight loss, and rib pain are consistent with progressive disease and indicate the need for treatment. The presence of moderate splenomegaly further supports the need for intervention.

Fludarabine is a purine analog that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for CLL. It is a chemotherapy drug that works by inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing apoptosis in lymphocytes. Fludarabine has been shown to be effective in reducing lymphocyte counts, improving symptoms, and prolonging survival in patients with CLL.

The other options listed (A) Doxorubicin, (B) Bleomycin, (C) Imatinib, and (E) Vincristine are not typically used in the treatment of CLL. Doxorubicin and Bleomycin are more commonly used in the treatment of solid tumors, while Imatinib is used in the treatment of certain types of leukemia (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia) but not CLL. Vincristine is primarily used in the treatment of lymphomas, but its role in CLL is limited.

Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient's most likely diagnosis of CLL is Fludarabine.",
"A 62-year-old woman is evaluated because of a 3-day history of headache, nausea, and decreased urination. Laboratory studies show:

Arterial blood gas analysis on room air shows a pH of 7.28 and a HCO3- concentration of 14 mEq/L. Prolonged treatment with which of the following drugs would best explain this patient's findings?""
Options:
(A): Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(B): Acetazolamide
(C): Eplerenone
(D): Amphotericin B
(E): Heparin
",Amphotericin B,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Amphotericin B.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with metabolic acidosis, as evidenced by a low serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration and a pH below the normal range. Metabolic acidosis can be caused by various factors, including drug-induced causes.

Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication that is known to cause renal tubular acidosis (RTA), which can lead to metabolic acidosis. RTA is characterized by impaired renal acidification, resulting in decreased excretion of hydrogen ions and reduced reabsorption of bicarbonate. This leads to a decrease in serum bicarbonate concentration and a subsequent decrease in pH.

The patient's symptoms of headache, nausea, and decreased urination are also consistent with the effects of metabolic acidosis. Headache can occur due to cerebral vasodilation, nausea can result from gastrointestinal disturbances, and decreased urination can be a consequence of decreased renal blood flow.

Therefore, prolonged treatment with Amphotericin B would best explain this patient's findings of metabolic acidosis, as well as her symptoms.",
"A 21-year-old male presents to his primary care provider for fatigue. He reports that he graduated from college last month and returned 3 days ago from a 2 week vacation to Vietnam and Cambodia. For the past 2 days, he has developed a worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists. The patient has a past medical history of asthma managed with albuterol as needed. He is sexually active with both men and women, and he uses condoms “most of the time.” On physical exam, the patient’s temperature is 102.5°F (39.2°C), blood pressure is 112/66 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints and a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs. Tourniquet test is negative. Laboratory results are as follows:

Bilirubin (conjugated): 0.3 mg/dL

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Chikungunya
(B): Dengue fever
(C): Epstein-Barr virus
(D): Hepatitis A
(E): Typhoid fever
",Chikungunya,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Chikungunya.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Chikungunya infection. Chikungunya is a viral infection transmitted by the Aedes mosquito, which is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions. The patient's recent travel to Vietnam and Cambodia puts him at risk for exposure to the virus.

The symptoms of Chikungunya typically include fever, headache, malaise, and joint pain, which can be severe and debilitating. The patient's worsening headache, malaise, and pain in his hands and wrists are consistent with these symptoms.

On physical exam, the patient has tenderness to palpation over his bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints, which is a common finding in Chikungunya infection. Additionally, he has a maculopapular rash on his trunk and upper thighs, which is another characteristic feature of Chikungunya.

The laboratory results in this patient are not specific for Chikungunya, but they can help rule out other possible diagnoses. The leukocyte count is low, which is consistent with a viral infection. The platelet count is slightly low, which can be seen in Chikungunya but is more commonly associated with Dengue fever. The liver function tests (AST and ALT) are mildly elevated, which can be seen in viral infections, including Chikungunya.

In summary, based on the patient's travel history, symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Chikungunya.",
"Three days after admission to the intensive care unit for septic shock and bacteremia from a urinary tract infection, a 34-year-old woman has persistent hypotension. Her blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli, for which she has been receiving appropriate antibiotics since admission. She has no history of any serious illness. She does not use illicit drugs. Current medications include norepinephrine, ceftriaxone, and acetaminophen. She appears well. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), heart rate is 96/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. Examination of the back shows costovertebral tenderness bilaterally. Examination of the thyroid gland shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
  Hospital day 1 Hospital day 3

Hemoglobin 14.1 mg/dL 13.4 mg/dL
Serum
Creatinine 1.4 mg/dL 0.9 mg/dL
Fasting glucose 95 mg/dL 100 mg/dL
TSH   1.8 µU/mL
T3, free   0.1 ng/dL
T4, free   0.9 ng/dL
Repeat blood cultures are negative. A chest X-ray shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?
Options:
(A): Bromocriptine
(B): Levothyroxine
(C): Removing toxic drugs
(D): Thiamine therapy
(E): Treating the underlying illness
",Treating the underlying illness,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Treating the underlying illness.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has persistent hypotension three days after admission to the intensive care unit for septic shock and bacteremia from a urinary tract infection. Her blood cultures are positive for Escherichia coli, for which she has been receiving appropriate antibiotics since admission. The laboratory studies show a decrease in leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine, as well as an increase in fasting glucose. The thyroid function tests show low levels of T3 and T4, with a normal TSH level. 

These laboratory abnormalities are consistent with sick euthyroid syndrome, also known as non-thyroidal illness syndrome. Sick euthyroid syndrome is a condition in which there is a decrease in thyroid hormone levels without primary dysfunction of the thyroid gland. It is commonly seen in critically ill patients and is thought to be a result of alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis due to the underlying illness.

The most appropriate treatment for sick euthyroid syndrome is to treat the underlying illness. In this case, the patient has septic shock and bacteremia from a urinary tract infection, which should be the focus of treatment. Treating the infection and providing supportive care, such as fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy, are essential in managing the patient's hypotension and overall condition.

The other options listed are not appropriate for the management of sick euthyroid syndrome in this case. Bromocriptine is a medication used to treat hyperprolactinemia and Parkinson's disease, but it is not indicated for sick euthyroid syndrome. Levothyroxine is a thyroid hormone replacement medication and is not necessary in this case because the patient's TSH level is normal. Removing toxic drugs may be necessary if the patient is taking any medications that are contributing to the illness, but there is no indication in the case that toxic drugs are causing the sick euthyroid syndrome. Thiamine therapy is used to treat thiamine deficiency, which can cause Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but it is not indicated in this case.",
"An 11-year-old child complains of pain in the leg while playing. Blood pressure in the upper limb is 140/90 mm Hg and lower limbs are 110/70 mm Hg. There is a brachiofemoral delay in the pulse. Auscultation shows a loud S1, loud S2, and S4. There is a presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area. Chest X-ray reveals the notching of the ribs. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Pulmonic stenosis
(B): Patent ductus arteriosus
(C): Coarctation of the aorta
(D): Aortic stenosis
(E): Transposition of great vessels
",Coarctation of the aorta,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Coarctation of the aorta.

Explanation:
Coarctation of the aorta is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on the clinical presentation and findings. Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect characterized by narrowing of the aorta, usually near the insertion of the ductus arteriosus. 

The blood pressure findings in this patient are consistent with coarctation of the aorta. Blood pressure in the upper limb is elevated (140/90 mm Hg) while blood pressure in the lower limbs is lower (110/70 mm Hg). This is known as ""brachiofemoral delay"" and is a classic finding in coarctation of the aorta.

Auscultation findings also support the diagnosis. The presence of a loud S1, loud S2, and S4 suggests increased left ventricular filling pressures, which can occur in coarctation of the aorta.

The presence of an ejection systolic murmur in the interscapular area is another clue. This murmur is caused by turbulent blood flow across the narrowed segment of the aorta.

Chest X-ray findings of notching of the ribs further support the diagnosis. Notching of the ribs occurs due to collateral circulation developing between the intercostal arteries and the internal mammary arteries, which is a compensatory mechanism in coarctation of the aorta.

In summary, the combination of brachiofemoral delay in blood pressure, auscultation findings, and chest X-ray findings of notching of the ribs strongly suggest coarctation of the aorta as the most likely diagnosis in this patient.",
"A 59-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of excruciating left knee pain for 4 days. He underwent a total knee arthroplasty of his left knee joint 4 months ago. He has hypertension and osteoarthritis. Current medications include glucosamine, amlodipine, and meloxicam. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 118/71 mm Hg. Examination shows a tender, swollen left knee joint; range of motion is limited by pain. Analysis of the synovial fluid confirms septic arthritis, and the prosthesis is removed. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism?
Options:
(A): Staphylococcus epidermidis
(B): Escherichia coli
(C): Staphylococcus aureus
(D): Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(E): Group B Streptococcus
",Staphylococcus epidermidis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Staphylococcus epidermidis.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of total knee arthroplasty and symptoms of septic arthritis, the most likely causal organism is Staphylococcus epidermidis. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of prosthetic joint infections, particularly in the setting of orthopedic surgery. It is a part of the normal skin flora and can easily colonize prosthetic devices. Risk factors for Staphylococcus epidermidis infection include the presence of a prosthetic device, recent surgery, and immunosuppression. The patient's symptoms of a tender, swollen joint with limited range of motion are consistent with septic arthritis. Analysis of the synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis. Other organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Group B Streptococcus, can also cause septic arthritis, but Staphylococcus epidermidis is the most likely in this patient given his history of knee arthroplasty.",
"A 47-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite for 1 week, followed by right shoulder pain, generalized abdominal pain, and paroxysmal cough. He has had diabetes mellitus for 15 years, for which he takes metformin and gliclazide. His vital signs include a temperature of 38.3°C (101.0°F), pulse of 85/min, and blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, he is ill-appearing, and he has a tender liver edge that is palpable approx. 2 cm below the right costal margin. Percussion and movement worsens the pain. Abdominal ultrasonography is shown. Stool is negative for Entamoeba histolytica antigen. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient condition?
Options:
(A): Metronidazole and paromomycin
(B): Antifungal therapy
(C): Cholecystectomy
(D): Antibiotics and drainage
(E): Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
",Antibiotics and drainage,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Antibiotics and drainage.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is liver abscess. The patient has fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, right shoulder pain (referred pain from the diaphragm), generalized abdominal pain, and a tender liver edge. These symptoms, along with the presence of diabetes mellitus, suggest a pyogenic liver abscess, which is commonly caused by bacterial infection.

The initial step in management of a liver abscess is to administer antibiotics and perform drainage. Antibiotics are necessary to treat the underlying infection, while drainage is required to evacuate the abscess and prevent complications such as rupture or spread of infection.

Metronidazole and paromomycin (option A) are used to treat amebic liver abscess, which is caused by Entamoeba histolytica. However, the stool test in this patient was negative for E. histolytica antigen, making amebic liver abscess less likely.

Antifungal therapy (option B) is not indicated in the management of a pyogenic liver abscess. Fungal liver abscess is rare and usually occurs in immunocompromised individuals.

Cholecystectomy (option C) is the surgical removal of the gallbladder and is not the appropriate initial step in the management of a liver abscess. Cholecystectomy is indicated for gallbladder-related conditions such as cholecystitis or gallstones.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (option E) is a procedure used to diagnose and treat conditions of the bile ducts and pancreas. It is not the initial step in the management of a liver abscess. ERCP may be considered if there is suspicion of biliary obstruction or if there is a need for further evaluation of the biliary tree.",
"A 36-year-old recent immigrant from India presents with a face similar to that seen in the image A. Examination of his face reveals skin that is thick and contains many lesions. The patient complains that he has experienced a loss of sensation in his toes and fingertips, which has caused him to injure himself often. Biopsy of the skin is likely to reveal bacteria that are:
Options:
(A): Cocci
(B): Acid-fast
(C): Catalase-negative
(D): Thermophiles
(E): Tennis-racket shaped
",Acid-fast,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Acid-fast.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of thickened skin with many lesions and loss of sensation in the toes and fingertips is suggestive of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae, which is acid-fast.

Acid-fast bacteria are characterized by their ability to retain a red stain (carbol fuchsin) even after being exposed to acid-alcohol. This staining property is due to the high lipid content in their cell walls, which makes them resistant to decolorization. Acid-fast staining is commonly used to identify mycobacteria, including M. leprae.

Cocci (choice A) are spherical bacteria, which are not typically associated with leprosy. Catalase-negative bacteria (choice C) lack the enzyme catalase, which is not relevant to the diagnosis of leprosy. Thermophiles (choice D) are bacteria that thrive in high-temperature environments and are not associated with leprosy. Tennis-racket shaped bacteria (choice E) are not a known characteristic of any specific bacteria and are not relevant to the diagnosis of leprosy.",
"A 55-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of a progressively growing mass in his axilla. During this period, he has had recurrent episodes of low-grade fever lasting for 7 to 10 days, and an 8-kg (18-lb) weight loss. His only medication is a multivitamin. Physical examination shows nontender, right axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. His serum calcium concentration is 15.1 mg/dL and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration is 9 pg/mL. A lymph node biopsy shows granuloma formation and large CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?
Options:
(A): Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol
(B): Increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells
(C): Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells
(D): Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes
(E): Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells
",Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma, which is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. These cells are large, CD15-positive, CD30-positive cells with bilobed nuclei, as seen in the lymph node biopsy. The patient also has lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and elevated serum calcium levels.

In Hodgkin lymphoma, activated T-lymphocytes secrete γ-interferon, which leads to the activation of macrophages. The activated macrophages then produce 1-alpha-hydroxylase, an enzyme that converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This active form of vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium and stimulates osteoclast activity, leading to hypercalcemia.

Excessive intake of dietary ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) (option A) would not explain the laboratory findings in this patient, as the hypercalcemia is due to the secretion of γ-interferon by activated T-lymphocytes.

Increased release of PTH by parathyroid chief cells (option B) would lead to hyperparathyroidism and increased serum PTH levels, which is not seen in this patient.

Induction of focal osteolysis by tumor cells (option C) would lead to localized bone destruction, but it would not explain the systemic symptoms and laboratory findings seen in this patient.

Production of PTH-related peptide by malignant cells (option E) is seen in some malignancies, such as squamous cell carcinoma of the lung, but it is not a characteristic finding in Hodgkin lymphoma. Additionally, PTH-related peptide would lead to increased serum PTH levels, which is not seen in this patient.",
"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician for a pre-employment examination. He recently traveled to Guatemala. He feels well but has not seen a physician in several years, and his immunization records are unavailable. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Anti-HAV IgM Positive
Anti-HAV IgG Negative
HBsAg Negative
Anti-HBs Positive
HBcAg Negative
Anti-HBc Negative
HBeAg Negative
Anti-HBe Negative
Anti-HCV Negative
Which of the following best explains this patient's laboratory findings?""
Options:
(A): Active hepatitis B infection
(B): Active hepatitis A infection
(C): Previous hepatitis A infection
(D): Chronic hepatitis B infection
(E): Chronic hepatitis C infection
",Active hepatitis A infection,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Active hepatitis A infection.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings indicate an active hepatitis A infection. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is an RNA virus that causes acute hepatitis. The presence of Anti-HAV IgM antibodies indicates an acute infection, while the absence of Anti-HAV IgG antibodies suggests that the patient has not been previously exposed to HAV. 

The negative results for HBsAg, Anti-HBs, HBcAg, Anti-HBc, HBeAg, Anti-HBe, and Anti-HCV indicate that the patient does not have an active hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. 

The patient's recent travel to Guatemala is also a clue, as hepatitis A is more common in developing countries with poor sanitation. 

Overall, the combination of a positive Anti-HAV IgM and negative Anti-HAV IgG, along with the absence of markers for hepatitis B and C, strongly suggests an active hepatitis A infection.",
"A 7-month-old male infant is brought to the pediatrician by his mother. She reports that the child develops severe sunburns every time the infant is exposed to sunlight. She has applied copious amounts of sunscreen to the infant but this has not helped the problem. On examination, there are multiple areas of reddened skin primarily in sun exposed areas. The child’s corneas appear irritated and erythematous. Which of the following processes is likely impaired in this patient?
Options:
(A): Nucleotide excision repair
(B): Non-homologous end joining
(C): Homologous recombination
(D): Mismatch repair
(E): Base excision repair
",Nucleotide excision repair,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Nucleotide excision repair.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the infant develops severe sunburns every time he is exposed to sunlight, despite the application of sunscreen. This suggests that the child has an impaired ability to repair DNA damage caused by UV radiation.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the process responsible for repairing DNA damage caused by UV radiation. It is the primary mechanism for removing bulky DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. In individuals with a defect in NER, such as those with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), the ability to repair UV-induced DNA damage is impaired. This leads to increased sensitivity to sunlight and a higher risk of developing skin cancer.

The symptoms described in the case, including severe sunburns, reddened skin primarily in sun-exposed areas, and irritated and erythematous corneas, are consistent with the clinical features of xeroderma pigmentosum.

Therefore, the impaired process in this patient is likely nucleotide excision repair (A).",
"A 65-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a neck mass. He first noticed a firm mass on the anterior aspect of his neck approximately 4 months ago. The mass is painless and has not increased in size since then. He has also noticed occasional fatigue and has gained 10 pounds in the past 4 months despite no change in his diet or exercise frequency. His past medical history is notable for gout for which he takes allopurinol. He denies any prior thyroid disorder. He runs 4 times per week and eats a balanced diet of mostly fruits and vegetables. He does not smoke and drinks a glass of wine with dinner. His family history is notable for medullary thyroid cancer in his maternal uncle. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 127/72 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, he has a firm, symmetric, and stone-firm thyroid. A biopsy of this patient's lesion would most likely demonstrate which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles
(B): Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate
(C): Papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions
(D): Pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis
(E): Stromal amyloid deposition
",Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of a firm, painless neck mass that has not increased in size, along with symptoms of fatigue and weight gain, the most likely diagnosis is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the destruction of thyroid follicles by lymphocytes and plasma cells. This results in a dense fibroinflammatory infiltrate in the thyroid gland.

Option (A) is incorrect because diffuse infiltrate of lymphoid cells destroying thyroid follicles is characteristic of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, not the findings on biopsy.

Option (C) is incorrect because papillary projections with dystrophically calcified regions are characteristic of papillary thyroid carcinoma, not Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Option (D) is incorrect because pleomorphic undifferentiated infiltrative cells with necrosis are characteristic of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, not Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Option (E) is incorrect because stromal amyloid deposition is characteristic of medullary thyroid carcinoma, not Hashimoto's thyroiditis.",
"A group of researchers decided to explore whether the estimates of incidence and prevalence rates of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were influenced by the number of years it took to examine administrative data. These estimates were not only based on hospital discharges, but also on physician billing codes. For study purposes, the researchers labeled incident cases at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases were those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Which statement is true regarding the relationship between incidence and prevalence rates during the time period that might be chosen for this specific study?
Options:
(A): Examining successively longer time periods will result in substantially lower prevalence estimates.
(B): Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.
(C): The prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will be overestimated.
(D): The inclusion of attack rates would increase incidence estimates in longer time periods.
(E): The inclusion of attack rates would decrease incidence estimates in shorter time periods.
",Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Incidence rates will be higher during shorter time periods than longer periods.

Explanation:
In this specific study, incident cases are labeled at the initial occurrence of SLE diagnosis in the hospital database, while prevalent cases are those that were coded as harboring SLE at any time, with patients maintaining their diagnosis until death. Incidence refers to the number of new cases of a disease that occur within a specific time period, while prevalence refers to the total number of cases of a disease that exist within a population at a given point in time. 

When examining successively shorter time periods, the incidence rates will be higher because more new cases will be captured within those shorter time frames. This is because shorter time periods allow for a more accurate identification of new cases, while longer time periods may include cases that were previously diagnosed and are still prevalent. Therefore, examining shorter time periods will result in higher incidence rates.

On the other hand, prevalence estimates are influenced not only by the number of new cases (incidence) but also by the length of time that cases have the disorder (duration). Prevalence rates reflect both increases in new cases and the duration of the disorder. Examining successively longer time periods will not result in substantially lower prevalence estimates because it includes both new and existing cases. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.

The inclusion of attack rates would not affect the incidence estimates in longer or shorter time periods. Attack rates refer to the number of new cases of a disease that occur within a specific time period divided by the population at risk. It does not impact the overall incidence estimates. Therefore, options (D) and (E) are incorrect.

Option (C) is also incorrect because the prevalence of SLE during consecutively shorter time windows will not be overestimated. Prevalence estimates are influenced by both new cases and the duration of the disorder, not the length of the time window.",
"A 48-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of progressive weakness and shortness of breath. She has had progressive shortness of breath over the last year with an intermittent non-productive cough. In addition, she complains of difficulty raising her arms to brush her hair. Her temperature is 99.6°F (37.6°C), pulse is 80/min, blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Neurologic exam shows 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles bilaterally. Diffuse dry crackles are heard on lung auscultation. A faint erythematous rash is noted on the malar cheeks, periorbital areas, lateral proximal thighs, and the elbows. Which of the following tests is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Muscle biopsy
(B): CT scan
(C): Pulmonary function tests
(D): Serum ANA titer
(E): Skin biopsy
",Muscle biopsy,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Muscle biopsy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of progressive weakness, shortness of breath, and difficulty raising her arms, along with the physical findings of 4/5 strength in the deltoid muscles and diffuse dry crackles on lung auscultation, the most likely diagnosis is dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy that affects the muscles and skin. It is characterized by muscle weakness, skin rash, and systemic symptoms.

To confirm the diagnosis of dermatomyositis, a muscle biopsy is the most appropriate test. Muscle biopsy can show characteristic findings such as perifascicular atrophy, inflammation, and necrosis in the muscle tissue. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of dermatomyositis.

CT scan may be useful to evaluate the extent of lung involvement in dermatomyositis, but it is not the most likely test to confirm the diagnosis.

Pulmonary function tests may show restrictive lung disease in dermatomyositis, but they are not specific for the diagnosis and would not confirm it.

Serum ANA (antinuclear antibody) titer may be elevated in dermatomyositis, but it is not specific for the diagnosis and would not confirm it.

Skin biopsy may show characteristic findings such as interface dermatitis and mucin deposition in the skin tissue, which are consistent with dermatomyositis. However, a muscle biopsy is more likely to confirm the diagnosis as it directly evaluates the affected muscle tissue.",
"A 46-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of a cough for 6 months. He has been taking over-the-counter cough medications, but they have not helped much. He adds that he expectorated bloody sputum the previous night. He denies breathlessness but mentions that he frequently experiences fatigue after little physical exertion. There is no past history of any specific medical disorder. His father died of lung cancer at the age of 54 years. His temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse rate is 82/min, the blood pressure is 118/80 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 18/min. Auscultation of his chest reveals the presence of localized rhonchi over the interscapular region. A plain radiograph of the chest shows a coin-like opacity in the right lung. Further diagnostic evaluation confirms the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma of the lung. If his blood were to be sent for laboratory evaluation, which of the following proteins is most likely to be elevated in his serum?
Options:
(A): Bence-Jones protein
(B): Calcitonin
(C): CA 15-3
(D): Lactate dehydrogenase
(E): Neuron-specific enolase
",Neuron-specific enolase,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Neuron-specific enolase.

Explanation:
Small cell carcinoma of the lung is a type of lung cancer that is known to secrete various neuroendocrine markers. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is one of these markers and is commonly elevated in patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung. NSE is an enzyme that is found in neurons and neuroendocrine cells, and its levels can be measured in the blood as a tumor marker.

In this case, the patient's symptoms, such as a chronic cough, bloody sputum, and fatigue, along with the presence of a coin-like opacity on the chest radiograph, are consistent with small cell carcinoma of the lung. Given the patient's diagnosis and the fact that small cell carcinoma of the lung is known to secrete neuroendocrine markers, it is likely that his serum NSE levels would be elevated.

The other options, Bence-Jones protein, calcitonin, CA 15-3, and lactate dehydrogenase, are not typically associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung. Bence-Jones protein is associated with multiple myeloma, calcitonin is associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma, CA 15-3 is associated with breast cancer, and lactate dehydrogenase is a nonspecific marker of tissue damage. Therefore, these options are not the most likely to be elevated in this patient's serum.",
"A 41-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with abdominal pain. He says that the pain “comes and goes” throughout the day and usually lasts 20-30 minutes per episode. He can point to the spot 1-2 inches above the umbilicus where he feels the pain. He denies any feeling of regurgitation or nighttime cough but endorses nausea. He reports that he used to eat three large meals per day but has found that eating more frequently improves his pain. He tried a couple pills of ibuprofen with food over the past couple days and thinks it helped. He has gained four pounds since his past appointment three months ago. The patient denies any diarrhea or change in his stools. He has no past medical history. He drinks 5-6 beers on the weekend and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. He denies any family history of cancer. On physical exam, he is tender to palpation above the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are present. A stool guaiac test is positive. The patient undergoes endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose his condition.

Which of the following is most likely to be found on histology?
Options:
(A): Mucosal defect in the stomach
(B): Urease-producing organism in the small intestine
(C): PAS-positive material in the small intestine
(D): Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine
(E): Crypt abscesses in the large intestine
",Urease-producing organism in the small intestine,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Urease-producing organism in the small intestine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and history, the most likely diagnosis is peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain that improves with eating and the positive stool guaiac test suggest an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The location of the pain, 1-2 inches above the umbilicus, is consistent with the location of the duodenum, which is the most common site for peptic ulcers.

Histologically, peptic ulcers are characterized by the presence of an urease-producing organism called Helicobacter pylori. This bacterium is known to colonize the gastric mucosa and is strongly associated with the development of peptic ulcers. The presence of H. pylori can be confirmed on histology by staining for the organism using special stains such as the Warthin-Starry stain or immunohistochemistry.

Mucosal defects in the stomach (option A) can be seen in conditions such as gastric ulcers, but the patient's symptoms and location of pain are more consistent with duodenal ulcers. PAS-positive material in the small intestine (option C) is seen in conditions such as Whipple disease, which typically presents with weight loss, diarrhea, and joint pain, none of which are described in this patient. Noncaseating granulomas in the small intestine (option D) are seen in conditions such as Crohn's disease, but the patient's symptoms and history are not suggestive of this diagnosis. Crypt abscesses in the large intestine (option E) are seen in conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, but the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.",
"A 5-year-old female presents to the pediatrician for a routine office visit. The patient is in kindergarten and doing well in school. She is learning to read and is able to write her first name. Her teacher has no concerns. The patient’s mother is concerned that the patient is a picky eater and often returns home from school with most of her packed lunch uneaten. The patient’s past medical history is significant for moderate persistent asthma, which has required three separate week-long courses of prednisone over the last year and recently diagnosed myopia. The patient’s mother is 5’7”, and the patient’s father is 5’10”. The patient’s weight and height are in the 55th and 5th percentile, respectively, which is consistent with her growth curve. On physical exam, the patient has a low hairline and a broad chest. Her lungs are clear with a mild expiratory wheeze. The patient’s abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. She has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair.

This patient is most likely to have which of the following additional findings?
Options:
(A): Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear
(B): Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level
(C): Elevated serum TSH level
(D): Low serum ACTH level
(E): Mass in the sella turcica
",Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Absent Barr bodies on buccal smear.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Turner syndrome, which is characterized by the absence of one X chromosome in females. The patient has several features associated with Turner syndrome, including a low hairline, broad chest, and short stature. In addition, she has Tanner stage I breast development and pubic hair, which is consistent with delayed puberty. 

One of the diagnostic tests for Turner syndrome is a buccal smear, which can reveal the absence of Barr bodies. Barr bodies are condensed, inactivated X chromosomes that are typically seen in the nuclei of cells in females. In Turner syndrome, the absence of one X chromosome leads to the absence of Barr bodies on buccal smear. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be absent Barr bodies on buccal smear. 

The other options are not consistent with the presentation of Turner syndrome. Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level is not a characteristic finding in Turner syndrome. Elevated serum TSH level is more commonly seen in hypothyroidism, which is not typically associated with Turner syndrome. Low serum ACTH level is not a characteristic finding in Turner syndrome. A mass in the sella turcica is more commonly seen in conditions such as pituitary adenoma, which is not typically associated with Turner syndrome.",
" A 61-year-old man was started on rosuvastatin 40 mg 8 weeks ago and presents today for a follow-up. He complains of pain in his legs and general weakness. On physical exam, he has full range of motion of his extremities but complains of pain. His blood pressure is 126/84 mm Hg and heart rate is 74/min. The decision is made to stop the statin and return to the clinic in 2 weeks to assess any changes in symptoms. After stopping the statin, his muscular symptoms resolve. What is the next best course of action to take regarding his LDL control?
Options:
(A): Restart rosuvastatin at a lower dose
(B): Initiate fenofibrate
(C): Initiate a different statin
(D): Initiate fish oils
(E): Do not initiate any new lipid-lowering therapies
",Restart rosuvastatin at a lower dose,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Restart rosuvastatin at a lower dose.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient experienced muscular symptoms while on rosuvastatin, which resolved after stopping the medication. According to the guidelines, if the symptoms are mild to moderate, the statin should be stopped and the patient should wait until the symptoms resolve. After resolution, the same statin can be reinitiated at a lower dose. This approach allows for the benefits of statin therapy to be maintained while minimizing the risk of recurrent muscular symptoms. If the symptoms recur after reinitiating the statin, then alternative lipid-lowering therapies can be considered. Therefore, the next best course of action in this case would be to restart rosuvastatin at a lower dose.",
"An unidentified surgical specimen is received for histopathologic analysis. A portion of the specimen is cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The remainder is analyzed and is found to contains type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Which of the following structures is most likely the origin of this surgical specimen?
Options:
(A): Blood vessel
(B): Pinna
(C): Pubic symphysis
(D): Lens
(E): Larynx
",Larynx,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Larynx.

Explanation:
The presence of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate in the analyzed specimen suggests that it is derived from a structure that contains cartilage. Type II collagen is the main collagen type found in cartilage, and chondroitin sulfate is a major component of cartilage matrix.

Among the given options, the larynx is the structure that contains cartilage. The larynx, also known as the voice box, is located in the throat and is responsible for producing sound. It is composed of several cartilages, including the thyroid cartilage, cricoid cartilage, and arytenoid cartilages.

Therefore, based on the presence of type II collagen and chondroitin sulfate, the most likely origin of this surgical specimen is the larynx.",
"A 70-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for 1 day. Computed tomography shows a small bowel perforation. The patient is prepared for emergent exploratory laparotomy. She is sedated with midazolam, induced with propofol, intubated, and maintained on nitrous oxide and isoflurane for the duration of the surgery. A single perforation in the terminal ileum is diagnosed intraoperatively and successfully repaired. The patient is transferred to the intensive care unit. The ventilator is set at an FiO2 of 50%, tidal volume of 1000 mL, respiratory rate of 12/min, and positive end-expiratory pressure of 2.5 cm H2O. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 76/min, and blood pressure is 111/50 mm Hg. She is responsive to painful stimuli. Lung examination shows bilateral rales. Abdominal examination shows a distended abdomen and intact abdominal surgical incisions. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.44
pO2 54 mm Hg
pCO2 31 mm Hg
HCO3- 22 mm Hg
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""
Options:
(A): Increase the FiO2
(B): Extubate
(C): Increase the tidal volume
(D): Increase PEEP
(E): Increase the respiratory rate
",Increase PEEP,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Increase PEEP.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario has undergone surgery for a small bowel perforation and is now in the intensive care unit. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low pO2 of 54 mm Hg, indicating hypoxemia. The patient also has bilateral rales on lung examination, suggesting pulmonary edema. These findings suggest that the patient may be experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

ARDS is a severe form of acute lung injury characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. It can occur as a result of various conditions, including sepsis, trauma, and aspiration. In this case, the small bowel perforation and subsequent surgery may have contributed to the development of ARDS.

The best next step in the management of this patient is to increase positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). PEEP is a mechanical ventilation strategy that helps to recruit collapsed alveoli and improve oxygenation. By increasing PEEP, the alveoli are kept open during expiration, preventing atelectasis and improving oxygenation.

Increasing the FiO2 (option A) alone may not be sufficient to improve oxygenation in this patient. FiO2 represents the fraction of inspired oxygen and increasing it can increase the oxygen concentration delivered to the patient. However, in ARDS, the problem is not just with the oxygen concentration but also with the ability of the lungs to exchange oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. Therefore, increasing PEEP is a more effective strategy to improve oxygenation in this case.

Extubating the patient (option B) is not appropriate at this time as the patient is still experiencing hypoxemia and pulmonary edema. Extubation should only be considered when the patient's condition has improved and they are able to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation on their own.

Increasing the tidal volume (option C) or the respiratory rate (option E) may not be beneficial and can potentially worsen the patient's condition. In ARDS, a lung-protective ventilation strategy with lower tidal volumes and lower respiratory rates is recommended to minimize further lung injury.

In summary, the best next step in the management of this patient is to increase PEEP to improve oxygenation and prevent atelectasis in the setting of acute respiratory distress syndrome.",
"A 43-year-old man with a history of hepatitis C and current intravenous drug use presents with 5 days of fever, chills, headache, and severe back pain. On physical exam, temperature is 100.6 deg F (38.1 deg C), blood pressure is 109/56 mmHg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 18/min. He is thin and diaphoretic with pinpoint pupils, poor dentition, and track marks on his arms and legs. A high-pitched systolic murmur is heard, loudest in the left sternal border and with inspiration. He is admitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. One of the blood cultures drawn 12 hours ago returns positive for Staphylococcus aureus. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Repeat blood cultures now
(B): Repeat blood cultures 24 hours after initial cultures were drawn
(C): Repeat blood cultures 36 hours after initial cultures were drawn
(D): Repeat blood cultures 48 hours after initial cultures were drawn
(E): Do not repeat blood cultures
",Repeat blood cultures now,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Repeat blood cultures now.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presents with symptoms consistent with endocarditis, including fever, chills, and a new murmur. The positive blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus further supports the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. It is important to repeat the blood cultures immediately to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism. This is because the initial blood culture may have been contaminated or there may be a need to identify the specific strain of Staphylococcus aureus, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which would require different treatment options. Delaying the repeat blood cultures may lead to a delay in appropriate treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. Therefore, repeating the blood cultures now is the most appropriate next step.",
"A 42-year-old man with AIDS comes to the physician for intermittent fever, nonproductive cough, malaise, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, and a 3.6-kg (8-lb) weight loss over the past month. He has not seen a doctor since he became uninsured 2 years ago. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Abdominal examination shows mild, diffuse tenderness throughout the lower quadrants. The liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin, and the spleen is palpated 1–2 cm below the left costal margin. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 49/mm3 (N ≥ 500 mm3). Blood cultures grow acid-fast organisms. A PPD skin test shows 4 mm of induration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Voriconazole
(B): Amphotericin B and itraconazole
(C): Erythromycin
(D): Azithromycin and ethambutol
(E): Rifampin and isoniazid
",Azithromycin and ethambutol,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Azithromycin and ethambutol.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. MAC is a common opportunistic infection in patients with advanced HIV/AIDS and is characterized by fever, weight loss, abdominal pain, and hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis is confirmed by blood cultures growing acid-fast organisms.

The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for MAC infection is a combination of macrolide antibiotics (such as azithromycin) and ethambutol. Macrolides, such as azithromycin, are the cornerstone of MAC treatment and have excellent intracellular penetration. Ethambutol is added to the regimen to prevent the development of resistance.

Voriconazole (choice A) is an antifungal medication and is not effective against MAC.

Amphotericin B and itraconazole (choice B) are antifungal medications and are not effective against MAC.

Erythromycin (choice C) is a macrolide antibiotic, but it is not the preferred choice for MAC treatment. Azithromycin is preferred due to its better pharmacokinetic profile and once-daily dosing.

Rifampin and isoniazid (choice E) are first-line medications for the treatment of tuberculosis, but they are not effective against MAC.",
"A 49-year-old woman comes to the physician for a scheduled colposcopy. Two weeks ago, she had a routine Pap smear that showed atypical squamous cells. Colposcopy shows an area of white discoloration of the cervix with application of acetic acid solution. Biopsy of this area shows carcinoma-in-situ. Activation of which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of this condition?
Options:
(A): Phosphoprotein p24
(B): JAK2 tyrosine kinase
(C): E2F transcription factors
(D): Phosphoprotein p53
(E): Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors
",E2F transcription factors,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) E2F transcription factors.

Explanation:
Carcinoma-in-situ is a pre-invasive stage of cancer where abnormal cells are present but have not invaded the surrounding tissue. In the context of cervical cancer, it refers to the presence of abnormal cells in the cervical epithelium. The activation of E2F transcription factors best explains the pathogenesis of this condition.

E2F transcription factors are a family of proteins that regulate the cell cycle and play a crucial role in cell proliferation. They control the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, DNA replication, and cell division. In normal cells, E2F transcription factors are tightly regulated to ensure proper cell cycle control.

However, in the case of cervical cancer, there is dysregulation of E2F transcription factors. This dysregulation can be caused by the integration of high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA into the host genome. HPV infection is a major risk factor for the development of cervical cancer.

High-risk HPV types, such as HPV-16 and HPV-18, produce viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which interact with and inactivate tumor suppressor proteins p53 and pRb, respectively. Inactivation of pRb leads to the release of E2F transcription factors, allowing them to promote cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. This dysregulation of E2F transcription factors contributes to the development of carcinoma-in-situ and eventually invasive cervical cancer.

Therefore, the activation of E2F transcription factors best explains the pathogenesis of carcinoma-in-situ in this case.",
"A research group has developed a low-cost diagnostic retinal imaging device for cytomegalovirus retinitis in a population of HIV-infected patients. In a pilot study of 50 patients, the imaging test detected the presence of CMV retinitis in 50% of the patients. An ophthalmologist slit lamp examination, which was performed for each patient to serve as the gold standard for diagnosis, confirmed a diagnosis of CMV retinitis in 20 patients that were found to be positive through imaging, as well as 1 patient who tested negative with the device. If the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population decreases due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy, how will positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic test be affected?
Options:
(A): PPV decreases, NPV decreases
(B): PPV decreases, NPV increases
(C): PPV increases, NPV decreases
(D): PPV increases, NPV increases
(E): PPV unchanged, NPV unchanged
","PPV decreases, NPV increases",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): PPV decreases, NPV increases.

Explanation:
Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability that a positive test result is truly positive, while negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that a negative test result is truly negative.

In this scenario, the prevalence of CMV retinitis in the population is decreasing due to increased access to antiretroviral therapy. As the prevalence decreases, the probability of a positive test result being a true positive also decreases, leading to a decrease in PPV. This is because the number of true positives (20 patients confirmed by slit lamp examination) remains the same, but the total number of positive test results (50% of 50 patients) decreases.

On the other hand, the probability of a negative test result being a true negative increases as the prevalence decreases. This is because the number of true negatives (patients without CMV retinitis) remains the same, but the total number of negative test results (50% of 50 patients) increases. Therefore, NPV increases.

Overall, as the prevalence of CMV retinitis decreases, the positive predictive value of the diagnostic test decreases, while the negative predictive value increases.",
"A 35-year-old woman is brought into the clinic by a concerned neighbor who says that the patient is often seen setting up bear traps all around her property because of an impending ‘invasion of the mole people.’ The patient has come to the clinic wearing a garlic necklace. She vaguely explains that the necklace is to mask her scent from the moles tracking her. She has no past psychiatric history and she denies hearing voices or seeing objects. No significant past medical history. Although she has lived in the same community for years, she says she usually keeps to herself and does not have many friends. She holds a regular job at the local hardware store and lives alone. Which of the following is the best initial course of treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
(B): The patient does not require any intervention
(C): Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
(D): A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy
(E): Refer to outpatient group therapy
",Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),Incorrect,"The correct choice is (D): A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, it is likely that she is experiencing symptoms of a psychotic disorder, such as delusions and paranoid ideation. Her belief in an impending invasion of mole people and her use of a garlic necklace to mask her scent from moles are indicative of a delusional belief system. Additionally, her social isolation and lack of friends may suggest impaired social functioning, which is commonly seen in individuals with psychotic disorders.

Given that the patient has no past psychiatric history and denies hallucinations, it is reasonable to start with a brief trial of antipsychotic therapy as the initial course of treatment. Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for psychotic disorders and can help alleviate symptoms such as delusions and paranoia. A brief trial of antipsychotic therapy will allow for observation of the patient's response to the medication and determine if further treatment is necessary.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be beneficial in the long-term management of psychotic disorders, but it is not the best initial course of treatment in this case. CBT is typically used as an adjunctive therapy to medication and focuses on helping individuals identify and challenge their delusional beliefs. However, medication is usually the first-line treatment for acute psychotic symptoms.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is not indicated in this case. ECT is primarily used for severe depression, bipolar disorder, and treatment-resistant psychosis. It is not the first-line treatment for a patient presenting with delusions and paranoid ideation without severe depressive symptoms.

Referring the patient to outpatient group therapy (option E) may be beneficial for long-term support and socialization, but it is not the best initial course of treatment. Group therapy is typically used as an adjunctive therapy to medication and individual therapy in the management of psychotic disorders.

Therefore, a brief trial of antipsychotic therapy (option D) is the most appropriate initial course of treatment for this patient.",
"A 71-year-old man complains of urinary hesitancy and nocturia of increasing frequency over the past several months. Digital rectal exam was positive for a slightly enlarged prostate but did not detect any additional abnormalities of the prostate or rectum. The patient’s serum PSA was measured to be 6 ng/mL. Image A shows a transabdominal ultrasound of the patient. Which of the following medications should be included to optimally treat the patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Clonidine
(B): Finasteride
(C): Dihydrotestosterone
(D): Diphenhydramine
(E): Furosemide
",Finasteride,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Finasteride.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of urinary hesitancy and nocturia, along with a slightly enlarged prostate on digital rectal exam and a serum PSA level of 6 ng/mL, the most appropriate medication to include in the treatment plan is finasteride.

Finasteride is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that is commonly used in the management of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It works by reducing the size of the prostate gland, which can help alleviate symptoms such as urinary hesitancy and nocturia.

In older men with continued symptoms on an alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist (such as tamsulosin) and who have a prostate larger than 35 g or a PSA greater than 1.5 ng/mL, adding a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor like finasteride is recommended. Treatment with finasteride for four to six months is generally needed before prostate size is sufficiently reduced to improve symptoms.

The efficacy of long-term therapy with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors is limited, but the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) trial demonstrated benefit with finasteride on a combined endpoint of reduction of BPH symptoms, need for intervention for urinary retention, and reduction of urinary symptoms. Combination therapy with finasteride and an alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist (such as doxazosin) was found to be superior to therapy with either single agent.

Therefore, finasteride should be included in the treatment plan for this patient to optimize the management of his urinary symptoms.",
"A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of drowsiness at work for the past several months. He finds his work as a computer programmer rewarding and looks forward to coming into the office every day. However, he often falls asleep during meetings even though he usually gets a good night sleep and has limited his exposure to alcohol and caffeine in the evening. His past medical history is noncontributory. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. The primary care provider recommends keeping a sleep journal and provides a questionnaire for the patient’s wife. The patient returns one month later to report no changes to his condition. The sleep journal reveals that the patient is getting sufficient sleep and wakes up rested. The questionnaire reveals that the patient does not snore nor does he stop breathing during his sleep. A sleep study reveals mean sleep latency of 6 minutes. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Methylphenidate
(B): Sodium oxybate
(C): Imipramine
(D): Increase daytime naps
(E): Changing career
",Methylphenidate,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Methylphenidate.

Explanation:
The patient's complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness, despite getting sufficient sleep at night, along with falling asleep during meetings, suggests a possible diagnosis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), sleep paralysis, and hallucinations. The mean sleep latency of 6 minutes on the sleep study is consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy.

Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant that is commonly used to treat narcolepsy. It works by increasing the release of norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain, which helps to promote wakefulness and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness. Methylphenidate is considered the first-line treatment for narcolepsy and has been shown to be effective in improving wakefulness and reducing daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy.

Sodium oxybate (B) is another medication used to treat narcolepsy, but it is typically reserved for patients with more severe symptoms, such as cataplexy. Imipramine (C) is an antidepressant that may be used to treat narcolepsy in some cases, but it is not considered a first-line treatment. Increasing daytime naps (D) may provide temporary relief of symptoms but is not a long-term solution for excessive daytime sleepiness. Changing career (E) is not necessary unless the patient's symptoms are significantly impacting his ability to perform his current job.",
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The patient reports that he first noticed the swelling several weeks ago, but it is not always present. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. His father was diagnosed with a seminoma at the age of 25 years. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows a 10-cm, soft, cystic, nontender right scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Options:
(A): Patent processus vaginalis
(B): Dilation of the pampiniform plexus
(C): Twisting of the spermatic cord
(D): Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis
(E): Impaired lymphatic drainage
",Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the most likely cause of the painless scrotal swelling in this patient is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis, leading to a hydrocele. A hydrocele is a collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis, which is a serous membrane that covers the testis and lines the scrotal cavity. It can result from an imbalance between fluid secretion and resorption, leading to an accumulation of fluid. The swelling is typically painless, soft, and cystic, and it transilluminates on examination. The absence of bowel sounds in the mass and the fact that it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position further support the diagnosis of a hydrocele. 

The other options are less likely based on the information provided:
(A) Patent processus vaginalis: A patent processus vaginalis is a congenital condition in which the processus vaginalis, a tubular outpouching of the peritoneum, fails to close. This can lead to the development of an indirect inguinal hernia, but it is less likely to present as a painless scrotal swelling.
(B) Dilation of the pampiniform plexus: Dilation of the pampiniform plexus, known as a varicocele, is a common cause of scrotal swelling in men. However, varicoceles are typically described as a ""bag of worms"" and are more commonly seen on the left side. They are also more likely to be associated with a dragging sensation or discomfort, which is not described in this patient.
(C) Twisting of the spermatic cord: Twisting of the spermatic cord, known as testicular torsion, is a surgical emergency that presents with sudden-onset severe testicular pain, swelling, and tenderness. It is unlikely in this patient given the absence of pain and tenderness.
(E) Impaired lymphatic drainage: Impaired lymphatic drainage can lead to lymphedema, but it is less likely to present as a painless scrotal swelling. Additionally, lymphedema is typically associated with other signs of lymphatic obstruction, such as swelling in other parts of the body.",
"A 62-year-old man presents to the physician because of incomplete healing of a chest wound. He recently had a triple coronary artery bypass graft 3 weeks ago. His past medical history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension for the past 25 years. Clinical examination shows the presence of wound dehiscence in the lower 3rd of the sternal region. The wound surface shows the presence of dead necrotic tissue with pus. Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax shows a small fluid collection with fat stranding in the perisurgical soft tissues. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient?
Options:
(A): Surgical debridement
(B): Negative pressure wound management
(C): Sternal dressings
(D): Sternal wiring
(E): Sternal fixation
",Surgical debridement,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Surgical debridement.

Explanation:
In this patient with wound dehiscence and signs of infection, the most appropriate next step in management is surgical debridement. Surgical debridement is the mainstay of therapy for postoperative sternal wound complications, such as wound dehiscence and infection. It involves the removal of necrotic tissue and foreign materials from the wound to promote healing and prevent further infection. Following debridement, the sternum can be closed immediately or managed with open wound management, depending on patient and wound-related factors. Surgical debridement is essential in this case to remove the dead necrotic tissue and pus, and to facilitate healing of the wound. Sternal dressings, negative pressure wound management, sternal wiring, and sternal fixation may be considered in certain cases, but surgical debridement is the initial and most appropriate step in managing this patient's condition.",
"The Kozak sequence for the Beta-globin gene has a known mutation which decreases, though does not abolish, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA, leading to a phenotype of thalassemia intermedia. What would the blood smear be expected to show in a patient positive for this mutation?
Options:
(A): Macrocytic red blood cells
(B): Hyperchromic red blood cells
(C): Microcytic red blood cells
(D): Bite cells
(E): Ringed sideroblasts
",Microcytic red blood cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Microcytic red blood cells.

Explanation:
Thalassemia intermedia is a milder form of thalassemia that is characterized by decreased, but not abolished, translation of the Beta-globin mRNA. This leads to a decrease in the production of normal Beta-globin chains, resulting in a phenotype of microcytic red blood cells. Microcytic red blood cells are smaller in size than normal red blood cells. This is due to the decreased production of hemoglobin, which is responsible for the red color and size of the red blood cells. Therefore, on a blood smear, a patient positive for this mutation would be expected to show microcytic red blood cells.",
"A 68-year-old man from California presents for a routine checkup. He does not have any complaints. He says that he has tried to keep himself healthy and active by jogging and gardening since his retirement at age 50. He adds that he spends his mornings in the park and his afternoons in his garden. He has no significant medical history. The patient denies any smoking history and drinks alcohol occasionally. On physical examination, the following lesion is seen on his scalp (see image). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Psoriasis
(B): Seborrheic keratosis
(C): Basal cell carcinoma
(D): Actinic keratosis
(E): Squamous cell carcinoma
",Actinic keratosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Actinic keratosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of spending a significant amount of time outdoors, particularly in the park and garden, and his age, the most likely diagnosis for the lesion on his scalp is actinic keratosis. Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin condition that is caused by long-term sun exposure. It typically presents as rough, scaly patches or lesions on sun-exposed areas such as the scalp, face, and hands. The lesion in the image appears as a rough, erythematous patch on the scalp, which is consistent with actinic keratosis.

Psoriasis (A) is an autoimmune skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches that can occur anywhere on the body. It is not typically associated with sun exposure and does not present as a rough, erythematous patch.

Seborrheic keratosis (B) is a benign skin growth that is commonly seen in older individuals. It appears as raised, waxy, and often pigmented lesions. It is not typically associated with sun exposure and does not present as a rough, erythematous patch.

Basal cell carcinoma (C) and squamous cell carcinoma (E) are both types of skin cancer that can be caused by long-term sun exposure. However, the lesion in the image does not have the typical appearance of either of these types of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma usually presents as a pearly, translucent nodule, while squamous cell carcinoma typically presents as a scaly, crusted, or ulcerated lesion.",
"A routine newborn screening test for phenylketonuria in a male neonate shows a serum phenylalanine concentration of 44 mg/dL (N < 20). He is started on a special diet and the hyperphenylalaninemia resolves. At a routine well-child examination 4 months later, the physician notices that he has persistent head lag. On examination, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia. His serum prolactin level is markedly elevated. Supplementation of which of the following substances is most likely to prevent further complications of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Tyrosine
(B): Pyridoxine
(C): Thiamine
(D): Tetrahydrobiopterin
(E): Niacin
",Tetrahydrobiopterin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Tetrahydrobiopterin.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario has phenylketonuria (PKU), which is characterized by elevated levels of phenylalanine due to a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Treatment for PKU involves a special diet low in phenylalanine, which helps to normalize phenylalanine levels. However, in some cases, despite adherence to the diet, patients may still experience complications.

The patient in this scenario has persistent head lag, which is a sign of developmental delay. Additionally, he has blue eyes, pale skin, blonde hair, and generalized hypotonia, which are characteristic features of PKU. The markedly elevated serum prolactin level is also consistent with PKU.

Supplementation of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is most likely to prevent further complications in this patient. BH4 is a cofactor required for the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase. In some cases of PKU, the deficiency is not in phenylalanine hydroxylase itself, but in BH4. Supplementation with BH4 can help to restore the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase and normalize phenylalanine levels, preventing further complications.

Tyrosine supplementation (choice A) is not necessary in this patient, as tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that can be synthesized from phenylalanine. Pyridoxine (choice B) and thiamine (choice C) are not indicated in the treatment of PKU. Niacin (choice E) is not directly involved in the metabolism of phenylalanine and would not prevent complications in this patient.",
"A 36-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with the complaints of breathlessness, cough, and night sweats for the past 2 months. She further expresses her concerns about the possibility of contracting tuberculosis as one of the patients under her care is being treated for tuberculosis. A PPD skin test is done and reads 11 mm on day 3. Chest X-ray demonstrates a cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe. The standard anti-tuberculosis medication regimen is started. At a follow-up appointment 3 months later the patient presents with fatigue. She has also been experiencing occasional dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet. Physical exam is positive for conjunctival pallor. Lab work is significant for a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl. What is the most likely cause of her current symptoms?
Options:
(A): Decreased methionine synthesis
(B): Inhibition of ferrochelatase
(C): Increased homocysteine degradation
(D): Increased GABA production
(E): Decreased ALA synthesis
",Decreased ALA synthesis,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Decreased ALA synthesis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, weakness, and numbness in her feet, along with the physical exam finding of conjunctival pallor, are consistent with anemia. The lab work showing a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume of 68 fl further supports the diagnosis of anemia. 

The most likely cause of her anemia is a deficiency in heme synthesis, specifically a decreased synthesis of delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). ALA is a precursor in the heme synthesis pathway, and a deficiency in ALA synthesis can lead to impaired heme production and subsequently, anemia. 

Inhibition of ferrochelatase (choice B) would lead to an accumulation of protoporphyrin, not a deficiency in ALA synthesis. Increased homocysteine degradation (choice C) and increased GABA production (choice D) are not related to heme synthesis and would not cause anemia. Decreased methionine synthesis (choice A) is also not related to heme synthesis and would not cause anemia.",
"A 23-year-old woman is referred to a genetic counselor. She is feeling well but is concerned because her brother was recently diagnosed with hereditary hemochromatosis. All first-degree relatives were encouraged to undergo genetic screening for any mutations associated with the disease. Today, she denies fever, chills, joint pain, or skin hyperpigmentation. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 123/78 mm Hg. Her physical examination is normal. Her serum iron, hemoglobin, ferritin, and AST and ALT concentrations are normal. Gene screening will involve a blood specimen. Which of the following genes would suggest hereditary hemochromatosis?
Options:
(A): BCR-ABL gene
(B): BRCA gene
(C): FA gene
(D): HFE gene
(E): WAS gene
",HFE gene,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) HFE gene.

Explanation:
Hereditary hemochromatosis is almost always caused by a genetic change that is passed from both parents to a child. The HFE gene is the gene associated with hereditary hemochromatosis. Therefore, gene screening for hereditary hemochromatosis would involve testing for mutations in the HFE gene.

The other options are not associated with hereditary hemochromatosis:
(A) BCR-ABL gene is associated with chronic myeloid leukemia.
(B) BRCA gene is associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
(C) FA gene is associated with Fanconi anemia.
(E) WAS gene is associated with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.",
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with constant abdominal pain over the past 8 hours. The pain is in her right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is also where it began. She has had no nausea or vomiting despite eating a snack 2 hours ago. She had a similar episode last month which resolved on its own. Her menstrual cycles are 28–30 days apart with 3–5 days of vaginal bleeding. Her last menses ended 9 days ago. Her blood pressure is 125/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 78/min, the respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Abdominal examination shows moderate pain on direct pressure over the RLQ which decreases with the release of pressure. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.5 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 6000/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 55%
Lymphocytes 39%
Platelet count 260,000/mm3
Serum  
C-reactive protein 5 mg/L (N < 8 mg/L)
Urine  
RBC 1-2 phf
WBC None
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Methotrexate
(B): Nitrofurantoin
(C): Reassurance
(D): Referral for surgery
(E): Tamsulosin
",Reassurance,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Reassurance.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute appendicitis. The pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with the tenderness on direct pressure over the RLQ, suggests inflammation of the appendix. The absence of nausea, vomiting, and fever, as well as the normal laboratory findings, indicate that the condition is likely in the early stages.

Given the patient's age and the absence of severe symptoms or signs of complications, such as peritonitis or abscess formation, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance. It is reasonable to observe the patient closely and provide symptomatic treatment, such as pain management, while monitoring for any worsening of symptoms or development of complications.

Referral for surgery (option D) would be indicated if the patient's symptoms worsen or if there are signs of complications, such as peritonitis or abscess formation. However, at this point, surgery is not the most appropriate initial management.

Methotrexate (option A) is used in the medical management of ectopic pregnancy, not appendicitis. The patient's history and presentation do not suggest an ectopic pregnancy.

Nitrofurantoin (option B) is an antibiotic commonly used for urinary tract infections, but it is not indicated in the management of appendicitis.

Tamsulosin (option E) is an alpha-1 blocker used primarily for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and urinary retention. It is not indicated in the management of appendicitis.",
"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency department with a complaint of abdominal pain. The patient states he was at a barbecue around noon. Lunch was arranged as a buffet without refrigeration. Within 2 to 3 hours, he had abdominal pain with 3 episodes of watery diarrhea. On exam, vital signs are T 99.1, HR 103, BP 110/55, RR 14. Abdominal exam is significant for pain to deep palpation without any rebounding or guarding. There is no blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT). What is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): Salmonella enteritidis
(B): Listeria monocytogenes
(C): Staphylococcus aureus
(D): Campylobacter jejuni
(E): Vibrio cholerae
",Staphylococcus aureus,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Staphylococcus aureus.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely cause of his symptoms is Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of food poisoning and is often associated with foods that are prepared and left at room temperature for an extended period of time, such as buffets without refrigeration.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea within a few hours of consuming the food are consistent with the rapid onset of symptoms seen in Staphylococcus aureus food poisoning. The absence of blood on fecal occult testing (FOBT) suggests that there is no significant inflammation or damage to the gastrointestinal tract.

Other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and the timing of his symptoms. Salmonella enteritidis and Campylobacter jejuni infections typically have a longer incubation period before symptoms develop, usually 1-3 days. Listeria monocytogenes infection is more commonly associated with symptoms in pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. Vibrio cholerae infection typically presents with profuse watery diarrhea and can be associated with recent travel to endemic areas or consumption of contaminated seafood.

Therefore, Staphylococcus aureus is the most likely cause of this patient's presentation based on the timing of symptoms, absence of blood on FOBT, and the association with a buffet without refrigeration.",
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by staff of the group home where he resides because of worsening confusion for the past week. He has a history of major depressive disorder and had an ischemic stroke 4 months ago. Current medications are aspirin and sertraline. He is lethargic and disoriented. His pulse is 78/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows moist oral mucosa, normal skin turgor, and no peripheral edema. While in the waiting room, he has a generalized, tonic-clonic seizure. Laboratory studies show a serum sodium of 119 mEq/L and an elevated serum antidiuretic hormone concentration. Which of the following sets of additional laboratory findings is most likely in this patient?
 $$$ Serum osmolality %%% Urine sodium %%% Serum aldosterone $$$
Options:
(A): ↑ normal normal
(B): ↓ ↓ ↓
(C): ↑ ↓ normal
(D): ↓ ↑ ↑
(E): ↓ ↑ ↓
",↓ ↑ ↓,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (D): ↓ ↑ ↑

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is characterized by euvolemic hyponatremia, elevated urine osmolality, and inappropriately elevated levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In SIADH, there is excessive release of ADH, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. The most common cause of SIADH is medication effect, and this patient's use of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is a likely cause. SSRIs have been associated with SIADH due to their effect on increasing ADH release. 

In SIADH, the serum osmolality is low, reflecting the dilutional effect of the excess water. The urine sodium concentration is typically elevated (>40 mEq/L) due to the kidneys' inability to excrete sodium in the presence of high levels of ADH. The serum aldosterone concentration is typically elevated as well, as the body tries to compensate for the hyponatremia by increasing sodium reabsorption. Therefore, the correct set of additional laboratory findings in this patient is: ↓ ↑ ↑.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents with severe fear reactions to seeing dogs after moving into a new suburban neighborhood. She states that she has always had an irrational and excessive fear of dogs but has been able to avoid it for most of her life while living in the city. When she sees her neighbors walking their dogs outside, she is terrified and begins to feel short of breath. Recently, she has stopped picking up her children from the bus stop and no longer plays outside with her children in order to avoid seeing any dogs. Which of the following would be the best definitive treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)
(B): Short-acting benzodiazepines
(C): Systematic desensitization
(D): Cognitive behavioral therapy
(E): Dialectical behavioral therapy
",Systematic desensitization,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Systematic desensitization.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is experiencing a specific phobia, which is an excessive and irrational fear of a specific object or situation. In this case, the patient has a fear of dogs. The best definitive treatment for specific phobias is systematic desensitization.

Systematic desensitization is a form of exposure therapy that involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled and safe manner. The goal is to reduce the fear response through repeated exposure and relaxation techniques. In this case, the patient would be gradually exposed to dogs, starting with less anxiety-provoking situations and gradually progressing to more challenging situations.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and short-acting benzodiazepines may be effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, but they are not considered the best definitive treatment for specific phobias. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is also effective for specific phobias, but systematic desensitization is a specific type of CBT that is more appropriate for this particular phobia. Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) is not typically used for specific phobias and is more commonly used for borderline personality disorder.

Therefore, the best definitive treatment for this patient's specific phobia of dogs would be systematic desensitization.",
"A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death?
Options:
(A): Diffuse alveolar damage
(B): Ventricular septal defect
(C): Myocardial free wall rupture
(D): Papillary muscle rupture
(E): Myocardial reinfarction
",Diffuse alveolar damage,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Diffuse alveolar damage.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely direct cause of the patient's death is diffuse alveolar damage. Diffuse alveolar damage is a severe form of acute lung injury characterized by damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory failure.

In this case, the patient had a severe construction accident with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen. He underwent surgery to remove the foreign body and control bleeding, during which he experienced an acute drop in blood pressure and ST elevations on ECG. These findings suggest that the patient experienced significant cardiovascular compromise, likely due to hypovolemic shock from the injury.

Following surgery, the patient remained sedated and had relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit when he experienced oxygen desaturation despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen. On auscultation, crackles were heard, indicating the presence of fluid in the lungs. The Swan-Ganz catheter readings showed normal pressures in the central venous, right ventricular, and pulmonary artery, suggesting that the cause of the oxygen desaturation was not related to cardiac dysfunction.

The chest x-ray shown in Image A demonstrates diffuse bilateral infiltrates, which are consistent with pulmonary edema. The presence of crackles on auscultation further supports the diagnosis of pulmonary edema. The combination of oxygen desaturation, crackles, and pulmonary edema suggests that the patient developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to diffuse alveolar damage.

Diffuse alveolar damage is a severe form of lung injury that can occur as a result of various insults, including trauma, sepsis, aspiration, and inhalation injury. It is characterized by damage to the alveolar-capillary membrane, leading to increased permeability and the accumulation of protein-rich fluid in the alveoli. This impairs gas exchange and can result in severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure.

In this case, the patient likely developed diffuse alveolar damage as a consequence of the initial trauma and subsequent surgery. The acute drop in blood pressure during surgery may have contributed to the development of diffuse alveolar damage by causing systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The resulting increase in vascular permeability leads to the accumulation of fluid in the alveoli, causing pulmonary edema and impaired gas exchange.

Despite efforts to manage the patient's condition, including fluid resuscitation and blood transfusions, the development of diffuse alveolar damage ultimately led to respiratory failure and death.",
"A 76-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presents complaining of 3 weeks of cough and progressive dyspnea on exertion in the setting of a 20 pound weight loss. He is a 60 pack-year smoker, worked as a shipbuilder 30 years ago, and recently traveled to Ohio to visit family. Chest radiograph shows increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and multiple pleural plaques. Labs are unremarkable except for a slight anemia. Which of the following is the most likely finding on this patient's chest CT?
Options:
(A): Nodular mass spreading along pleural surfaces
(B): Honeycombing
(C): Air bronchogram
(D): Granulomatous nodule
(E): Lower lobe cavitary mass
",Lower lobe cavitary mass,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Lower lobe cavitary mass.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, as well as the findings on the chest radiograph, the most likely finding on this patient's chest CT is a lower lobe cavitary mass. 

The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking history, and occupational exposure as a shipbuilder suggest a high risk for developing lung cancer. The patient's symptoms of cough, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss are concerning for a malignant process. 

The chest radiograph findings of increased bronchovascular markings, reticular parenchymal opacities, and multiple pleural plaques are consistent with the diagnosis of asbestosis, which is commonly seen in shipbuilders due to exposure to asbestos. Asbestosis is a risk factor for developing lung cancer.

A lower lobe cavitary mass on the chest CT is a common finding in lung cancer. The cavitary nature of the mass suggests necrosis or cavitation within the tumor. This finding is often seen in advanced or aggressive lung cancers.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's history and symptoms. A nodular mass spreading along pleural surfaces is not consistent with the findings of multiple pleural plaques on the chest radiograph. Honeycombing is typically seen in interstitial lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which does not fit with the patient's history and symptoms. An air bronchogram is a radiographic finding seen in conditions such as pneumonia or bronchiectasis, which are less likely in this patient. A granulomatous nodule is more commonly seen in conditions such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, which do not fit with the patient's history and symptoms.",
"A 60-year-old man presents with a 2-day history of increasing difficulty in breathing with a productive cough. He reports having shortness of breath over the last 6 months, but he has felt worse since he contracted a cold that has been traveling around his office. Today, he reports body aches, headache, and fever along with this chronic cough. His past medical history is significant for prediabetes, which he controls with exercise and diet. He has a 30-pack-year smoking history. His blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse rate is 90/min, temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), and respiratory rate is 18/min. Physical examination reveals diminished breath sounds bilateral, a barrel-shaped chest, and measured breathing through pursed lips. A chest X-ray reveals a flattened diaphragm and no signs of consolidation. Pulmonary function testing reveals FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%. Arterial blood gases (ABG) of this patient are most likely to reveal which of the following?
Options:
(A): Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
(B): Primary respiratory acidosis
(C): Primary respiratory alkalosis
(D): Compensatory respiratory acidosis
(E): Anion gap metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalosis
",Primary respiratory acidosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Primary respiratory acidosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is likely that he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The chronic cough, shortness of breath, barrel-shaped chest, and pursed lip breathing are all consistent with COPD. The diminished breath sounds bilateral and flattened diaphragm on chest X-ray further support this diagnosis.

In COPD, the airways become narrowed and the lungs lose their elasticity, leading to difficulty in exhaling air. This results in air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs, which can be seen on physical examination as a barrel-shaped chest. The decreased breath sounds are due to the decreased airflow through the narrowed airways.

The pulmonary function testing reveals a FEV1/FVC ratio of 60%, which is decreased. This indicates airflow limitation and confirms the diagnosis of COPD.

In COPD exacerbations, there is an acute worsening of symptoms, often triggered by an infection such as a cold. The patient's body aches, headache, and fever are consistent with an acute respiratory infection.

Arterial blood gases (ABG) are used to assess the acid-base status of the patient. In primary respiratory acidosis, there is an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood due to impaired ventilation. This is seen in COPD exacerbations, as the patient's ability to exhale air is compromised. The increased CO2 levels lead to respiratory acidosis.

Therefore, the ABG of this patient is most likely to reveal primary respiratory acidosis.",
"A 34-year-old male suffers from inherited hemophilia A. He and his wife have three unaffected daughters. What is the probability that the second daughter is a carrier of the disease?
Options:
(A): 0%
(B): 25%
(C): 50%
(D): 75%
(E): 100%
",100%,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (C) 50%.

Explanation:
Inherited hemophilia A is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that affected males have one copy of the mutated gene on their X chromosome, while females need to have two copies of the mutated gene to be affected. 

In this case, the 34-year-old male with hemophilia A will pass on his affected X chromosome to all of his daughters, as they receive one X chromosome from him. Therefore, all of his daughters will be carriers of the disease.

Since the couple has three daughters, the probability that the second daughter is a carrier is 100%, as all of the daughters are carriers. Therefore, the correct answer is 50%.",
"A 76-year-old man is brought to his physician's office by his wife due to progressively worsening hearing loss. The patient reports that he noticed a decrease in his hearing approximately 10 years ago. His wife says that he watches television at an elevated volume and appears to have trouble understanding what is being said to him, especially when there is background noise. He states that he also experiences constant ear ringing and episodes of unsteadiness. On physical examination, the outer ears are normal and otoscopic findings are unremarkable. The patient is unable to repeat the sentence said to him on whisper testing. When a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the middle of the patient's forehead, it is heard equally on both ears. When the vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, air conduction is greater than bone conduction. Which of the following structures is most likely impaired in this patient?
Options:
(A): Tympanic membrane
(B): Malleus
(C): Incus
(D): Stapes
(E): Cochlea
",Cochlea,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Cochlea.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on physical examination, the most likely structure impaired in this patient is the cochlea. The patient has a history of progressively worsening hearing loss over the past 10 years, which is consistent with sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is typically caused by damage to the cochlea or the auditory nerve.

The patient also reports constant ear ringing (tinnitus) and episodes of unsteadiness, which are common symptoms associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Additionally, on physical examination, the otoscopic findings are unremarkable, ruling out any abnormalities in the outer ear or tympanic membrane.

The Weber test, in which a vibrating tuning fork is placed on the forehead, is heard equally on both ears. This indicates that there is no significant asymmetry in hearing between the two ears, suggesting that the impairment is not due to a conductive hearing loss involving the middle ear structures (tympanic membrane, malleus, incus, or stapes).

Furthermore, the Rinne test, in which a vibrating tuning fork is placed by the ear and then on the mastoid process, reveals that air conduction is greater than bone conduction. This finding is consistent with sensorineural hearing loss, as both air and bone conduction may be quantitatively decreased, but air conduction remains better than bone conduction.

Therefore, the most likely structure impaired in this patient is the cochlea, leading to sensorineural hearing loss.",
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a 6-hour history of severe eye pain and blurry vision. He wears soft contact lenses and has not removed them for 2 days. Ophthalmologic examination shows a deep corneal ulcer, severe conjunctival injection, and purulent discharge on the right. Treatment with topical ciprofloxacin is initiated. A culture of the ocular discharge is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Gram-negative, non-maltose fermenting diplococci
(B): Gram-positive, bacitracin-sensitive cocci
(C): Gram-negative, lactose-fermenting bacilli
(D): Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli
(E): Gram-positive, optochin-sensitive diplococci
""
","Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli",Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation of a deep corneal ulcer, severe conjunctival injection, and purulent discharge, along with the patient's history of wearing soft contact lenses and not removing them for 2 days, the most likely pathogen causing the infection is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacillus that is a common cause of severe keratitis in individuals who wear contact lenses. It is known to cause a particularly virulent keratitis and is especially common in contact lens wearers. Treatment with topical ciprofloxacin, which is effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was initiated. Therefore, a culture of the ocular discharge is most likely to show Gram-negative, oxidase-positive bacilli, which is consistent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",
"A 31-year-old female patient complains of numbness and tingling in her left hand, weakness, difficulty with walking, dizziness, and bladder dysfunction. She said that about a year ago, she had trouble with her vision, and that it eventually recovered in a few days. On physical exam, bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia, hyperreflexia in both patella, and bilateral clonus, are noted. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study was done (Figure 1). If a lumbar puncture is performed in this patient, which of the following would most likely be found in cerebrospinal fluid analysis?
Options:
(A): Presence of 14-3-3 protein
(B): Decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance
(C): Oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis
(D): Decreased IgG CSF concentration
(E): Albuminocytologic dissociation
",Oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and history of previous vision trouble are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system. A lumbar puncture is often performed in the diagnostic workup of MS to analyze the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

In MS, CSF analysis typically shows oligoclonal IgG bands on electrophoresis. These bands represent the presence of antibodies produced by the immune system within the central nervous system. The presence of these bands is a strong indicator of an inflammatory process in the CNS, such as MS.

The other options are not typically seen in MS:
(A) Presence of 14-3-3 protein: This protein is associated with certain neurodegenerative disorders, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but not MS.
(B) Decreased glucose with neutrophilic predominance: This pattern is seen in bacterial meningitis, not MS.
(D) Decreased IgG CSF concentration: In MS, there is often an increased concentration of IgG in the CSF, not a decreased concentration.
(E) Albuminocytologic dissociation: This term refers to an elevated protein level in the CSF without an increase in white blood cells. It is seen in conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, but not MS.",
"A 22-year-old primigravida presents for a regular prenatal visit at 16 weeks gestation. She is concerned about the results of a dipstick test she performed at home, which showed 1+ glucose. She does not know  if her liquid consumption has increased, but she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. The BMI is 25.6 kg/cm2 and she has gained 3 kg (6.72 lb) during the pregnancy. The blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, and the temperature is 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The lungs are clear to auscultation, the heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and there is no abdominal or costovertebral angle tenderness. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Fasting glucose 97 mg/L
ALT 12 IU/L
AST 14 IU/L
Total bilirubin 0.8 mg/dL(15 µmol/L)
Plasma creatinine 0.7 mg/dL (61.9 µmol/L)
Which of the following tests are indicated to determine the cause of the abnormal dipstick test results?
Options:
(A): HbA1c measurement
(B): No tests required
(C): Urinalysis
(D): Oral glucose tolerance test
(E): Random plasma glucose
",No tests required,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) No tests required.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is a 22-year-old primigravida at 16 weeks gestation. She performed a dipstick test at home which showed 1+ glucose. However, she does not know if her liquid consumption has increased and she urinates more frequently than before. The course of her pregnancy has been unremarkable and she has no significant co-morbidities. Her blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature are within normal limits. The laboratory tests also show normal fasting glucose levels, liver function tests, bilirubin levels, and plasma creatinine levels.

Given the absence of any other concerning symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, no further tests are indicated at this time. The presence of 1+ glucose on a dipstick test can be a normal finding in pregnancy, especially if the patient's liquid consumption has increased. It is important to note that dipstick tests for glucose can have false-positive results, and further confirmatory testing is not necessary in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is (B) No tests required.",
"A 9-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of intermittent watery diarrhea for several months. Pregnancy and delivery were uncomplicated. He was diagnosed with eczematous dermatitis at 3 months old. His height and weight are below the 5th percentile. Immunologic evaluation shows a defect in activated regulatory T cells. A genetic analysis shows a mutation in the FOXP3 gene. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?
Options:
(A): Hemorrhagic diathesis
(B): Ocular telangiectasias
(C): Autoimmune endocrinopathy
(D): Retained primary teeth
(E): Anaphylaxis to blood transfusions
",Autoimmune endocrinopathy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Autoimmune endocrinopathy.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario has a defect in activated regulatory T cells and a mutation in the FOXP3 gene. This combination of findings is consistent with a diagnosis of immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. IPEX syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males and is characterized by autoimmune dysfunction. 

Patients with IPEX syndrome are at increased risk for developing autoimmune endocrinopathies, such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and adrenal insufficiency. These endocrinopathies can present with symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and electrolyte abnormalities. 

The other options listed are not typically associated with IPEX syndrome. Hemorrhagic diathesis (option A) refers to a tendency to bleed excessively, which is not a characteristic feature of IPEX syndrome. Ocular telangiectasias (option B) are dilated blood vessels in the eyes and are not typically seen in IPEX syndrome. Retained primary teeth (option D) refers to the failure of primary teeth to fall out and be replaced by permanent teeth, which is not associated with IPEX syndrome. Anaphylaxis to blood transfusions (option E) is a severe allergic reaction to blood transfusions and is not a feature of IPEX syndrome.",
"A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of abdominal bloating and increased frequency of stools. He describes the stools as bulky, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. He also has a 4-month history of recurrent dull upper abdominal pain that usually lasts for a few days, worsens after meals, and is not relieved with antacids. He has had a 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss in the past 4 months. He has no personal or family history of serious illness. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 37 years. He has a 12-year history of drinking 6 to 8 beers daily. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 52 kg (115 lb); BMI is 20 kg/m2. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding. Bowel sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Abdominal CT scan
(B): Endoscopic ultrasonography
(C): Abdominal ultrasound
(D): Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
(E): Abdominal x-ray
",Abdominal CT scan,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Abdominal CT scan.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is pancreatic cancer. The patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating, increased frequency of stools, bulky and foul-smelling stools, and weight loss are consistent with pancreatic cancer. The recurrent dull upper abdominal pain that worsens after meals and is not relieved with antacids is also suggestive of pancreatic cancer.

To further evaluate the patient, an abdominal CT scan is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis. CT scan is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating pancreatic cancer. It can provide detailed images of the pancreas and surrounding structures, allowing for the detection of tumors and assessment of their size, location, and involvement of nearby structures.

Measurement of serum cancer antigen 19-9 (Option B) is a tumor marker that can be elevated in pancreatic cancer, but it is not specific for this condition and can also be elevated in other gastrointestinal malignancies and non-malignant conditions. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.

Endoscopic ultrasonography (Option C) is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating pancreatic cancer, as it can provide detailed images of the pancreas and surrounding structures. However, it is an invasive procedure and is typically used after a CT scan has been performed to further evaluate suspicious findings. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.

Abdominal ultrasound (Option D) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be used to evaluate the pancreas. However, it has limited sensitivity and specificity for detecting pancreatic tumors compared to CT scan. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (Option E) is a procedure used to evaluate the upper gastrointestinal tract, including the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis for pancreatic cancer, as it does not directly evaluate the pancreas.

Abdominal x-ray (Option G) is not a useful imaging modality for evaluating pancreatic cancer, as it does not provide detailed images of the pancreas. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosis.",
"A 67-year-old white man presents to his primary care provider for an annual examination. He notes a pink bump that has rapidly developed on his forehead over the last month. In the past, he has had significant sun exposure including multiple blistering sunburns. The physical examination reveals a 2 cm dome-shaped plaque with a central keratin plug (as shown in the image). Excisional biopsy of the lesion reveals an exophytic nodule with central invagination, full of keratin. Keratinocyte atypia is minimal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Keratoacanthoma
(B): Basal cell carcinoma
(C): Seborrheic keratosis
(D): Molluscum contagiosum
(E): Kaposi's sarcoma
",Keratoacanthoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Keratoacanthoma.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is keratoacanthoma (KA). KA is a rapidly growing, dome-shaped papule or nodule with a central keratin plug. It is commonly seen in individuals with a history of significant sun exposure, such as this patient who has had multiple blistering sunburns. The lesion typically reaches 1 to 2 cm in diameter.

Histologically, KA resembles squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), but with minimal keratinocyte atypia. It is important to note that although the majority of KAs are benign and resolve spontaneously, they do have the potential for invasion and metastasis, so treatment is required.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and histological findings:
- Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) typically presents as a pearly papule or nodule with telangiectasias and a rolled border. It does not have a central keratin plug.
- Seborrheic keratosis (SK) is a benign, pigmented lesion that typically appears as a stuck-on, waxy plaque. It does not have a central keratin plug.
- Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection characterized by flesh-colored, dome-shaped papules with a central umbilication. It does not have a central keratin plug.
- Kaposi's sarcoma is a vascular tumor that typically presents as purplish macules, papules, or nodules. It is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. It does not have a central keratin plug.",
"A 56-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with intermittent chest pain. He reports a 2-month history of exertional chest pain that commonly arises after walking 5 or more blocks. He describes the pain as dull, burning, non-radiating substernal pain. His past medical history is notable for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He takes simvastatin and losartan. His temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 150/85 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, he is well-appearing and in no acute distress. S1 and S2 are normal. No murmurs are noted. An exercise stress test is performed to further evaluate the patient’s pain. Which of the following substances is released locally to increase coronary blood flow during exertion?
Options:
(A): Adenosine
(B): Inorganic phosphate
(C): Norepinephrine
(D): Prostaglandin E2
(E): Transforming growth factor beta
",Adenosine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Adenosine.

During exertion, the demand for oxygen and nutrients by the myocardium increases. To meet this increased demand, the coronary blood flow needs to be increased. Adenosine is released locally in response to increased metabolic demand and acts as a potent vasodilator in the coronary arteries. It relaxes the smooth muscle in the walls of the coronary arteries, leading to increased blood flow to the myocardium. Adenosine also has antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effects, which further contribute to the improvement of coronary blood flow.

Inorganic phosphate (B) is not involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow during exertion.

Norepinephrine (C) is a sympathetic neurotransmitter that can cause vasoconstriction in the coronary arteries. It is released during stress or exercise to increase heart rate and contractility, but it does not directly increase coronary blood flow.

Prostaglandin E2 (D) is involved in various physiological processes, but it is not a major regulator of coronary blood flow during exertion.

Transforming growth factor beta (E) is a cytokine involved in cell growth and differentiation, but it is not directly involved in the regulation of coronary blood flow during exertion.",
"A 69-year-old male with a history of metastatic small cell lung carcinoma on chemotherapy presents to his oncologist for a follow-up visit. He has responded well to etoposide and cisplatin with plans to undergo radiation therapy. However, he reports that he recently developed multiple “spots” all over his body. He denies any overt bleeding from his gums or joint swelling. His past medical history is notable for iron deficiency anemia, osteoarthritis, and paraneoplastic Lambert-Eaton syndrome. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, a rash is noted diffusely across the patient’s trunk and bilateral upper and lower extremities.

Results from a complete blood count are shown below:
Hemoglobin: 11.9 mg/dl
Hematocrit: 35%
Leukocyte count: 5,000/mm^3
Platelet count: 20,000/mm^3

The oncologist would like to continue chemotherapy but is concerned that the above results will limit the optimal dose and frequency of the regimen. A recombinant version of which of the following is most appropriate in this patient?
Options:
(A): Interleukin 2
(B): Interleukin 8
(C): Interleukin 11
(D): Erythropoietin
(E): Granulocyte colony stimulating factor
",Interleukin 11,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Interleukin 11.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has developed a rash and has low platelet count (20,000/mm^3), which is known as thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia is a common side effect of chemotherapy and can limit the optimal dose and frequency of chemotherapy regimens. Interleukin 11 (IL-11) is a recombinant cytokine that stimulates the production of platelets and can be used to treat thrombocytopenia. IL-11 acts on megakaryocytes, the precursor cells of platelets, to increase their production and release. By increasing platelet production, IL-11 can help prevent or manage chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia and allow for the continuation of chemotherapy at the optimal dose and frequency. Therefore, IL-11 is the most appropriate recombinant cytokine for this patient.",
"A 60-year-old man with a history of osteoarthritis has been awaiting hip replacement surgery for 3 years. During his annual physical, he reports that he has been taking over the counter pain medications, but that no amount of analgesics can relieve his constant pain. Laboratory results reveal that his renal function has deteriorated when compared to his last office visit 2 years ago. Serum creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, and urinalysis shows 1+ proteinuria. There are no abnormalities seen on microscopy of the urine. A renal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function?
Options:
(A): Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(B): Ischemic acute tubular necrosis
(C): Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis
(D): Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis
(E): Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
",Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis.

Explanation:
Toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most likely explanation for this patient's deterioration in renal function. The patient's history of taking over the counter pain medications, along with the presence of eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation on renal biopsy, suggests a drug-induced injury to the kidneys. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used for pain relief in osteoarthritis, can cause toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis. The presence of proteinuria and the absence of abnormalities on urine microscopy suggest that the glomeruli are not primarily affected, making options A (Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) and E (Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis) less likely. Ischemic acute tubular necrosis (option B) typically occurs in the setting of decreased renal perfusion, such as hypotension or renal artery stenosis, which is not described in this patient. Nephrotoxic acute tubular necrosis (option C) is a possibility, but the presence of eosinophilic infiltration and diffuse parenchymal inflammation on renal biopsy suggests a more specific diagnosis of toxic tubulointerstitial nephritis.",
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient says he feels as if he is unable to take a deep breath. The patient has a past medical history of COPD and a 44-pack-year smoking history. The patient has been admitted before for a similar presentation. His temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 177/118 mmHg, pulse is 123/min, respirations are 33/min, and oxygen saturation is 80% on room air. The patient is started on 100% oxygen, albuterol, ipratropium, magnesium, and prednisone. The patient claims he is still short of breath. Physical exam reveals bilateral wheezes and poor air movement. His oxygen saturation is 80%. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): BiPAP
(B): Chest radiograph
(C): Chest tube placement
(D): Intubation
(E): Needle decompression
",BiPAP,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) BiPAP.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of COPD and acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, the best next step in management is BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure). BiPAP is a non-invasive ventilation technique that provides positive pressure support during both inspiration and expiration. It helps to improve oxygenation and ventilation in patients with respiratory distress. 

The patient's presentation with bilateral wheezes, poor air movement, and low oxygen saturation suggests severe respiratory distress. The initial treatment with 100% oxygen, bronchodilators (albuterol and ipratropium), magnesium, and corticosteroids (prednisone) has not adequately improved the patient's symptoms. BiPAP can provide additional support to the patient's breathing and help to alleviate the shortness of breath.

Chest radiograph (B) may be useful to evaluate for other causes of respiratory distress, such as pneumonia or pneumothorax, but it is not the best next step in management for this patient.

Chest tube placement (C) is indicated for the treatment of a pneumothorax, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a pneumothorax based on the given information.

Intubation (D) and needle decompression (E) are invasive procedures that are not indicated in this patient with COPD exacerbation and no evidence of tension pneumothorax.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is BiPAP (A).",
"A 76-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of low back pain and weakness for the past 4 weeks. He says that the pain is sharp, radiates to his left side, and has a burning quality. He has had a cough occasionally productive of blood-streaked sputum for the past 2 months. He has had 3.2-kg (7.0-lb) weight loss in that time. He is now unable to walk without assistance and has had constipation and difficulty urinating for the past 2 weeks. He has hypertension treated with enalapril. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 60 years. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 150/80 mm Hg. He is oriented to person, place, and time. Neurologic examination shows 3/5 strength of the lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are hyperreflexive. Babinski sign is present bilaterally. Sensory examination shows decreased sensation to pinprick below the T4 dermatome. He is unable to lie recumbent due to severe pain. An x-ray of the chest shows multiple round opacities of varying sizes in both lungs. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Radiation therapy
(B): Intravenous dexamethasone therapy
(C): Intravenous acyclovir therapy
(D): Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy
(E): Oral ibuprofen therapy
""
",Intravenous dexamethasone therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Intravenous dexamethasone therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is spinal cord compression due to metastatic disease. The patient's low back pain, weakness, and sensory deficits below the T4 dermatome are consistent with spinal cord involvement. The presence of multiple round opacities on the chest x-ray suggests metastatic lung cancer as the primary source of the spinal cord compression.

Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord, relieving symptoms and potentially preventing further neurologic damage. It is the initial treatment of choice for patients with suspected spinal cord compression.

Radiation therapy is also an important treatment modality for spinal cord compression, but it is typically initiated after the patient has received dexamethasone to reduce the risk of neurologic deterioration during the treatment planning and initiation process.

Intravenous acyclovir therapy is used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus, but it is not indicated in this patient with suspected spinal cord compression.

Intravenous ceftriaxone and azithromycin therapy is used to treat bacterial infections, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has an infection requiring antibiotic treatment.

Oral ibuprofen therapy may provide some pain relief, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient with suspected spinal cord compression. Intravenous dexamethasone therapy is the preferred initial treatment to reduce inflammation and edema around the spinal cord.",
"A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Alprazolam
(B): Cognitive behavioral therapy
(C): Fluoxetine
(D): Psychodynamic psychotherapy
(E): Zolpidem
",Cognitive behavioral therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Cognitive behavioral therapy.

Explanation:
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best therapy for the patient's condition of fear of flying. CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It is effective in treating anxiety disorders, including specific phobias like fear of flying.

In this case, the patient has been avoiding flying for many years due to a traumatic experience during a flight. He recognizes that his fear is irrational and is distressed by the impact it is having on his life and relationships. CBT can help him challenge and change his negative thoughts and beliefs about flying, and develop coping strategies to manage his anxiety.

CBT for specific phobias typically involves exposure therapy, where the patient gradually and safely confronts their fear in a controlled and supportive environment. This can be done through virtual reality exposure (VRE) or imaginal exposure, where the patient imagines being in a feared situation. The goal is to desensitize the patient to the feared stimulus and reduce their anxiety response.

Medications like alprazolam (a benzodiazepine) or fluoxetine (an antidepressant) may be used in some cases to manage symptoms of anxiety, but they are not the first-line treatment for specific phobias. Benzodiazepines like alprazolam can be used short-term for patients who cannot tolerate exposure therapy, but they can have side effects and the use of medication may undermine the efficacy of CBT.

Zolpidem is a sedative-hypnotic medication used for insomnia and is not indicated for the treatment of specific phobias.

Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on exploring unconscious conflicts and childhood experiences, and is not the recommended treatment for specific phobias.",
"A 75-year-old man presents to a medical clinic for evaluation of a large, tense, pruritic bulla on his inner thighs, abdomen, and lower abdomen. A skin biopsy is performed, which shows an epidermal basement membrane with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence. Which of the following is the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind?
Options:
(A): Adherens junctions
(B): Desmosomes
(C): Gap junctions
(D): Hemidesmosomes
(E): Tight junctions
",Hemidesmosomes,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Hemidesmosomes.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and linear immunofluorescence at the epidermal basement membrane suggests a condition called bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the binding of IgG antibodies to hemidesmosomes.

Hemidesmosomes are cell junctions that anchor the basal layer of the epidermis to the underlying basement membrane. They play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the skin. In bullous pemphigoid, autoantibodies target the hemidesmosomal proteins, leading to the formation of blisters.

Therefore, the most likely cell junction to which the antibodies bind in this case is hemidesmosomes.",
"A 16-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her father because of concerns about her behavior during the past 2 years. She does not have friends and spends most of the time reading by herself. Her father says that she comes up with excuses to avoid family dinners and other social events. She states that she likes reading and feels more comfortable on her own. On mental status examination, her thought process is organized and logical. Her affect is flat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Schizoid personality disorder
(B): Schizotypal personality disorder
(C): Antisocial personality disorder
(D): Schizophreniform disorder
(E): Autism spectrum disorder
",Schizoid personality disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Schizoid personality disorder.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario displays several key features of schizoid personality disorder. Schizoid personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of emotional expression. Individuals with this disorder often prefer solitary activities and have little interest in forming close relationships. They may appear indifferent to praise or criticism and have a limited range of emotional expression, as seen in this patient's flat affect. The patient's preference for reading and avoidance of social events are consistent with the avoidance of social relationships seen in schizoid personality disorder. The absence of other symptoms such as odd beliefs or perceptual disturbances rules out schizotypal personality disorder and schizophreniform disorder. Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a disregard for and violation of the rights of others, which is not evident in this patient. Autism spectrum disorder is typically diagnosed in childhood and is characterized by deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. This patient's symptoms are more consistent with schizoid personality disorder.",
"Twelve hours after admission to the hospital because of a high-grade fever for 3 days, a 15-year-old boy has shortness of breath. During this period, he has had generalized malaise and a cough productive of moderate amounts of green sputum. For the past 10 days, he has had fever, a sore throat, and generalized aches; these symptoms initially improved, but worsened again over the past 5 days. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse is 109/min, respirations are 27/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 93%. There are decreased breath sounds and crackles heard over the upper right lung field. His hemoglobin concentration is 13.3 g/dL, leukocyte count is 15,000/mm3, and platelet count is 289,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest shows a right upper-lobe infiltrate. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Streptococcus pneumoniae
(B): Mycoplasma pneumoniae
(C): Staphylococcus aureus
(D): Chlamydophila pneumoniae
(E): Haemophilus influenzae
",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including high-grade fever, shortness of breath, cough productive of green sputum, and crackles heard over the upper right lung field, are consistent with pneumonia. The x-ray findings of a right upper-lobe infiltrate further support this diagnosis. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia, especially in adolescents and young adults. It is associated with a sudden onset of symptoms, high fever, productive cough with purulent sputum, and focal lung findings on examination. Other pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae, can also cause pneumonia, but they typically present with milder symptoms and are less likely to cause a lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray. Staphylococcus aureus is more commonly associated with necrotizing pneumonia and is less likely to cause a lobar infiltrate. Therefore, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms.",
"An elderly man presents to his physician with complaints of difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, and bilateral leg swelling which began 2 months ago. His breathlessness worsens while walking, climbing the stairs, and lying flat on his back. He also finds it difficult to sleep well at night, as he often wakes up to catch his breath. His pulse is 98/min and blood pressure is 114/90 mm Hg. On examination, he has mild respiratory distress, distended neck veins, and bilateral pitting edema is evident on the lower third of his legs. His respiratory rate is 33/min, SpO2 is 93% in room air, and coarse crepitations are heard over the lung bases. On auscultation, the P2 component of his second heart sound is heard loudest at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm is heard at the apex. Medication is prescribed for his symptoms which changes his cardiac physiology as depicted with the dashed line recorded post-medication. What is the mechanism of action of the prescribed medication?
Options:
(A): Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential
(B): Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient
(C): Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels
(D): Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption
(E): Reduction in myocardial contractility
",Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (C): Preferential dilatation of capacitance vessels.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, easy fatigability, bilateral leg swelling, and distended neck veins, are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF is characterized by impaired cardiac function leading to fluid retention and congestion in the systemic circulation. The patient's symptoms worsen with exertion and lying flat on his back, indicating increased preload on the heart.

The physical examination findings, including the presence of coarse crepitations over the lung bases, the loudest P2 component of the second heart sound at the second left intercostal space, and an S3 gallop rhythm at the apex, suggest left-sided heart failure. The presence of bilateral pitting edema on the lower third of the legs further supports the diagnosis of CHF.

The prescribed medication is likely a vasodilator that acts by preferentially dilating capacitance vessels. This leads to a reduction in preload, which is the volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole. By reducing preload, the medication decreases the amount of blood that the heart has to pump with each contraction, thereby reducing the workload on the heart and improving symptoms of CHF.

Options A, B, D, and E are not the correct mechanisms of action for the prescribed medication in this case. Decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential (Option A) would not directly address the underlying pathophysiology of CHF. Decrease in transmembrane sodium gradient (Option B) is not a typical mechanism of action for medications used in CHF. Inhibition of aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption (Option D) would primarily affect sodium and water retention, but would not directly address the underlying cardiac dysfunction. Reduction in myocardial contractility (Option E) would further impair cardiac function and worsen symptoms in a patient with CHF.",
"A 30-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of excessive fatigue and weakness for the last several weeks. He also complains of abdominal pain and constipation for the same duration. On further questioning, he reports that he has lost 8 pounds in the last 2 weeks. Past medical history and family history are insignificant. His temperature is 37.3° C (99.2° F), respirations are 21/min, pulse is 63/min, and blood pressure is 99/70 mm Hg. On physical examination, he is a tired-appearing, thin male. He has a bronze discoloration to his skin, but he denies being outside in the sun or any history of laying in tanning beds. What is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Administer intravenous hydrocortisone
(B): Administer intravenous fludrocortisone
(C): Start him on androgen replacement treatment
(D): Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy
(E): Order an ACTH stimulation test
",Start him on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy,Incorrect,"The correct answer is (E): Order an ACTH stimulation test.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease. The symptoms of fatigue, weakness, weight loss, abdominal pain, and constipation, along with the physical examination findings of bronze skin discoloration, are classic features of adrenal insufficiency. 

The next best step in the management of this patient is to order an ACTH stimulation test. This test is used to evaluate the function of the adrenal glands and can help confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. In this test, synthetic ACTH is administered, and the cortisol levels are measured before and after the administration. In patients with adrenal insufficiency, there will be a minimal or no increase in cortisol levels after ACTH administration.

Administering intravenous hydrocortisone (option A) or fludrocortisone (option B) without confirming the diagnosis with an ACTH stimulation test would be premature. Androgen replacement treatment (option C) is not indicated in the management of adrenal insufficiency. Starting the patient on both hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone therapy (option D) without confirming the diagnosis would also be inappropriate and potentially harmful if the patient does not have adrenal insufficiency.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to order an ACTH stimulation test to confirm the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency.",
"A 27-year-old HIV positive female gave birth to a 7lb 2oz (3.2 kg) baby girl. The obstetrician is worried that the child may have been infected due to the mother's haphazard use of her anti-retroviral medications. Which of the following assays would a hospital use detect the genetic material of HIV if the child had been infected?
Options:
(A): Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(B): Western blot
(C): Rapid HIV antibody test
(D): Polymerase chain reaction
(E): Southern blot
",Polymerase chain reaction,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Polymerase chain reaction.

Explanation:
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a molecular diagnostic test that can detect the genetic material (DNA or RNA) of HIV. In the case of an infant born to an HIV-positive mother, PCR is the preferred assay for detecting HIV infection because infants may still have maternal antibodies that can cause false-positive results on antibody tests like ELISA or rapid HIV antibody tests.

PCR can detect HIV proviral DNA within peripheral blood mononuclear cells, even in infants who are being treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). It has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting HIV infection in infants, with a sensitivity of over 90% by two to four weeks of age and 100% at three and six months.

In contrast, ELISA, Western blot, and rapid HIV antibody tests are antibody-based tests that detect the presence of HIV antibodies in the blood. These tests are not reliable for diagnosing HIV infection in infants because they can detect maternal antibodies passed from the mother to the child during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Southern blot is a laboratory technique used to detect specific DNA sequences, but it is not commonly used for diagnosing HIV infection in infants. PCR is the preferred method for detecting HIV genetic material in this context.",
"A 53-year-old man presents to his physician’s office with a persistent cough which he has had over the last few months. He was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the previous year and since then has been on a short-acting β-agonist to help alleviate his symptoms. Since his diagnosis, he has quit smoking, a habit which he had developed about 30 years ago. He used to smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes daily. Today, he has come in with an increase in his symptoms. He tells his physician that he has been having a fever for the past 3 days, ranging between 37.8°–39°C (100°F–102.2°F). Along with this, he has a persistent cough with copious amounts of greenish-yellow sputum. He has also been having difficulty breathing. On examination, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), the respirations are 22/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 115/min. Slight crackles and respiratory wheezes are prominent in the lower lung fields. His FEV1 is 57% of his normal predicted value. He is started on oxygen and a dose of oral prednisone. At this time, which of the following should also be considered as a treatment option?
Options:
(A): Doxycycline
(B): Ciprofloxacin
(C): Erythromycin
(D): Piperacillin
(E): Antibiotics would not be appropriate at this time
",Doxycycline,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Doxycycline.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is characterized by increased cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing. The presence of greenish-yellow sputum suggests a bacterial infection. Antibiotics are indicated in patients with COPD exacerbations who have increased sputum purulence, increased sputum volume, or both. Doxycycline is a commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including those associated with COPD exacerbations. It covers a broad spectrum of bacteria, including common pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is also effective against atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae. Therefore, doxycycline would be an appropriate treatment option in this patient.",
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of headaches for the past 2 weeks. His headaches tend to occur in the morning and are associated with nausea and vomiting. One month ago, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of fever, irritability, and neck rigidity, and he was successfully treated with antibiotics. His temperature today is 37.5°C (98.5°F). An MRI of the brain shows bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space. Which of the following is the most likely explanation of the patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus
(B): Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations
(C): Impaired CSF drainage into the subarachnoid space
(D): Impaired CSF drainage into the fourth ventricle
(E): Compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces
",Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including morning headaches, nausea, and vomiting, along with the findings on MRI of bilateral ventricular enlargement and enlargement of the subarachnoid space, are consistent with hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure.

Impaired CSF flow through the arachnoid granulations is the most likely explanation for the patient's condition. Arachnoid granulations are small protrusions of the arachnoid mater into the dural venous sinuses, where CSF is reabsorbed into the bloodstream. If there is a blockage or impairment in the flow of CSF through the arachnoid granulations, it can lead to the accumulation of CSF within the ventricles and subarachnoid space, resulting in hydrocephalus.

Increased CSF production by the choroid plexus (choice A) is not the most likely explanation in this case, as there is no mention of increased CSF production or overactivity of the choroid plexus.

Impaired CSF drainage into the subarachnoid space (choice C) is less likely, as the MRI findings show enlargement of the subarachnoid space, suggesting that CSF is accumulating in this area.

Impaired CSF drainage into the fourth ventricle (choice D) is also less likely, as the MRI findings show bilateral ventricular enlargement, suggesting that CSF is accumulating within the ventricles.

Compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces (choice E) is not the most likely explanation, as the symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with hydrocephalus, which is characterized by abnormal accumulation of CSF, rather than compensatory enlargement of CSF spaces.",
"A previously healthy 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 10-day history of unsteady gait, frequent falls, and twitching of the extremities. Physical examination shows bilateral saccadic eye movement in all directions and brief, involuntary muscle contractions of the trunk and limbs. There is an ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen. He undergoes surgical resection of the tumor. Histopathologic examination of this mass is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Blastic skeletal muscle cells arranged in nests and sheets
(B): Numerous immature lymphocytes in a starry sky pattern
(C): Abortive glomeruli and tubules in a spindle cell stroma
(D): Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil
(E): Hepatocytes in fetal and embryonic stages of differentiation
",Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this 2-year-old boy, including unsteady gait, frequent falls, twitching of the extremities, and saccadic eye movements, is suggestive of a neurologic disorder. The presence of an ill-defined, nontender mass in the upper right abdomen further supports the suspicion of a neurologic tumor. 

The histopathologic examination of this mass is most likely to show small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil. This description is characteristic of a neuroblastoma, which is a malignant tumor derived from neural crest cells. Neuroblastomas commonly occur in young children and can present with a variety of symptoms, including neurologic manifestations such as unsteady gait and muscle twitching. The presence of rosettes around a central neuropil is a classic histologic finding in neuroblastomas.",
"In a study, 2 groups are placed on different statin medications, statin A and statin B. Baseline LDL levels are drawn for each group and are subsequently measured every 3 months for 1 year. Average baseline LDL levels for each group were identical. The group receiving statin A exhibited an 11 mg/dL greater reduction in LDL in comparison to the statin B group. Statistical analysis reports a p-value of 0.052. Which of the following best describes the meaning of this p-value?
Options:
(A): If 100 similar experiments were conducted, 5.2 of them would show similar results
(B): There is a 5.2% chance that A is more effective than B is due to chance
(C): There is a 94.8% chance that the difference observed reflects a real difference
(D): This is a statistically significant result
(E): Though A is more effective than B, there is a 5.2% chance the difference is due to a true effect
",There is a 5.2% chance that A is more effective than B is due to chance,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (E): Though A is more effective than B, there is a 5.2% chance the difference is due to a true effect.

Explanation: 
A p-value of 0.052 indicates that there is a 5.2% chance that the observed difference in LDL reduction between statin A and statin B is due to chance. In other words, there is a 5.2% chance that the difference is not a true effect and could have occurred by random variation alone. Therefore, while statin A appears to be more effective in reducing LDL levels compared to statin B, there is still a small possibility that the observed difference is not actually a real difference and could be attributed to chance.",
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because she has a cord-like rash on her left calf that is red and painful to touch. She says that she has had multiple such lesions previously. Other medical history reveals that she has had 3 past spontaneous abortions at < 10 weeks of gestational age but has never been diagnosed with any diseases. She drinks socially but has never smoked or used drugs. She has never taken any medications except for over the counter analgesics and antipyretics. Physical exam shows that the cord-like lesion is tender, thick, and hardened on palpation. In addition, she has a lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities. Which of the following antibodies would most likely be found in this patient's blood?
Options:
(A): Anti-cardiolipin
(B): Anti-centromere
(C): Anti-helicase
(D): Anti-histone
(E): Anti-ribonucleoprotein
",Anti-cardiolipin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Anti-cardiolipin.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, including anti-cardiolipin antibodies. These antibodies can cause hypercoagulability, leading to the formation of blood clots in both arteries and veins. The cord-like rash on the patient's calf is likely a thrombosed superficial vein, known as superficial thrombophlebitis, which can occur in APS. The history of multiple spontaneous abortions is also suggestive of APS, as antiphospholipid antibodies can cause placental insufficiency and fetal loss. The lacy mottled violaceous rash on multiple extremities is consistent with livedo reticularis, another cutaneous manifestation of APS. Anti-cardiolipin antibodies are the most commonly detected antibodies in APS and are associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. Therefore, the most likely antibody to be found in this patient's blood is anti-cardiolipin.",
"A 28-year-old female visits her physician for workup of a new onset diastolic murmur found on physical examination. Past medical history is insignificant. Her temperature is 37.0 degrees C, blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg, pulse is 76/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. The patient denies dyspnea, fatigue, and syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography reveals a large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium. This patient is most at risk for:
Options:
(A): Abrupt hypotension
(B): Sudden cardiac death
(C): Deep venous thrombosis
(D): Acute arterial occlusion
(E): Septic embolism
",Acute arterial occlusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Acute arterial occlusion.

Explanation:
A large, pedunculated tumor in the left atrium, as seen on transthoracic echocardiography, is most likely a cardiac myxoma. Cardiac myxomas are the most common primary cardiac tumors and are typically located in the left atrium. They can cause a variety of symptoms depending on their size and location, including dyspnea, fatigue, syncope, and diastolic murmurs. 

One of the most serious complications of cardiac myxomas is embolization. The tumor can break off and travel through the bloodstream, leading to the formation of emboli in various organs. In this case, the patient is most at risk for acute arterial occlusion due to embolization of the tumor. This can result in sudden blockage of blood flow to a specific organ or limb, leading to ischemia and potentially tissue damage.

The other options are less likely in this scenario. Abrupt hypotension is not a common complication of cardiac myxomas unless there is significant obstruction of blood flow. Sudden cardiac death is also less likely in a patient with a new onset diastolic murmur and no other symptoms of cardiac dysfunction. Deep venous thrombosis and septic embolism are possible complications of cardiac myxomas, but acute arterial occlusion is the most immediate and serious concern.",
"An 8-year-old girl presents to the emergency department with respiratory distress, facial edema, and a skin rash after eating a buffet dinner with her family. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery, has met all developmental milestones and is fully vaccinated. Past medical history is significant for mild allergies to pet dander and ragweed, as well as a severe peanut allergy. She also has asthma. She normally carries both an emergency inhaler and EpiPen but forgot them today. Family history is noncontributory. The vital signs include: blood pressure 112/87 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, the patient has severe edema over her face and an audible stridor in both lungs. Of the following options, which is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): IM epinephrine
(B): oral diphenhydramine
(C): IV epinephrine
(D): extra-strength topical diphenhydramine
(E): inhaled sodium cromolyn - mast cell stabilizer
",IM epinephrine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) IM epinephrine.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with anaphylaxis, a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is characterized by respiratory distress, facial edema, and skin rash, which are all present in this patient. The patient also has a history of allergies and asthma, which puts her at a higher risk for anaphylaxis.

The most appropriate next step in the management of anaphylaxis is the administration of epinephrine. Epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and should be given as soon as possible. It acts by reversing the systemic effects of anaphylaxis, including bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, and increased vascular permeability.

In this case, IM epinephrine is the most appropriate route of administration because the patient is experiencing respiratory distress and audible stridor. IM epinephrine has a rapid onset of action and can quickly relieve bronchoconstriction and improve respiratory symptoms. It also has systemic effects that can help stabilize blood pressure and reduce edema.

Oral diphenhydramine (choice B) and extra-strength topical diphenhydramine (choice D) are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of anaphylaxis. While diphenhydramine is an antihistamine that can help relieve itching and hives associated with an allergic reaction, it does not have the same rapid onset of action as epinephrine and is not effective in treating the respiratory distress and cardiovascular symptoms of anaphylaxis.

IV epinephrine (choice C) is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient because the patient is currently stable and does not have hypotension. IV epinephrine is typically reserved for patients with severe anaphylaxis who are unresponsive to IM epinephrine or have persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation.

Inhaled sodium cromolyn (choice E) is not the most appropriate next step in the management of anaphylaxis. While sodium cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer that can help prevent the release of inflammatory mediators, it is not effective in treating the acute symptoms of anaphylaxis and should not be used as a first-line treatment.",
"An investigator is studying the cell morphologies of the respiratory tract. He obtains a biopsy from the mainstem bronchus of a patient. On microscopic examination, the biopsy sample shows uniform squamous cells in layers. Which of the following best describes the histologic finding seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Metaplasia
(B): Normal epithelium
(C): Dysplasia
(D): Hyperplasia
(E): Anaplasia
""
",Metaplasia,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Metaplasia.

Explanation:
Metaplasia refers to the reversible change in which one mature cell type is replaced by another mature cell type. In this case, the biopsy sample shows uniform squamous cells in layers, which is a change from the normal columnar epithelium of the respiratory tract. This change is commonly seen in response to chronic irritation, such as in habitual cigarette smokers. The normal ciliated columnar epithelial cells of the trachea and bronchi are often replaced by stratified squamous epithelial cells. Therefore, the histologic finding seen in this patient is consistent with metaplasia.",
"A 32-year-old female complains to her gynecologist that she has had irregular periods for several years. She has severe facial acne and dense black hairs on her upper lip, beneath her hairline anterior to her ears, and the back of her neck. Ultrasound reveals bilateral enlarged ovaries with multiple cysts. Which of the following is the patient most likely increased risk of developing?
Options:
(A): Hypothyroidism
(B): Endometrial carcinoma
(C): Addison disease
(D): Wegener granulomatosus
(E): Eclampsia
",Endometrial carcinoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Endometrial carcinoma.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings are consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder characterized by the presence of multiple cysts in the ovaries, irregular menstrual periods, and symptoms such as acne and hirsutism (excessive hair growth). 

Women with PCOS have an increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma, which is cancer of the lining of the uterus (endometrium). This increased risk is due to the hormonal imbalances seen in PCOS, specifically the elevated levels of estrogen and decreased levels of progesterone. 

In a normal menstrual cycle, the ovaries produce estrogen, which stimulates the growth of the endometrium. Progesterone, produced by the ovaries after ovulation, helps to regulate the growth of the endometrium and prepares it for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. In PCOS, there is a lack of ovulation and therefore a lack of progesterone production. This leads to unopposed estrogen stimulation of the endometrium, which can result in abnormal growth and an increased risk of endometrial carcinoma.

Therefore, the patient with PCOS is most likely at an increased risk of developing endometrial carcinoma. It is important for her to be monitored closely by her gynecologist and to discuss appropriate management options to reduce this risk.",
"A 52-year-old fisherman presents to the clinic for an evaluation of a pigmented lesion on his neck. He states that he first noticed the lesion last year, but he believes that it has been slowly growing in size. Dermatopathology determines that the lesion contains neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would likely be found on physical examination?
Options:
(A): Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area
(B): Macule that is 5mm in diameter
(C): Well-circumscribed papule with smooth borders
(D): Itching and pain to palpation
(E): Symmetrical ovoid macule
",Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area,Correct,"The correct choice is (A): Brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area.

Explanation:
According to the context information provided, the patient's pigmented lesion is determined to contain neoplastic cells of melanocytic origin. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, is characterized by certain clinical features. These features include asymmetry, irregular borders, variegated color, diameter ≥6 mm, and a recent change in or development of a new lesion. In the case of melanoma, the lesion may have a brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area. This variation in color is due to different histologic characteristics of the lesion, such as vessel ectasia and inflammation (red zones) and amelanotic or regressed foci (white and gray regions). Therefore, the likely characteristic of the lesion on physical examination would be a brown-black color in one area of the lesion to red-white in a different area.",
"Two days after being admitted to the hospital following a fall, a 77-year-old woman complains of fatigue and headaches. During the fall she sustained a right-sided subdural hematoma. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Her medications prior to admission were hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 130 mEq/L
K+ 4.0 mEq/L
Cl- 103 mEq/L
HCO3- 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.1 mg/dL
Osmolality 270 mOsmol/kg H2O
Urine
Sodium 45 mEq/L
Osmolality 326 mOsmol/kg H2O
A CT scan of the head shows an unchanged right-sided subdural hematoma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Head elevation
(B): Tolvaptan
(C): Desmopressin
(D): Fluid restriction
(E): Mannitol
",Fluid restriction,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Fluid restriction.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings indicate hyponatremia (low serum sodium level) with a serum sodium level of 130 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is a common electrolyte abnormality in patients with subdural hematoma and can be caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). SIADH is characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland, leading to water retention and dilutional hyponatremia.

In this case, the patient's urine osmolality is higher than the serum osmolality, indicating concentrated urine and inappropriate water retention. The low serum sodium level and concentrated urine are consistent with SIADH.

The most appropriate next step in management is fluid restriction. Restricting fluid intake can help correct the hyponatremia by reducing water intake and allowing the body to excrete excess water. This can help restore the serum sodium level to normal and alleviate the symptoms of fatigue and headaches.

Head elevation (option A) is not the most appropriate next step in management for hyponatremia caused by SIADH. While head elevation can help reduce intracranial pressure in patients with subdural hematoma, it does not address the underlying cause of the hyponatremia.

Tolvaptan (option B) and desmopressin (option C) are medications that can be used to treat hyponatremia, but they are not the most appropriate initial management options. Tolvaptan is a selective vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist that can increase free water excretion and raise serum sodium levels. Desmopressin is a synthetic analog of ADH that can be used to treat central diabetes insipidus, but it would not be appropriate in this case of SIADH.

Mannitol (option E) and hypertonic saline (option G) are osmotic diuretics that can be used to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with subdural hematoma. However, they are not the most appropriate next step in management for the hyponatremia caused by SIADH.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is fluid restriction (option D) to correct the hyponatremia caused by SIADH.",
"An 18-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her mother for vaginal bleeding. The mother states that she noticed the bleeding today, which appeared as brown discharge with clots in the patient’s diaper. The mother denies frequent nosebleeds or easy bruising. She also denies any known trauma. She does mention that the patient has been limping and complaining of left leg pain since a fall 2 months ago. On physical exam, there are multiple 2-3 cm hyperpigmented patches on the patient’s trunk. There is bilateral enlargement of the breasts but no pubic hair. The vaginal orifice is normal and clear with an intact hymen. A plain radiograph of the left lower leg shows patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis. Which of the following is associated with the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Bitemporal hemianopsia
(B): Hearing loss
(C): Hypertension
(D): Pheochromocytoma
(E): Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia
",Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.

Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the abnormal development of fibrous tissue in the bones. It can affect multiple bones in the body, leading to bone deformities and fractures. In this case, the patient's complaint of left leg pain and the findings on the radiograph of patchy areas of lytic bone and sclerosis within the femoral metaphysis are consistent with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.

The presence of hyperpigmented patches on the trunk, bilateral breast enlargement, and vaginal bleeding are also characteristic features of McCune-Albright syndrome, which is often associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by a somatic mutation in the GNAS gene, leading to the activation of the G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway. This results in the development of fibrous dysplasia, as well as other endocrine abnormalities such as precocious puberty, which can manifest as breast enlargement and vaginal bleeding in young girls.

The other options (A, B, C, and D) are not associated with the patient's most likely diagnosis. Bitemporal hemianopsia is typically seen in pituitary adenomas, not polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Hearing loss is not a characteristic feature of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Hypertension is not commonly associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, although it can occur in some cases of McCune-Albright syndrome. Pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal glands that can cause hypertension, but it is not associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia.",
"A 72-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital for treatment of unstable angina. Cardiac catheterization shows occlusion that has caused a 50% reduction in the diameter of the left circumflex artery. Resistance to blood flow in this vessel has increased by what factor relative to a vessel with no occlusion?
Options:
(A): 64
(B): 16
(C): 8
(D): 4
(E): 32
",16,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) 16.

Explanation:
The resistance to blood flow in a vessel is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the vessel's radius. This relationship is described by Poiseuille's law. 

When the diameter of a vessel is reduced by 50%, the radius is reduced by half. 

The resistance to blood flow in the vessel with the occlusion can be calculated by comparing it to a vessel with no occlusion. 

Let's assume the resistance in the vessel with no occlusion is R. 

Since the radius is reduced by half, the resistance in the vessel with the occlusion can be calculated using the formula:

Resistance with occlusion = R * (1/2)^4

Resistance with occlusion = R * (1/16)

Therefore, the resistance to blood flow in the vessel with the occlusion has increased by a factor of 16 relative to a vessel with no occlusion.",
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an irregular gait 3 days after receiving age-appropriate vaccinations. Examination of the lower extremities shows no redness or swelling. When the child stands on his right leg, his left leg drops and his pelvis tilts towards the left. Sensation to light touch is normal in both legs. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to the injection of the vaccine into which of the following locations?
Options:
(A): Inferolateral quadrant of the right buttock
(B): Inferomedial quadrant of the right buttock
(C): Inferomedial quadrant of the left buttock
(D): Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock
(E): Inferolateral quadrant of the left buttock
",Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Superomedial quadrant of the right buttock.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of an irregular gait, dropping of the left leg, and pelvic tilt towards the left suggest a condition known as Trendelenburg gait. This gait abnormality is caused by weakness or paralysis of the gluteus medius muscle, which is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve (L4-S1). 

The superior gluteal nerve is at risk of injury during injections into the superomedial quadrant of the buttock. This is because the superior gluteal nerve runs in close proximity to the upper outer quadrant of the gluteal region, which includes the superomedial quadrant of the buttock. 

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is injection of the vaccine into the superomedial quadrant of the right buttock, leading to injury or irritation of the superior gluteal nerve and subsequent weakness or paralysis of the gluteus medius muscle.",
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of decreased appetite and abdominal pain for the last several weeks. Physical examination shows a well-appearing toddler with a palpable left-sided abdominal mass that does not cross the midline. A CT of the abdomen shows a large, necrotic tumor on the left kidney. Histological examination of the kidney mass shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This tissue is most likely derived from the same embryological structure as which of the following?
Options:
(A): Carotid body
(B): Adrenal medulla
(C): Thyroid gland
(D): Papillary muscles
(E): Anterior pituitary
""
",Papillary muscles,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Papillary muscles.

Explanation:
The histological examination of the kidney mass in this case shows primitive blastemal cells and immature tubules and glomeruli. This is consistent with the diagnosis of Wilms tumor, which is the most common renal tumor in children. Wilms tumor is an embryonal renal neoplasm that arises from the metanephric blastema, which is the embryological structure that gives rise to the kidney. 

The other options listed are not derived from the same embryological structure as the kidney. The carotid body is a small cluster of cells located near the carotid artery and is derived from neural crest cells. The adrenal medulla is part of the adrenal gland and is derived from neural crest cells. The thyroid gland is derived from the endoderm. The anterior pituitary is derived from the oral ectoderm. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Papillary muscles, as they are derived from the same embryological structure as the kidney.",
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of an increasing difficulty in hearing over the past several months. His mother says they have to speak at a higher volume for him to understand them. He also complains of having difficulty reading his favorite books because he is not able to see the words clearly. His father received a renal transplant in his 20s. The vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Urea nitrogen 15 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL
Urine
Blood 1+
Protein 1+
RBC 15–17/hpf
WBC 1–2/hpf
The audiometry shows bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The ophthalmologic examination shows anterior lenticonus. Which of the following best explains these findings?
Options:
(A): Alport syndrome
(B): Fabry’s disease
(C): Fanconi syndrome
(D): Von Hippel-Lindau disease
(E): Tuberous sclerosis
",Alport syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Alport syndrome.

Explanation:
Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, eyes, and ears. It is characterized by progressive kidney disease, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities. In this case, the patient presents with bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is a common finding in Alport syndrome. The difficulty in hearing and the need for higher volume to understand speech are consistent with this diagnosis.

The ophthalmologic examination showing anterior lenticonus, which is a conical protrusion on the anterior aspect of the lens, is also characteristic of Alport syndrome. This finding occurs in 20 to 30 percent of males with X-linked Alport syndrome and is pathognomonic of the disease.

The family history of renal transplant in the father is also suggestive of Alport syndrome, as it can have variable inheritance patterns. Alport syndrome can be inherited in an X-linked recessive, autosomal recessive, or autosomal dominant manner.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation, family history, and examination findings, Alport syndrome is the most likely explanation for these findings. Further genetic testing may be warranted to confirm the diagnosis.",
"A 16-year-old female presents to her primary care physician due to lack of menstruation. She has never had a period and is anxious that she is not “keeping up” with her friends. She states that her breasts began developing when she was 13, and she had a growth spurt around the same time. Review of systems reveals that she has also been getting headaches every few months over the last year with some photosensitivity and nausea each time. Ibuprofen relieves her symptoms. The patient is a competitive ice skater and has never been sexually active. Her mother has a history of migraine headaches, and her older sister has a history of bipolar disorder. Both underwent menarche at age 15. At this visit, the patient’s temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 70/min, blood pressure is 118/65 mmHg, and respirations are 13/min. Her body mass index is 23.8 kg/m^2. Cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. Both breasts are Tanner IV with no expressable discharge. Pelvic and axillary hair growth is also Tanner IV. The patient is unable to tolerate a full pelvic exam, but the part of the vaginal canal that is examined is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are ordered and are below:

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
K+: 4.1 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 12 mg/dL
Glucose: 73 mg/dL
Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL
Ca2+: 9.7 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.7 mEq/L
AST: 11 U/L
ALT: 11 U/L
Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH): 16.2 mIU/mL (4.7-21.5 mIU/ml)
Estrogen: 240 pg/mL (64-357 pg/mL)

Abdominal ultrasound is performed and shows a normal uterus and ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Hypothalamic amenorrhea
(B): Hyperprolactinemia
(C): Imperforate hymen
(D): Vaginal septum
(E): Normal development
",Vaginal septum,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Vaginal septum.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of primary amenorrhea (lack of menstruation) with breast development (Tanner stage IV) and normal levels of estrogen and FSH suggests that she has normal ovarian function. The absence of a uterus or ovaries on abdominal ultrasound would suggest a müllerian anomaly, such as a vaginal septum. A vaginal septum is a congenital anomaly in which the vaginal canal is divided by a septum, resulting in obstruction of menstrual flow. This can lead to primary amenorrhea. The patient's inability to tolerate a full pelvic exam further supports this diagnosis. The other options are less likely based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Hypothalamic amenorrhea (option A) typically presents with low levels of estrogen and FSH. Hyperprolactinemia (option B) would be associated with high levels of prolactin, which were not provided in the laboratory results. Imperforate hymen (option C) would present with cyclic abdominal pain and a bulging hymen on physical examination. Normal development (option E) would not explain the absence of menstruation.",
"A 35-year-old man presents to the emergency room due to shortness of breath that started an hour ago while playing football with some friends. He has had similar episodes in the past when he also had to be rushed to the hospital. Physical examination shows body temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse rate is 100/min, respiratory rate is 28/min and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Also, it shows decreased breath sounds on both sides, the peak expiratory flow rate is 200 L/min and SpO2 is 89% on room air. The man is given an initial treatment with nebulization using an inhaled short-acting β-agonist. An arterial blood gas analysis shows the following:
pH 7.48
PaO2 59 mm Hg
PaCO2 26 mm Hg
HCO3- 26 mEq/L
After administering oxygen by mask, the man’s PaO2 increases to 75 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Asthma attack
(B): Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning
(C): Atelectasis
(D): Neuromuscular disease
(E): Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
",Asthma attack,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Asthma attack.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds on both sides, and a history of similar episodes in the past is highly suggestive of an asthma attack. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. The decreased breath sounds on both sides indicate a diffuse airway obstruction, which is consistent with asthma.

The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low PaO2 of 59 mm Hg, indicating hypoxemia. This is expected in asthma due to ventilation-perfusion mismatch and impaired gas exchange. The PaCO2 of 26 mm Hg is within the normal range, suggesting that the patient is not retaining carbon dioxide and is able to adequately ventilate.

After administering oxygen by mask, the patient's PaO2 increases to 75 mm Hg. This improvement in oxygenation with supplemental oxygen supports the diagnosis of asthma. In asthma, administration of supplemental oxygen can help improve oxygenation by increasing the oxygen content in the blood.

Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning (option B) would typically present with a cherry-red appearance of the skin and mucous membranes, headache, confusion, and a history of exposure to a closed space with a potential source of CO. The arterial blood gas analysis would show an elevated carboxyhemoglobin level and a left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve.

Atelectasis (option C) refers to the collapse or closure of a lung or a part of a lung. It can be caused by various factors, such as airway obstruction, compression, or hypoventilation. Atelectasis would typically present with decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion over the affected area. The arterial blood gas analysis would show a decrease in PaO2 and possibly an increase in PaCO2.

Neuromuscular disease (option D) can cause respiratory muscle weakness and lead to respiratory failure. However, the patient's presentation with decreased breath sounds on both sides and the improvement in oxygenation with supplemental oxygen are not consistent with neuromuscular disease.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (option E) is a severe form of respiratory failure characterized by acute onset of hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on imaging, and absence of left atrial hypertension. While ARDS can cause severe hypoxemia, the patient's history, physical examination findings, and response to supplemental oxygen are more consistent with asthma.",
"A 48-year-old homeless male is brought to the emergency department, by the police, for altered mental status. Past medical records are unavailable. A physical exam on admission reveals scleral icterus and a flapping tremor of the wrists during extension. The patient is admitted to the hospital and his treatment is started after appropriate investigation. The next morning on rounds, he complains of eleven episodes of diarrhea and near-constant flatulence overnight. His mental status has improved and his hand tremor has resolved. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely receive after admission?
Options:
(A): Thiamine
(B): Lactulose
(C): Naloxone
(D): Loperamide
(E): Rifaximin
",Lactulose,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Lactulose.

Explanation:
This patient most likely received lactulose after admission. The patient's presentation with altered mental status, scleral icterus, and flapping tremor of the wrists during extension is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease. Lactulose is the treatment of choice for hepatic encephalopathy.

Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide that is not absorbed in the small intestine. It is metabolized by colonic bacteria into short-chain fatty acids, which acidify the colonic contents. This acidification promotes the conversion of ammonia (a neurotoxin) to ammonium (a non-absorbable form), reducing the amount of ammonia that is absorbed into the bloodstream. By reducing ammonia levels, lactulose helps improve mental status and resolve symptoms such as hand tremor.

Thiamine (choice A) is used in the treatment of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by thiamine deficiency and presents with neurological symptoms such as confusion and ataxia. However, the patient's presentation is more consistent with hepatic encephalopathy rather than Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

Naloxone (choice C) is an opioid receptor antagonist used in the treatment of opioid overdose. It would not be the appropriate treatment for this patient's presentation.

Loperamide (choice D) is an anti-diarrheal medication that slows down intestinal motility. It would not be the appropriate treatment for this patient's presentation.

Rifaximin (choice E) is an antibiotic that is sometimes used in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. However, lactulose is the first-line treatment and is more effective in reducing ammonia levels. Therefore, lactulose would be the most likely medication given to this patient.",
"A 61-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of abdominal pain and constipation. He reports a 4-day history of steady right lower quadrant pain. He has had one small bowel movement in 4 days. Normally he has a bowel movement once a day. His medical history is notable for poorly controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, and atorvastatin. He has a 40 pack-year smoking history and drinks 3-4 beers per day. His diet consists primarily of fast food. His temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 160/95 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 16/min. A review of the patient’s medical record reveals colonoscopy results from 1 year ago. Relevant findings included multiple small, pedunculated polyps which were removed, multiple colonic mucosal outpouchings, and no other masses. This patient’s condition is most strongly associated with which of the following disorders?
Options:
(A): Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
(B): Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder
(C): Ehlers-Danlos syndrome
(D): Goodpasture syndrome
(E): Menetrier disease
",Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

Explanation:
Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of genetic disorders that affect the connective tissues in the body. Connective tissues provide support and structure to various organs and systems, including the gastrointestinal tract. EDS can lead to gastrointestinal manifestations, such as abdominal pain and constipation.

In this case, the patient presents with abdominal pain and constipation, which are common symptoms of EDS. Additionally, the patient's medical history is notable for multiple small, pedunculated polyps and colonic mucosal outpouchings, which are consistent with the gastrointestinal manifestations of EDS.

The other options listed are not associated with the patient's symptoms or medical history:
(A) Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and liver, not the gastrointestinal tract.
(B) Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disorder primarily affects the kidneys and does not typically present with gastrointestinal symptoms.
(D) Goodpasture syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the kidneys and lungs, not the gastrointestinal tract.
(E) Menetrier disease is a rare disorder characterized by enlarged gastric folds in the stomach, which would not explain the patient's symptoms or medical history.",
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with sudden onset of slurred speech. The patient’s eldest daughter says that he couldn’t move his arm during the episode. Past medical history is significant for hypertension and a hemorrhagic stroke 6 years ago, which was treated surgically. After admission, the patient gets increasingly worse and loses consciousness. A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?
Options:
(A): Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation
(B): Refer this case to the court
(C): Contact another family member for consent
(D): Perform the surgery without consent
(E): Report the daughter to the police
",Contact another family member for consent,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Contact another family member for consent.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is in a comatose state and unable to provide consent for the life-saving operation. The daughter, who is the closest family member available, does not consent to the operation due to personal reasons. However, it is important to explore other options before making a decision.

Contacting another family member for consent is the most appropriate course of action in this situation. The physician should try to identify and contact other family members who may have a legal authority to make decisions on behalf of the patient. This could include a spouse, another adult child, or a legal guardian if one has been appointed.

It is important to involve other family members in the decision-making process to ensure that the patient's best interests are considered. The physician should explain the urgency and potential life-saving nature of the operation to the other family member and seek their consent. If no other family member is available or willing to provide consent, then the case may need to be referred to the court for a decision.

Performing the surgery without consent (option D) is not ethically appropriate as it violates the patient's autonomy and legal rights. Reporting the daughter to the police (option E) is not relevant in this situation as it does not address the issue of obtaining consent for the surgery.",
"A 50-year-old man with congestive heart failure (CHF) was started on an experimental analog of atrial natriuretic peptide. Which of the following would he expect to experience?
Options:
(A): Increased water reabsorption by the renal collecting ducts
(B): Vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, aldosterone release
(C): Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation
(D): Increased renal absorption of sodium and water
(E): Increased plasma calcium and decreased renal reabsorption of phosphate
","Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation",Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Increased glomerular filtration rate, restricted aldosterone release, vascular smooth muscle dilation.

Explanation:
Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone released by the atria of the heart in response to increased atrial volume and pressure. ANP has several effects on the body, including increasing glomerular filtration rate (GFR), restricting aldosterone release, and causing vascular smooth muscle dilation.

Increased GFR: ANP dilates the afferent arteriole, which increases glomerular capillary pressure and enhances filtration in the glomerulus. This leads to increased urine flow and sodium excretion.

Restricted aldosterone release: ANP inhibits the release of aldosterone, a hormone that promotes sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. By restricting aldosterone release, ANP decreases sodium reabsorption and promotes sodium excretion.

Vascular smooth muscle dilation: ANP causes vasodilation, which leads to a decrease in arterial blood pressure. This helps to reduce the workload on the heart and improve cardiac function.

Therefore, a patient with congestive heart failure who is started on an analog of ANP would expect to experience increased GFR, restricted aldosterone release, and vascular smooth muscle dilation.",
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. The patient’s vitals are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min, respiratory rate 39/min, and temperature 37.1°C (98.8℉). On physical examination, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is cyanotic. There are open fractures of the left femur and left tibia, a likely shoulder dislocation, multiple contusions on the limbs and thorax, and a puncture wound on the left side of his chest. There are no breath sounds on the left side and there is hyperresonance to percussion on the left. Preparations are made for an emergency needle thoracostomy to be performed to treat this patient’s likely tension pneumothorax. Which one of the following is the best choice to provide informed consent for this procedure?
Options:
(A): The patient’s closest relatives (spouse, child or parent), who must be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
(B): One of the witnesses at the scene of the car accident, who should be brought to the hospital as fast as possible
(C): The hospital ethics committee
(D): Informed consent is not needed in this case
(E): The hospital lawyer should immediately give temporary medical power of attorney to a member of the hospital ethics committee who will make all the medical decisions for the patient only until the patient is conscious again.
",Informed consent is not needed in this case,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Informed consent is not needed in this case.

Explanation:
Informed consent is the process by which a patient or their legal representative gives permission for a medical procedure or treatment after being informed of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. However, in emergency situations where there is an immediate threat to the patient's life or health, obtaining informed consent may not be possible or practical.

In this case, the patient is unconscious with a GCS of 9/15 and is in critical condition with signs of tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition. Immediate intervention is required to relieve the tension pneumothorax and stabilize the patient's condition. Waiting for the patient's closest relatives or witnesses from the scene of the accident to arrive and provide informed consent would delay potentially life-saving treatment.

In emergency situations, healthcare providers are allowed to perform necessary procedures without obtaining informed consent in order to save the patient's life or prevent further harm. This is known as implied consent or emergency consent. The priority is to provide immediate medical intervention to stabilize the patient's condition.

Therefore, in this case, informed consent is not needed, and the healthcare team should proceed with the emergency needle thoracostomy to treat the tension pneumothorax.",
"A group of researchers wants to evaluate how often the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is related to high-risk behaviors in female sex workers from their country. An additional aim is to evaluate the association between HIV acquisition and certain sociodemographic factors. The researchers collect data through interviewer-administered questionnaires (for behavioral and sociodemographic data) as well as through clinical and serological evaluation/screening methods for HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Which of the following could be the main outcome measure of their study?
Options:
(A): Incidence
(B): Prevalence
(C): Hazard rate
(D): Relative risk
(E): Attributable risk
",Prevalence,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Prevalence.

Explanation:
In this study, the researchers are collecting data on the frequency of HIV in female sex workers and evaluating its association with high-risk behaviors and sociodemographic factors. Prevalence refers to the proportion of individuals in a population who have a specific condition or disease at a given point in time. In this case, the researchers are interested in determining the prevalence of HIV among female sex workers. They are not measuring the incidence (the number of new cases of HIV over a specific period of time), hazard rate (the rate at which individuals develop HIV), relative risk (the ratio of the probability of developing HIV in one group compared to another), or attributable risk (the proportion of disease cases that can be attributed to a specific risk factor).",
"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of multiple episodes of small amounts of blood in his stools. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. His hemoglobin concentration is 8.3 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 72μm3. Colonoscopy shows a 2.3-cm polypoid mass in the ascending colon. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen of the lesion is shown. Which of the following processes is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Underexpression of COX-2
(B): Increased activity of c-KIT
(C): Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine
(D): Impaired degradation of β-catenin
(E): Abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins
",Impaired degradation of β-catenin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Impaired degradation of β-catenin.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of blood in the stools, pale conjunctivae, low hemoglobin concentration, and mean corpuscular volume suggest that he is experiencing gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. The finding of a polypoid mass in the ascending colon on colonoscopy further supports the diagnosis of colorectal cancer.

Impaired degradation of β-catenin is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition. β-catenin is a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation. In normal cells, β-catenin is tightly regulated and undergoes degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, in colorectal cancer, there is often a mutation or dysregulation in the Wnt signaling pathway, leading to impaired degradation of β-catenin.

Accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm allows it to translocate to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcriptional co-activator and promotes the expression of target genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. This dysregulation of β-catenin signaling contributes to the development and progression of colorectal cancer.

The other options are not directly related to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer in this patient. Underexpression of COX-2 (option A) is not typically associated with colorectal cancer. Increased activity of c-KIT (option B) is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), not colorectal cancer. Increased phosphorylation of serine and threonine (option C) and abnormal transfer of phosphate to cellular proteins (option E) are not specific to colorectal cancer and do not play a significant role in its pathogenesis.",
"A 68-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a 7-month history of fatigue and low back pain. Her pain is not improved by over the counter analgesics. Laboratory analysis is notable for a calcium level of 11.5 mg/dL, creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dL, and blood urea nitrogen level of 30 mg/dL. Large eosinophilic casts are seen on renal biopsy. Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen on peripheral blood smear?
Options:
(A): Abundant reticulocytes
(B): Linear aggregations of red blood cells
(C): Schistocytes
(D): Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells
(E): Smudge cells
",Linear aggregations of red blood cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Linear aggregations of red blood cells.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of fatigue, low back pain, and laboratory findings of elevated calcium, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels suggest a possible diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Large eosinophilic casts seen on renal biopsy further support this diagnosis. In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells produce monoclonal immunoglobulins, which can lead to the formation of linear aggregations of red blood cells, known as rouleaux formation. This is the most likely finding to be seen on peripheral blood smear in this patient. 

Option (A) Abundant reticulocytes is not the correct answer because reticulocytes are immature red blood cells and are not typically increased in multiple myeloma.

Option (C) Schistocytes is not the correct answer because schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells and are typically seen in conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or thrombotic microangiopathies, not multiple myeloma.

Option (D) Leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells is not the correct answer because multiple myeloma is a plasma cell disorder and does not typically cause leukocytosis with abundant mature myeloid cells.

Option (E) Smudge cells is not the correct answer because smudge cells are seen in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), not multiple myeloma.",
"A 95-year-old woman who is a resident at a long term care facility, got up from her chair, tripped on a rug, and fell on her right knee. She could not get up without assistance and complained of severe pain in her right hip and buttock. The nurse who evaluated her tried to stand her up, but when the patient tried to stand on her right leg, she dropped her left hip and lost her balance. The nurse then recognized that her patient had a foreshortened right leg fixed in the adducted position and a large swelling in her right buttock. At the receiving hospital, the patient was confused and, though she knew her name, she couldn’t remember the date and insists to leave the hospital immediately to see her family. Past medical history includes diabetes, congestive heart failure, and incontinence. She is currently taking metformin, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and oxybutynin. Physical exam confirmed the nurse’s findings. Radiographs proved the presence of a right posterior hip dislocation without fractures. What medication is most likely associated with this patient’s confusion?
Options:
(A): Metformin
(B): Oxybutynin
(C): Metoprolol
(D): Lisinopril
(E): Hydrochlorothiazide
",Oxybutynin,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Oxybutynin.

Explanation:
Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication commonly used to treat urinary incontinence. Anticholinergic medications work by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous system. While they can be effective in treating certain conditions, they can also have side effects, particularly in older adults.

Confusion is a known side effect of anticholinergic medications, including oxybutynin. This is because acetylcholine plays a role in cognitive function and memory. Blocking its action can lead to cognitive impairment and confusion, especially in older adults who may already be at risk for cognitive decline.

In this case, the 95-year-old woman is taking oxybutynin for her incontinence. Her confusion and inability to remember the date could be attributed to the anticholinergic effects of the medication. It is important to consider medication side effects in older adults, especially when they present with new or worsening cognitive symptoms.",
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the clinic for an annual wellness examination. She is healthy with no prior history of significant illness. She exercises 3-4 times a week and eats a plant-based diet with no carbonated drinks. When asked if anything is bothering her, she reports that she has been having recurring episodes of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes for the past year. She denies any fever, sick contacts, cough, headaches, chest pain, urinary symptoms, or constipation/diarrhea during these episodes. She is told to take a medication to alleviate her symptoms as needed. What is the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question?
Options:
(A): Alpha-adrenergic agonist
(B): Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors
(C): Disruption of disulfide bonds
(D): Inhibition of phosphodiesterase-5
(E): Short acting beta-2 agonist
",Alpha-adrenergic agonist,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B) Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes, it is likely that she is experiencing allergic rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is an inflammatory condition of the nasal passages caused by an allergic reaction to certain substances, such as pollen, dust mites, or animal dander.

The most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis is the use of antihistamines, which work by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical released during an allergic reaction. Histamine binds to histamine receptors, including muscarinic receptors, leading to the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors is the mechanism of action of antihistamines. By blocking these receptors, antihistamines prevent the binding of histamine and reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis, such as sneezing, congestion, and itchy eyes.

Therefore, the likely mechanism of action of the medication in question is competitive blockage of muscarinic receptors.",
"A 27-year-old woman was referred to a dermatology clinic due to a changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue. Although she has not had any recent changes in her daily routines, she also complains of increasing fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss. She has a blood pressure of 126/77 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min, and heart rate of 88/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. Anti-U1 RNP antibodies and increased creatinine kinase were found in her serum. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
(B): Mixed connective tissue disease
(C): Polymyositis
(D): Systemic sclerosis
(E): Rheumatoid arthritis
",Mixed connective tissue disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Mixed connective tissue disease.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of changing discoloration of her fingers from white to red to blue, along with fatigue, muscle weakness, and weight loss, are suggestive of Raynaud's phenomenon. Raynaud's phenomenon is commonly seen in connective tissue diseases. The presence of anti-U1 RNP antibodies in the patient's serum is highly specific for mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). MCTD is a systemic autoimmune disease that shares features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polymyositis, and systemic sclerosis. The presence of increased creatinine kinase suggests muscle involvement, which is seen in MCTD. The patient's normal heart and lung sounds make systemic sclerosis less likely. Rheumatoid arthritis is not associated with Raynaud's phenomenon or anti-U1 RNP antibodies.",
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, has a poor appetite, and has had a problem concentrating for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also has had low energy and has lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. Her physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should be avoided in this patient?
Options:
(A): Bupropion
(B): Citalopram
(C): Fluoxetine
(D): Mirtazapine
(E): Trazodone
",Bupropion,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bupropion.

Explanation:
The patient's history of binge eating and purging behavior during high school suggests a possible diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of eating disorders, as it can lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures. Therefore, treatment with bupropion should be avoided in this patient. 

Citalopram, fluoxetine, mirtazapine, and trazodone are all commonly used antidepressant medications and do not have specific contraindications in patients with a history of eating disorders. These medications can be considered as treatment options for the patient's depressive symptoms. However, the choice of medication should be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms, medical history, and individual preferences. It is important to involve the patient in the decision-making process and consider their specific needs and concerns.",
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for an annual physical examination. He reports that his vision has progressively improved over the past 6 months and he no longer needs the glasses he used while driving. He has hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include glyburide, hydrochlorothiazide, and enalapril. Examination shows 20/20 vision bilaterally. Fundoscopy shows a few microaneurysms of retinal vessels. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision?
Options:
(A): Decreased susceptibility to glare
(B): Denaturation of lens protein
(C): Liquefication of the vitreous body
(D): Increased ciliary muscle tone
(E): Increased lens elasticity
",Denaturation of lens protein,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Denaturation of lens protein.

Explanation:
The patient's improved vision and no longer needing glasses while driving suggest a change in the refractive power of the lens. The most likely explanation for this change is denaturation of lens protein. In conditions such as diabetes, the lens can undergo glycation, which leads to the accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in the lens proteins. This can cause denaturation of the lens protein, leading to changes in the refractive power of the lens and improved vision.

Decreased susceptibility to glare (choice A) is not the most likely explanation for the patient's improved vision in this case. Glare is a subjective symptom and is not typically associated with changes in refractive power.

Liquefaction of the vitreous body (choice C) is not the most likely explanation for the patient's improved vision in this case. Liquefaction of the vitreous body is a normal age-related change and is not typically associated with changes in refractive power.

Increased ciliary muscle tone (choice D) is not the most likely explanation for the patient's improved vision in this case. Increased ciliary muscle tone would lead to accommodation, which would result in near vision improvement, not distance vision improvement.

Increased lens elasticity (choice E) is not the most likely explanation for the patient's improved vision in this case. Increased lens elasticity would result in accommodation, which would lead to near vision improvement, not distance vision improvement.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's improved vision is denaturation of lens protein.",
"A 21-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with right arm pain and limited range of motion. She does not recall trauma to the arm. She also complains of diarrhea and nausea. She is sexually active with one male partner and admits to having pain during intercourse. There is vague and diffuse tenderness to palpation in all four abdominal quadrants. No erythema or edema is noted on the right arm. The fecal occult test is negative. Past records show that this patient has been in the ER 7 times in the past year with similar symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Ulcerative colitis
(B): Illness anxiety disorder
(C): Somatization disorder
(D): Somatoform pain disorder
(E): Conversion disorder
",Somatization disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Somatization disorder.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is somatization disorder. Somatization disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by multiple physical symptoms that cannot be explained by a medical condition. Patients with somatization disorder often have a long history of seeking medical attention for various symptoms, without any clear medical cause.

In this case, the patient presents with right arm pain and limited range of motion, along with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea. She also reports pain during intercourse. These symptoms are vague and diffuse, and there is no evidence of trauma or physical findings on examination. Additionally, the negative fecal occult test suggests that there is no organic cause for the gastrointestinal symptoms.

The patient's history of multiple ER visits with similar symptoms further supports the diagnosis of somatization disorder. This pattern of seeking medical attention for various symptoms without a clear medical cause is characteristic of somatization disorder.

It is important to note that somatization disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other medical conditions should be ruled out before making this diagnosis. However, in this case, the lack of clear medical findings and the pattern of recurrent, unexplained symptoms make somatization disorder the most likely diagnosis.",
"A 22-year-old man presents to a psychiatrist complaining of mood fluctuations. He is accompanied by his mother who reports that the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy. The patient admits to spending $2,000 of his parent’s money, without asking, on a down payment for a motorcycle. The episode resolved after 5 days, at which point the patient felt guilty and upset. The patient’s medical history is notable for multiple month-long episodes in the past 2 years of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in his hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty. The patient has a history of severe meningoencephalitis at the age of 17 requiring four days in the intensive care unit. During that episode, he reported seeing monkeys in his hospital room. On exam, he is a well-appearing, cooperative male in no acute distress. He is alert and oriented with a normal affect. He states that he feels sad and guilty about what happens. He denies suicidal ideation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Bipolar I disorder
(B): Bipolar II disorder
(C): Cyclothymic disorder
(D): Persistent depressive disorder
(E): Schizoaffective disorder
",Bipolar II disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Bipolar II disorder.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is Bipolar II disorder. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of major depression and hypomania. 

In this case, the patient has a history of multiple month-long episodes of feeling sad, sleeping more than usual, being uninterested in hobbies, and feeling constantly tired and guilty, which are consistent with major depressive episodes. 

Additionally, the patient recently experienced a 5-day episode of minimal sleep and unusual levels of energy, during which he spent a large amount of money without asking, which is consistent with a hypomanic episode. 

The fact that the episode resolved after 5 days and the patient felt guilty and upset afterwards is also indicative of a hypomanic episode, as opposed to a full manic episode. 

The patient's history of severe meningoencephalitis and hallucinations during that episode may be relevant, but it is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. 

Cyclothymic disorder is characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. 

Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a chronic depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years. 

Therefore, based on the patient's history of both major depressive episodes and hypomanic episodes, the most likely diagnosis is Bipolar II disorder.",
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because a 5-week history of abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea that has worsened in the past 24 hours. She was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 1 year ago but has had difficulty complying with her drug regimen. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 120/min, and blood pressure is 92/56 mm Hg. Examination shows a distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds. Fluid resuscitation is initiated. In addition to complete bowel rest, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Double-contrast barium enema
(B): Abdominal CT scan with contrast
(C): CT angiography
(D): Abdominal x-ray
(E): Colonoscopy
",Abdominal x-ray,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Abdominal x-ray.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of ulcerative colitis and worsening abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and signs of peritonitis (distended, rigid abdomen and hypoactive bowel sounds), the most appropriate next step in management is an abdominal x-ray. This is because an abdominal x-ray can help evaluate for complications such as toxic megacolon, which is a potentially life-threatening complication of ulcerative colitis characterized by severe colonic distention. The x-ray may show signs of colonic dilation, air-fluid levels, and thumbprinting (indicative of mucosal edema). 

Double-contrast barium enema (option A) and colonoscopy (option E) are contraindicated in patients with suspected toxic megacolon due to the risk of perforation. 

Abdominal CT scan with contrast (option B) and CT angiography (option C) may be useful in certain situations, but an abdominal x-ray is the most appropriate initial step in this patient with signs of peritonitis and suspected toxic megacolon.",
"A 55-year-old man recovering from knee replacement surgery complains of breathlessness in the postoperative ward. He has been confined to bed for the past 5 days and is under observation. He felt a sudden difficulty in breathing and called for the ward nurse. He says that he is unable to take deep breaths and has a sharp pain on the right side of his chest with each inspiration. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.8°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 31/min, and the blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. He experiences pain in his right calf on dorsiflexion. There are no other prominent findings on physical examination. His chest X-ray does not show anything significant. The ECG reveals sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best course of management at this time?
Options:
(A): Subcutaneous fondaparinux
(B): CT scan
(C): Inferior vena cava filter
(D): Ventilation-perfusion scan
(E): Lower extremity doppler
",Subcutaneous fondaparinux,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Subcutaneous fondaparinux.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with a pulmonary embolism (PE). The sudden onset of breathlessness, sharp chest pain with inspiration, tachycardia, and calf pain on dorsiflexion are all suggestive of a PE. The patient's recent surgery and prolonged immobilization further increase the risk for developing a PE.

The initial management of a suspected PE involves anticoagulation therapy. Subcutaneous fondaparinux is a direct factor Xa inhibitor that is commonly used for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism, including PE. It has been shown to be effective and safe in the management of PE, and it does not require routine monitoring of coagulation parameters.

A CT scan is a useful diagnostic tool for confirming the diagnosis of PE, but it is not the initial management step. It may be performed after the patient has been stabilized with anticoagulation therapy.

An inferior vena cava filter is a device that can be placed to prevent further embolization in patients with recurrent PE despite anticoagulation therapy or in those who have contraindications to anticoagulation. It is not the initial management step in this patient.

A ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan is a diagnostic test that can be used to evaluate for PE, but it is not the initial management step. It may be performed after the patient has been stabilized with anticoagulation therapy.

A lower extremity doppler is a diagnostic test that can be used to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a risk factor for PE. However, in this patient, the presence of calf pain on dorsiflexion is highly suggestive of DVT, and the management for a confirmed or suspected DVT is anticoagulation therapy.

Therefore, the best course of management at this time is to initiate subcutaneous fondaparinux for the treatment of the suspected PE.",
"A 62-year-old man is brought to his primary care physician by his wife who is concerned about the patient's frequent falls. Approximately 6 months ago, she started noticing that he was walking more slowly than usual. He has fallen more than 6 times in the past month, and she is worried that he will sustain a serious injury if he does not stop falling. The patient is a retired banking executive and was active as a triathlete until the age of 60. He does not smoke and drinks 2-3 alcoholic beverages per day. His family history is notable for normal pressure hydrocephalus in his mother and Alzheimer dementia in his father. His temperature is 97.8°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 131/81 mmHg, pulse is 68/min, and respirations are 19/min. On exam, his movements appear slowed and forced. He shuffles his feet when he walks. Tone is increased in his upper and lower extremities bilaterally. This patient's condition is most strongly associated with which of the following histologic findings on brain autopsy?
Options:
(A): Accumulations of beta-pleated sheets
(B): Atrophy of the caudate nucleus
(C): Extracellular aggregates of amyloid beta
(D): Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein
(E): Intracellular inclusions of hyperphosphorylated tau
",Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Parkinson's disease, which is characterized by bradykinesia (slowness of movement), postural instability, and resting tremor. The histologic findings on brain autopsy that are most strongly associated with Parkinson's disease are intracellular inclusions of alpha-synuclein, known as Lewy bodies. Lewy bodies are eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions that are found in the substantia nigra and other areas of the brain in patients with Parkinson's disease. These inclusions are composed of aggregated alpha-synuclein protein. The accumulation of alpha-synuclein disrupts normal cellular function and leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, resulting in the characteristic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",
"A 16-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a regular check-up. His mother says that he has not yet begun to walk. He is exclusively breastfed. He is at the 20th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 50th percentile for head circumference. Physical examination shows erosion of the enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars. He has frontal bossing. His wrists are widened, his legs appear bowed, and there is beading of the ribs. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase
(B): Defect in type I collagen
(C): Impaired growth plate mineralization
(D): Impaired osteoclast-mediated bone resorption
(E): Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
",Impaired growth plate mineralization,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Impaired growth plate mineralization.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with rickets, which is a disorder characterized by impaired mineralization of the growth plate. The patient's exclusive breastfeeding may contribute to the deficiency of vitamin D, which is necessary for calcium and phosphate absorption and bone mineralization. The physical examination findings, such as frontal bossing, widened wrists, bowed legs, and beading of the ribs, are classic signs of rickets. The erosion of enamel on the lingual surface of the incisors and carious molars is also consistent with vitamin D deficiency. Deficiency of cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase (choice A) is seen in scurvy, which presents with bleeding gums, petechiae, and poor wound healing. Osteoid proliferation in the subperiosteal bone (choice B) is seen in osteomalacia, which presents with bone pain and muscle weakness. Defect in type I collagen (choice C) is seen in osteogenesis imperfecta, which presents with multiple fractures and blue sclerae. Impaired osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (choice D) is seen in osteopetrosis, which presents with fractures, anemia, and hepatosplenomegaly. Mutation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (choice E) is seen in achondroplasia, which presents with short stature and disproportionate limb length.",
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with altered mental status. The patient is in acute distress and cannot provide history due to disorientation.

The patient is treated urgently with intravenous fluid, dopamine, and broad spectrum antibiotics. The patient’s blood pressure improves to 101/70 mm Hg. On ultrasound of the abdomen, the common bile duct is dilated. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): ERCP
(B): Close monitoring
(C): MRCP
(D): Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram
(E): CT abdomen
",ERCP,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) ERCP.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with altered mental status, icteric sclera and skin, and a dilated common bile duct on ultrasound. These findings are consistent with obstructive jaundice, which can be caused by a common bile duct stone. The best next step in the management of this patient is an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). ERCP is a procedure that combines endoscopy and fluoroscopy to visualize the biliary tree and pancreatic duct. It allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, such as stone extraction or stent placement, to relieve the obstruction. Close monitoring (B) alone would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. MRCP (C) and CT abdomen (E) may provide additional information, but they do not offer the same therapeutic options as ERCP. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (D) is an alternative procedure that can be used to visualize the biliary tree, but it is typically reserved for cases where ERCP is not feasible or unsuccessful.",
"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 5-month history of intermittent flank pain. Over the past 2 years, she has had five urinary tract infections. Her blood pressure is 150/88 mm Hg. Physical examination shows bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses. Serum studies show a urea nitrogen concentration of 29 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.4 mg/dL. Renal ultrasonography shows bilaterally enlarged kidneys with multiple parenchymal anechoic masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Medullary sponge kidney
(B): Simple renal cysts
(C): Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(D): Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease
(E): Obstructive cystic dysplasia
",Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). ADPKD is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that an affected individual has a 50% chance of passing the condition on to each of their children.

The patient's history of intermittent flank pain and urinary tract infections is common in ADPKD. The presence of bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses on physical examination is also consistent with enlarged kidneys due to the cysts. The laboratory findings of elevated urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations suggest impaired kidney function, which can occur as the cysts progressively replace normal kidney tissue.

Renal ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing ADPKD. The presence of multiple parenchymal anechoic masses (cysts) in the enlarged kidneys seen on the ultrasound is characteristic of ADPKD.

The other options listed are not consistent with the patient's presentation:
- Medullary sponge kidney (A) is a benign congenital disorder characterized by the presence of dilated collecting tubules in the medulla of the kidney. It typically presents with recurrent kidney stones and is not associated with the findings seen in this patient.
- Simple renal cysts (B) are common and usually asymptomatic. They are typically solitary and do not cause the bilateral, nontender upper abdominal masses seen in this patient.
- Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (D) is a rare genetic disorder that presents in infancy or childhood with enlarged kidneys and liver, as well as other systemic manifestations. It is not consistent with the patient's age and clinical presentation.
- Obstructive cystic dysplasia (E) is a congenital disorder characterized by the presence of cysts and abnormal development of the kidneys. It typically presents in infancy or childhood and is not consistent with the patient's age and clinical presentation.",
"A 39-year-old African-American woman presents to the emergency room with hip pain. She has a past medical history significant for sarcoidosis which was recently diagnosed 6 months ago and is currently being treated. She reports that the pain started 2 weeks ago and is localized to the left hip and groin. The pain has been getting progressively more intense. Her temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mm Hg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain with manipulation without restriction of range of motion of the hip. Which of the following is the most sensitive test for this condition?
Options:
(A): CT of the hip
(B): MRI of the hip
(C): Radiograph of the hip
(D): Radionuclide scan of the hip
(E): Ultrasound of the hip
",MRI of the hip,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) MRI of the hip.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presents with hip pain localized to the left hip and groin, which has been progressively getting worse. The physical exam shows pain with manipulation but without restriction of range of motion of the hip. Given the clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is avascular necrosis (AVN) of the hip, which can be a complication of sarcoidosis.

MRI of the hip is the most sensitive test for detecting AVN. It can identify early changes in the bone and surrounding soft tissues, such as bone marrow edema and joint effusion, which may not be visible on other imaging modalities like radiographs or CT scans. MRI can also help determine the extent and severity of AVN, which is important for guiding treatment decisions.

CT of the hip may be useful for evaluating bony structures and detecting fractures, but it is not as sensitive as MRI for detecting early changes of AVN.

Radiograph of the hip may show late-stage changes of AVN, such as joint space narrowing and collapse of the femoral head, but it is not sensitive enough to detect early changes.

Radionuclide scan of the hip, such as a bone scan, can be used to evaluate for bone metastases or infection, but it is not specific for AVN and may not be as sensitive as MRI.

Ultrasound of the hip is not typically used for evaluating AVN and may not provide sufficient detail to assess the bone and surrounding structures.

Therefore, MRI of the hip is the most appropriate and sensitive test for evaluating this patient with hip pain and suspected AVN.",
"A 22-year-old man from Nepal presents to the emergency department complaining of swelling and pain in his right testicle. The patient states that he just arrived in the United States to live with his wife, with whom he is monogamous. The patient denies painful urination or urethral discharge, but admits that 10 days ago he “felt like he had a fever” and the right side of his face was swollen and painful. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine
(B): Dilation of the pampiniform plexus
(C): Original presentation in the form of a painless chancre
(D): Cause buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes
(E): Is a common cause of septic arthritis in this patient’s age group
",Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Preventable by a live attenuated vaccine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of swelling and pain in the right testicle, along with a history of fever and facial swelling, the most likely diagnosis is mumps orchitis. Mumps is a viral infection caused by the mumps virus, which can lead to inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males. 

Mumps is preventable by a live attenuated vaccine, which is part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in many countries, including the United States. The vaccine provides long-lasting immunity against the mumps virus and significantly reduces the risk of developing mumps and its complications, such as orchitis.

Dilation of the pampiniform plexus (B) is not characteristic of mumps orchitis. The pampiniform plexus refers to the network of veins that drain the testicles, and dilation of these veins is seen in conditions such as varicocele, not mumps orchitis.

Original presentation in the form of a painless chancre (C) is characteristic of syphilis, not mumps orchitis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, and it typically presents with a painless ulcer called a chancre at the site of infection.

Causing buboes in the inguinal lymph nodes (D) is characteristic of bubonic plague, not mumps orchitis. Bubonic plague is a bacterial infection caused by Yersinia pestis, and it can cause painful swollen lymph nodes called buboes.

Mumps is not a common cause of septic arthritis (E) in this patient's age group. Septic arthritis refers to joint inflammation caused by an infection, usually bacterial. While mumps can cause inflammation in various parts of the body, it is not a common cause of septic arthritis.",
"A 27-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient reports severe pelvic pain. Pregnancy has been complicated by gestational diabetes. Pregnancy and delivery of her first child were uncomplicated. Current medications include insulin, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Vital signs are within normal limits. The cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated; the vertex is at -1 station. The fetal heart rate is reactive with no decelerations. Epidural anesthesia is performed and the patient's symptoms improve. Ten minutes later, the patient has dizziness. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's hypotension?
Options:
(A): Decreased cardiac contractility
(B): Sympathetic block
(C): Hypovolemia
(D): Acute pulmonary hypertension
(E): Aortocaval compression
",Sympathetic block,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Sympathetic block.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of dizziness, along with a decrease in blood pressure, are consistent with hypotension. The most likely cause of hypotension in this scenario is a sympathetic block, which is a common side effect of epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia blocks sympathetic nerve fibers, leading to vasodilation and decreased systemic vascular resistance. This can result in hypotension. The patient's symptoms improving after the epidural anesthesia and the timing of the onset of symptoms (10 minutes later) further support the diagnosis of a sympathetic block as the underlying cause of the hypotension. Decreased cardiac contractility (choice A) would not typically present with dizziness and would not be expected to occur immediately after epidural anesthesia. Hypovolemia (choice C) would present with other signs such as tachycardia and decreased urine output. Acute pulmonary hypertension (choice D) would present with symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and cyanosis. Aortocaval compression (choice E) would typically present with symptoms such as lower extremity edema and discomfort, but not dizziness.",
"A 57-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance for dysarthria and left-sided facial droop. She is accompanied by her son, who states that the patient had just returned home an hour ago from walking the dog when suddenly the patient stated she felt “strange.” When her son asked her what was wrong, her speech was slurred and her ""face looked funny.” The son quickly called an ambulance. The paramedic upon arrival noted that the patient had left-sided facial droop. Her medical history includes asthma and sickle cell disease. She takes hydroxyurea, uses oxycodone as needed for pain, and an albuterol inhaler as needed for shortness of breath. The patient’s temperature is 97°F (36.1°C), blood pressure is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 93/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. On physical examination, a left-sided facial droop is appreciated. She has trouble articulating her words, and her speech is garbled. She is put on 2 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Labs are obtained and pending. Which of the following therapies is most likely indicated?
Options:
(A): Alteplase
(B): Exchange transfusion
(C): Hydralazine
(D): Naloxone
(E): Warfarin
",Exchange transfusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Exchange transfusion.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of sudden onset dysarthria and left-sided facial droop, along with the history of sickle cell disease, the most likely diagnosis is a stroke. Sickle cell disease is a risk factor for stroke, and the patient's symptoms are consistent with an ischemic stroke. 

Alteplase (option A) is a thrombolytic agent used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, it is contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease due to the risk of hemorrhagic transformation.

Hydralazine (option C) is an antihypertensive medication that is not indicated in this patient's presentation. The blood pressure provided in the question (145/72 mmHg) is not significantly elevated and does not require immediate treatment.

Naloxone (option D) is an opioid receptor antagonist used for the reversal of opioid overdose. It is not indicated in this patient's presentation.

Warfarin (option E) is an anticoagulant medication used for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic events. However, it is not indicated in the acute management of an ischemic stroke.

Exchange transfusion (option B) is the most appropriate therapy in this patient. Exchange transfusion is used in patients with sickle cell disease who present with acute neurologic symptoms, such as stroke. It helps to reduce the percentage of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and increase the percentage of normal hemoglobin (HbA), thereby improving oxygen delivery to the brain and reducing the risk of further ischemic injury.",
"A 58-year-old male is hospitalized after sustaining multiple fractures in a severe automobile accident. Soon after hospitalization, he develops respiratory distress with crackles present bilaterally on physical examination. The patient does not respond to mechanical ventilation and 100% oxygen and quickly dies due to respiratory insufficiency. Autopsy reveals heavy, red lungs and histology is shown in Image A. Which of the following is most likely to have been present in this patient shortly before death:
Options:
(A): Diaphragmatic hypertrophy
(B): Proliferation of bronchiolar mucous glands
(C): Interstitial edema
(D): Large pulmonary embolus
(E): Left apical bronchoalveolar carcinoma
",Interstitial edema,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Interstitial edema.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario developed respiratory distress with crackles present bilaterally on physical examination. This suggests a problem with the lungs, specifically the alveoli, which are responsible for gas exchange. The autopsy findings of heavy, red lungs further support the presence of a lung pathology.

The histology image shows thickened alveolar walls with widened interstitial spaces, which is characteristic of interstitial edema. Interstitial edema occurs when fluid accumulates in the interstitial spaces of the lungs, impairing gas exchange. This can lead to respiratory distress and ultimately respiratory insufficiency, as seen in this patient.

Diaphragmatic hypertrophy (A) refers to an enlargement of the diaphragm muscle, which is not relevant to the patient's presentation.

Proliferation of bronchiolar mucous glands (B) is seen in chronic bronchitis, but this is not consistent with the acute onset of respiratory distress in this patient.

Large pulmonary embolus (D) would cause a sudden blockage of blood flow to the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress. However, the autopsy findings of heavy, red lungs and the histology image do not support this diagnosis.

Left apical bronchoalveolar carcinoma (E) would present with localized symptoms and findings, such as a persistent cough, hemoptysis, or a lung mass on imaging. This is not consistent with the bilateral crackles and diffuse lung involvement seen in this patient.",
"A 6-year-old African American boy is referred to the hospital by his family physician for jaundice, normocytic anemia, and severe bone pain. He has a history of several episodes of mild bone pain in the past treated with over the counter analgesics. On physical examination, the child is icteric with nonspecific pain in his hands. His hands are swollen, tender, and warm. There is no chest pain, abdominal pain, fever, or hematuria. A complete metabolic panel and complete blood count with manual differential are performed:
Total bilirubin
8.4 mg/dL
WBC
9,800/mm3
Hemoglobin 
6.5 g/dL
MCV 82.3 fL
Platelet count  465,000/mm3
Reticulocyte 7%
Peripheral blood smear shows multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnant. The patient's hemoglobin electrophoresis result is pictured below. What is the most likely cause of his condition?
Options:
(A): Sickle cell trait
(B): Sickle cell disease
(C): Hemoglobin F
(D): Hemoglobin SC
(E): HbC
",Sickle cell disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Sickle cell disease.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of jaundice, normocytic anemia, severe bone pain, and hand swelling is consistent with sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is an inherited disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin, specifically hemoglobin S (HbS). In sickle cell disease, the abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped, leading to vaso-occlusive episodes and tissue damage.

The peripheral blood smear showing multiple clumps of elongated and curved cells and erythrocytes with nuclear remnants is characteristic of sickle cell disease. These abnormal red blood cells can occlude blood vessels, leading to tissue ischemia and pain.

The patient's hemoglobin electrophoresis result would show a predominance of hemoglobin S (HbS) and a decreased amount of normal hemoglobin (HbA). This confirms the diagnosis of sickle cell disease.

Sickle cell trait (choice A) is a carrier state for sickle cell disease, where an individual has one copy of the abnormal hemoglobin gene and one copy of the normal hemoglobin gene. Sickle cell trait typically does not cause symptoms or complications.

Hemoglobin F (choice C) refers to fetal hemoglobin, which is the main hemoglobin present in newborns. Hemoglobin F levels decrease after birth and are replaced by adult hemoglobin (HbA). Elevated levels of hemoglobin F can be seen in certain conditions, such as beta-thalassemia, but it is not the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Hemoglobin SC (choice D) is a different type of sickle cell disorder where an individual has one copy of the HbS gene and one copy of the hemoglobin C (HbC) gene. Hemoglobin SC disease can cause similar symptoms to sickle cell disease, but the patient's hemoglobin electrophoresis result does not show the presence of hemoglobin C.

HbC (choice E) is another abnormal hemoglobin variant, but it does not cause the characteristic sickling of red blood cells seen in sickle cell disease. The patient's peripheral blood smear and hemoglobin electrophoresis result are not consistent with HbC disease.",
"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with complaints of nausea, vomiting, palpitations, and dizziness, which have lasted for the past 3 hours. He was diagnosed with heart failure 1 year ago. During his last visit to his primary care physician, he was doing well and the lab results were normal. He reports that he has been taking low-dose aspirin and digoxin regularly for 1 year, and verapamil was recently added to prevent his frequent migraine headaches. An electrocardiogram is performed urgently and shows paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block. Suspecting digitalis toxicity, the emergency medicine physician sends blood to the lab for a serum digoxin level, which is 3.7 ng/mL (therapeutic range: 0.8–2 ng/mL). Which of the following mechanisms most likely explains the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient?
Options:
(A): Drug-induced hypokalemia
(B): Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin
(C): Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme
(D): Inhibition of P-glycoprotein
(E): Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin
",Inhibition of P-glycoprotein,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Inhibition of P-glycoprotein.

Explanation:
Digitalis toxicity occurs when the serum digoxin level exceeds the therapeutic range. In this patient, the serum digoxin level is 3.7 ng/mL, which is above the therapeutic range of 0.8-2 ng/mL. The most likely mechanism for the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient is the inhibition of P-glycoprotein.

P-glycoprotein is an efflux transporter that is responsible for the elimination of digoxin from the body. It is expressed in the intestines, liver, and kidneys. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein can lead to increased absorption of digoxin from the intestines and decreased elimination of digoxin from the body, resulting in higher serum levels and increased risk of toxicity.

In this patient, the addition of verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, may have inhibited P-glycoprotein, leading to increased absorption and decreased elimination of digoxin. This, in turn, resulted in higher serum digoxin levels and the development of digitalis toxicity.

The other options are not the most likely mechanisms for the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient:

(A) Drug-induced hypokalemia: While hypokalemia can promote digoxin-induced arrhythmias, it is not the most likely mechanism in this patient as there is no mention of hypokalemia in the clinical scenario.

(B) Increased intestinal absorption of digoxin: This mechanism is possible, but it is not the most likely explanation in this patient. The addition of verapamil, which inhibits P-glycoprotein, is a more plausible explanation.

(C) Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme: Inhibition of CYP 3A4 isoenzyme can increase the serum levels of certain drugs, but it is not the most likely mechanism for the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient.

(E) Increased enterohepatic circulation of digoxin: While enterohepatic circulation can contribute to the prolongation of the half-life of digoxin, it is not the most likely mechanism for the development of digitalis toxicity in this patient. The inhibition of P-glycoprotein is a more plausible explanation.",
"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 25 minutes after being involved in a high speed motor-vehicle collision in which he was an unrestrained passenger. He has acute myeloid leukemia and is currently receiving chemotherapy. On arrival, his temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 63/min, respirations are 10/min, and blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and sluggish. There are multiple bruises over the face, trunk, and right upper and lower extremities. There is a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over his right cheek. He does not respond to any commands, but does groan. Painful stimuli cause him to open his eyes and withdraw all extremities. There are decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. There is tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. There is swelling of the right elbow and wrist. The right lower extremity is shorter than the left lower extremity. There are 2 lacerations around 2 cm (0.8 in) each on the right leg. The right knee is swollen. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Focussed assessment sonography for trauma (FAST)
(B): Insertion of intercostal chest tube
(C): CT scan of the head and neck
(D): X-rays of the extremities
(E): Intubation and mechanical ventilation
",Intubation and mechanical ventilation,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, it is evident that he has sustained multiple injuries, including facial laceration, decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall, and swelling of the right elbow, wrist, and knee. Additionally, the patient is not responding to commands and has a decreased level of consciousness. These findings suggest that the patient is experiencing significant trauma and may have sustained injuries to the head, chest, and extremities.

Given the patient's decreased respiratory rate and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base, there is concern for a possible pneumothorax or hemothorax. These conditions can lead to respiratory compromise and require immediate intervention. Intubation and mechanical ventilation would help support the patient's breathing and ensure adequate oxygenation.

While a focused assessment sonography for trauma (FAST) may be useful in evaluating for intra-abdominal bleeding, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's decreased breath sounds and tenderness to palpation over the left chest wall suggest a more urgent need for intervention.

Insertion of an intercostal chest tube may be necessary if there is evidence of a pneumothorax or hemothorax, but this should be done after intubation and mechanical ventilation to stabilize the patient's respiratory status.

A CT scan of the head and neck may be indicated to evaluate for any traumatic brain injury or cervical spine injury, but this should not be the initial step in management. The patient's respiratory compromise takes priority.

X-rays of the extremities may be useful in evaluating for fractures or dislocations, but this should not be the initial step in management. The patient's respiratory compromise and potential life-threatening injuries take priority.

In summary, given the patient's significant trauma, decreased respiratory rate, and decreased breath sounds, the most appropriate next step in management is intubation and mechanical ventilation to support the patient's breathing and ensure adequate oxygenation.",
"A 51-year-old woman was recently diagnosed with type II diabetes. Due to the cumulative effects of diabetes, various health screenings and vaccinations are routinely recommended. Which of the following vaccinations or screening measures are recommended in patients with diabetes?
Options:
(A): Urinalysis every 6 months
(B): Comprehensive foot exam every year
(C): Weekly foot inspections by patient or family member
(D): Hepatitis A vaccination series
(E): Meningococcal vaccine
",Comprehensive foot exam every year,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Comprehensive foot exam every year.

Explanation:
Patients with diabetes are at an increased risk for foot complications, such as neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Therefore, it is recommended that patients with diabetes undergo a comprehensive foot exam every year. This exam should include an assessment of the patient's ability to see and reach their feet, as well as an evaluation for any signs of neuropathy or peripheral artery disease. Regular foot inspections by the patient or a family member (option C) are also important, but they should be done more frequently than once a week. Urinalysis every 6 months (option A) is not a routine screening measure for patients with diabetes. Hepatitis A vaccination series (option D) and meningococcal vaccine (option E) are not specifically recommended for patients with diabetes unless they have other risk factors for these infections.",
"A 23-year-old man presents with sudden loss of consciousness while pitching in a baseball game. There is no history of injury. Consciousness is regained after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Past medical history is negative for any neurological and cardiovascular problems. Physical examination reveals a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse and a double apical impulse. There are no audible murmurs. An S4 is present. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Dilated cardiomyopathy
(B): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(C): Aortic stenosis
(D): Takotsubo cardiomyopathy
(E): Restrictive cardiomyopathy
",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Explanation:
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle, most commonly involving the interventricular septum. It is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes.

The sudden loss of consciousness in this patient is likely due to a cardiac arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which can occur in HCM. The absence of a history of injury and the presence of a prominent A wave on the jugular venous pulse suggest impaired ventricular filling, which is characteristic of HCM. The double apical impulse is caused by the hypertrophied left ventricle pushing against the right ventricle during systole. The presence of an S4 is also consistent with HCM.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (choice A) is characterized by dilation of the ventricles and impaired systolic function. It typically presents with symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea and fatigue. The physical examination findings in this patient are not consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy.

Aortic stenosis (choice C) is characterized by a systolic ejection murmur, which is not present in this patient. The physical examination findings in this patient are not consistent with aortic stenosis.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (choice D) is a transient condition characterized by acute left ventricular dysfunction, typically triggered by emotional or physical stress. It is more common in postmenopausal women. The physical examination findings in this patient are not consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Restrictive cardiomyopathy (choice E) is characterized by impaired ventricular filling due to stiffening of the ventricular walls. It typically presents with symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea and fatigue. The physical examination findings in this patient are not consistent with restrictive cardiomyopathy.",
"A 39-year-old man is brought to the emergency department unconscious following 2 episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. According to the attendants, he has complained of recurrent headaches for the past 2 weeks. There is no history of fever, head trauma, or a seizure disorder. The patient does not smoke cigarettes but reportedly drinks 2 glasses of wine daily. He has multiple sexual partners and history regarding the contraceptive use is unavailable. The patient’s vitals include: blood pressure 137/88 mm Hg, temperature 37.2°C (99.0°F). On physical examination, he is obtunded. He grimaces on pain and localizes in response to pain in both upper extremities. Pupils are bilateral 3-mm in diameter and equally round and reactive. Laboratory tests are within normal limits. An MRI of the brain with contrast is shown in the exhibit (see image). A brain biopsy is performed that reveals perivascular clusters of lymphocytes. Which of the following is most associated with this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Epstein-Barr virus
(B): Human herpes virus
(C): Human papilloma virus
(D): Human T-lymphotropic virus
(E): Schistosoma haematobium
",Epstein-Barr virus,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Epstein-Barr virus.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with recurrent headaches, seizures, and perivascular clusters of lymphocytes on brain biopsy is consistent with a diagnosis of viral encephalitis. Among the options given, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is most commonly associated with viral encephalitis. EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and is known to cause infectious mononucleosis. It can also cause neurological complications, including encephalitis. The presence of perivascular clusters of lymphocytes on brain biopsy is a characteristic finding in EBV encephalitis. Other symptoms of EBV encephalitis may include fever, altered mental status, and focal neurological deficits. Treatment typically involves antiviral medications and supportive care.",
"A 22-year-old woman from a rural area who recently discovered she was pregnant is referred for a cardiology consultation due to cyanosis, dyspnea, and a cardiac murmur revealed at the initial prenatal visit. She is gravida 1, para 0 with an estimated gestational age of 19 weeks. She says that the murmur was found in her childhood, and the doctor at that time placed her under observation only. However, she has been lost to follow-up and has not had proper follow up in years. Currently, she complains of dizziness and occasional dyspnea on exertion which has gradually increased during her pregnancy. Prior to her pregnancy, she did not have any symptoms. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/60 mm Hg, heart rate 81/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F). Her examination is significant for acrocyanosis and a fixed splitting of S2 and grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur best heard over the left upper sternal border. Which of the following physiological pregnancy changes is causing the change in this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Increase in pulmonary vascular resistance
(B): Increase in heart rate
(C): Decrease in systemic vascular resistance
(D): Increase in cardiac output
(E): Increase in blood volume
",Decrease in systemic vascular resistance,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Decrease in systemic vascular resistance.

Explanation:
During pregnancy, there are several physiological changes that occur in the cardiovascular system. One of these changes is a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This is due to the hormonal and mechanical changes that occur during pregnancy. 

The decrease in systemic vascular resistance allows for increased blood flow to the uterus and placenta, which is necessary for the growing fetus. However, in some cases, this decrease in systemic vascular resistance can exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions or lead to the development of new cardiac symptoms.

In this case, the patient has a history of a cardiac murmur and has developed symptoms of cyanosis, dyspnea, and dizziness during her pregnancy. These symptoms are suggestive of a worsening of her cardiac condition. The fixed splitting of S2 and the grade 3/6 midsystolic murmur heard over the left upper sternal border are consistent with a congenital heart defect, such as an atrial septal defect (ASD).

The decrease in systemic vascular resistance during pregnancy can lead to an increase in blood flow through the ASD, resulting in increased right-to-left shunting of blood and worsening of symptoms. This is why the decrease in systemic vascular resistance is causing the change in this patient's condition.

It is important for this patient to be referred for further evaluation and management of her cardiac condition, as she may require intervention or close monitoring during her pregnancy.",
"A 25-year-old man with a past medical history of constipation and fibromyalgia presents to the emergency department with generalized malaise and severe diarrhea. The patient states that he has not felt well for the past 24 hours and his symptoms are no longer tolerable. He denies taking any medications or illicit drugs and states he is generally healthy. His temperature is 99.3°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 122/88 mmHg, pulse is 107/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam demonstrates an ill appearing young man. Physical exam is notable for rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and piloerection. The patient’s pupils are dilated and reactive to light. During placement of an ultrasound guided IV, multiple scars are noted in the antecubital fossa, and it is noted that it is very difficult to place an IV in this patient. During the exam, he begins actively vomiting. Which of the following could be an appropriate treatment for this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Clonidine
(B): Diazepam taper
(C): Haloperidol and diphenhydramine
(D): Naloxone
(E): Oseltamivir
",Clonidine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Clonidine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical exam findings, it is likely that he is experiencing opioid withdrawal. The symptoms of generalized malaise, severe diarrhea, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, piloerection, dilated pupils, and difficulty placing an IV are consistent with opioid withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal can occur in individuals who have been using opioids regularly and then suddenly stop or reduce their use.

Clonidine is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that can be used to manage the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. It works by reducing the release of norepinephrine, which helps to alleviate symptoms such as anxiety, agitation, and autonomic hyperactivity. Clonidine can also help with diarrhea and vomiting.

Diazepam taper (B) may be used to manage alcohol withdrawal, but it is not the appropriate treatment for opioid withdrawal.

Haloperidol and diphenhydramine (C) are typically used to manage symptoms of delirium or agitation, but they are not the first-line treatment for opioid withdrawal.

Naloxone (D) is an opioid receptor antagonist that is used to reverse opioid overdose. It is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal.

Oseltamivir (E) is an antiviral medication used to treat influenza, but it is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal.",
"A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with her husband to discuss her most recent problem. She and her husband recently bought a new house in the area. While cleaning the house, they discovered a nest of spiders. She reports blacking out and waking up outside the house with a bandage on her arm. Her husband says that she began screaming and ran out of the house, breaking a window, and cutting her arm. The patient says she has tried to enter the house several times over the last several months but can not bring herself to cross the threshold for fear of more spiders. She wants to overcome her extreme and irrational fear. Which of the following is the most effective treatment to overcome this patient’s arachnophobia?
Options:
(A): Desensitization
(B): Paroxetine
(C): Metoprolol
(D): Alprazolam
(E): Psychotherapy
",Desensitization,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Desensitization.

Explanation:
Desensitization, also known as exposure therapy, is the most effective treatment for specific phobias such as arachnophobia. This therapy involves gradually exposing the patient to the feared object or situation in a controlled and safe manner. In the case of arachnophobia, the patient would be exposed to spiders in a gradual and systematic way, starting with less anxiety-provoking situations (such as looking at pictures of spiders) and gradually progressing to more challenging situations (such as being in the same room as a spider).

Desensitization works by helping the patient to confront their fear and gradually learn that the feared object or situation is not actually dangerous. Through repeated exposure and the use of relaxation techniques, the patient's anxiety response decreases over time. This therapy has been shown to be highly effective in reducing phobic symptoms and improving overall functioning.

The other options listed are not the most effective treatments for arachnophobia:
- Paroxetine (B) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for specific phobias.
- Metoprolol (C) is a beta-blocker used to treat high blood pressure and certain heart conditions. It is not indicated for the treatment of specific phobias.
- Alprazolam (D) is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for specific phobias.
- Psychotherapy (E) is a broad term that encompasses various therapeutic approaches, including desensitization. While psychotherapy can be helpful for treating phobias, desensitization specifically targets the fear response and is considered the most effective treatment for specific phobias.",
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the physician because of increasing forgetfulness, unsteadiness, and falls over the past year. He reports that these symptoms seem to worsen with each fall. Initially, he could not remember directions to his home but now cannot remember recent conversations or appointments he has made. He often repeats questions that he asked shortly before. He has long-standing hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia. Current medications include aspirin, carvedilol, enalapril, and atorvastatin. Examination shows a bruise over the left temple and an unsteady gait. On mental status examination, he is oriented to place and person only. Short-term memory is impaired; he can recall 0 out of 5 objects after 10 minutes. Long-term memory is intact. He has no delusions or hallucinations. Muscle strength is decreased in the left lower extremity. The Babinski sign is present on the left. A CT scan of the head is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Warfarin therapy
(B): Vitamin E therapy
(C): Cerebral shunting
(D): Tetrabenazine therapy
(E): Cognitive training
",Cognitive training,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Cognitive training.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is caused by impaired blood flow to the brain, leading to cognitive decline. Risk factors for vascular dementia include hypertension, coronary artery disease, and hypercholesterolemia, all of which the patient has. The presence of an unsteady gait, bruise over the left temple, and decreased muscle strength in the left lower extremity suggest that the patient may have had a recent fall, which could have caused a head injury and further worsened his cognitive symptoms.

The next step in management for vascular dementia is cognitive training. Cognitive training involves exercises and activities that aim to improve cognitive function, such as memory, attention, and problem-solving skills. It can help slow down the progression of cognitive decline and improve the patient's quality of life. Other treatment options, such as medication, may be considered depending on the severity of symptoms and the underlying cause of vascular dementia, but cognitive training is the most appropriate initial step.",
"A 28-year-old primigravid woman at 39 weeks gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. On examination, the cervix is 100% effaced and 10 cm dilated. After 5 minutes of pushing, there is a prolonged deceleration of the fetal heart rate to 90/min. A decision to perform an episiotomy is made to expedite vaginal delivery. The anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. The anesthetized nerve most likely also supplies which of the following structures?
Options:
(A): Obturator externus muscle
(B): Skin of the lateral thigh
(C): External anal sphincter
(D): Skin of the mons pubis
(E): Detrusor muscle
",External anal sphincter,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) External anal sphincter.

Explanation:
During an episiotomy, the anesthesiologist locates the ischial spines by palpating the posterolateral vaginal sidewall and administers an anesthetic. Three minutes later, pinching the posterior vulva does not provoke pain. This indicates that the anesthetic has successfully blocked the nerve supply to the area. The nerve most likely anesthetized in this case is the pudendal nerve, which supplies sensation to the perineum, including the external anal sphincter. Therefore, the anesthetized nerve also supplies the external anal sphincter.",
"A 55-year-old woman with a history of HIV presents to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea, fever, and dry cough for the past 4 days. She has not been compliant with antiretroviral or prophylactic medication. On evaluation, the patient is in moderate respiratory distress. The temperature is 38.8°C (102.0°F), the blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, the pulse is 96/min, and the respiratory rate is 20/min. Pulse oximetry is 92% on 4 L oxygen by nasal cannula. Her CD4 count is 180 cells/μL. IV antibiotics and glucocorticoids are administered. After 30 minutes, the patient develops severe respiratory distress. Repeat vital signs show: temperature 38.3°C (101.0°F), blood pressure 80/50 mm Hg, pulse 104/min, respiration rate 32/min and pulse oximetry 85% on nasal cannula. The trachea deviates to the left. Breath sounds are absent on the right side and the neck veins are distended. Telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Discontinue antibiotics
(B): Administer epinephrine
(C): Perform an arterial blood gas
(D): Needle thoracostomy
(E): Stat chest X-ray
",Needle thoracostomy,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Needle thoracostomy.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with tension pneumothorax, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Tension pneumothorax occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and cannot escape, leading to increased pressure on the mediastinum and compromised cardiac output. 

The patient's severe respiratory distress, decreased oxygen saturation, absent breath sounds on the right side, distended neck veins, and deviation of the trachea to the left are all indicative of tension pneumothorax. The absence of breath sounds on the right side suggests that the lung has collapsed, and the deviation of the trachea to the left indicates a shift of the mediastinum.

The best next step in the management of this patient is a needle thoracostomy. This procedure involves inserting a large-bore needle into the affected pleural space to release the trapped air and relieve the pressure. It is a temporizing measure that can be performed at the bedside to stabilize the patient's condition before definitive treatment, such as chest tube placement, can be performed.

Discontinuing antibiotics (A) is not the correct next step because the patient's respiratory distress is not likely due to an adverse reaction to the antibiotics. Administering epinephrine (B) is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with anaphylaxis. Performing an arterial blood gas (C) may provide additional information about the patient's respiratory status, but it does not address the underlying cause of the severe respiratory distress. A stat chest X-ray (E) may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of tension pneumothorax, but it is not the most urgent next step in management.",
"A 22-year-old woman with polycystic ovarian syndrome comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of left lower abdominal pain that began suddenly while she was running. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. Physical examination shows tenderness to palpation over the left adnexa and rebound tenderness in the left lower quadrant. There is no tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Urine pregnancy test is negative. An ultrasound is ordered to confirm the diagnosis of ruptured ovarian cyst. Visualization of fluid in which of the following locations would be most consistent with this diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Lesser sac
(B): Rectouterine pouch
(C): Hepatorenal space
(D): Splenorenal angle
(E): Rectovesical pouch
",Rectouterine pouch,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Rectouterine pouch.

Explanation:
The rectouterine pouch, also known as the pouch of Douglas, is the most dependent part of the peritoneal cavity in the female pelvis. It is located between the rectum and the uterus. 

In the case of a ruptured ovarian cyst, fluid from the cyst can accumulate in the rectouterine pouch. This accumulation of fluid can be visualized on ultrasound, confirming the diagnosis of a ruptured ovarian cyst.

The other options, such as the lesser sac, hepatorenal space, splenorenal angle, and rectovesical pouch, are not typically associated with the accumulation of fluid in the context of a ruptured ovarian cyst.",
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She has noticed trembling of her hands for the past 5 months. These movements are only present when she reaches to pick up an object or answer the phone. She has a history of major depressive disorder but has been off medications for the past 3 years. Her father had Parkinson's disease and died 6 months ago. She drinks a glass of wine daily. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 118/74 mm Hg. A low-frequency tremor is present that worsens as she reaches out for an object. She consistently overshoots her target. There is no tremor present when her arms are held outstretched. There is increased tone in the lower extremities and Babinski's sign is positive bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Cerebellar demyelination
(B): Degenerated substantia nigra
(C): Degenerated caudate nucleus
(D): Essential tremor
(E): Subthalamic nucleus stroke
""
",Cerebellar demyelination,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Cerebellar demyelination.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely cause of her symptoms is cerebellar demyelination. The patient presents with a low-frequency tremor that worsens with movement, consistent with an intention tremor. This type of tremor is characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction. Additionally, the patient consistently overshoots her target, which is a sign of dysmetria, another feature of cerebellar dysfunction. The absence of tremor when her arms are held outstretched further supports a cerebellar etiology.

The patient's history of major depressive disorder and family history of Parkinson's disease are not consistent with the presentation and findings in this case. While Parkinson's disease can cause a resting tremor, it typically does not present with intention tremor or dysmetria. The degeneration of the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus, and subthalamic nucleus are all associated with Parkinson's disease, but these structures are not primarily involved in cerebellar function.

Ammonia build-up is associated with hepatic encephalopathy, which can cause tremor, but the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of liver disease.

Essential tremor is a common cause of tremor, but it typically presents with a high-frequency tremor that is not worsened by movement. Additionally, essential tremor does not typically cause dysmetria or other signs of cerebellar dysfunction.

A subthalamic nucleus stroke can cause a contralateral hemiballismus or chorea, but it would not explain the patient's intention tremor, dysmetria, or increased tone in the lower extremities.",
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician because of generalized pruritus and raised, erythematous plaques on the skin over his hands, chest, and legs for 6 hours. He reports having clear liquid discharge from his nose and sneezing. He says that his symptoms began suddenly the previous night, 30 minutes after he had dinner at a seafood restaurant. He has had similar symptoms occasionally in the past as well. Four months ago, he had an episode of narrow-angle glaucoma. He takes no medications. His vital signs are within normal limits. Nasal exam shows clear, serous secretions, with edematous and erythematous mucosa and turbinates. Paranasal sinuses are not tender to palpation. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Diphenhydramine
(B): Amoxicillin
(C): Fexofenadine
(D): Vitamin K
(E): Calamine lotion
",Fexofenadine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Fexofenadine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of pruritus, raised erythematous plaques on the skin, clear liquid discharge from the nose, and sneezing, it is likely that he is experiencing an allergic reaction. The fact that his symptoms began suddenly after eating seafood suggests that he may be having an allergic reaction to seafood, known as seafood allergy.

Fexofenadine is a second-generation antihistamine that is commonly used to relieve symptoms of allergic reactions, such as itching, sneezing, and runny nose. It is a non-sedating antihistamine, which means that it does not cause drowsiness like older antihistamines such as diphenhydramine.

Amoxicillin is an antibiotic and would not be appropriate for treating an allergic reaction. Vitamin K is used to treat deficiencies in vitamin K, which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Calamine lotion is a topical treatment for itching and skin irritation, but it would not address the patient's systemic symptoms of sneezing and clear liquid discharge from the nose.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient would be fexofenadine to relieve his allergic symptoms.",
"A 19-year-old man in a 3-month relationship with a woman experiences frequent sexual fantasies about male coworkers. He lives in a conservative community and does not know any openly gay men. Two days ago, he joined a local group considered by many organizations to be a hate group. Together with the other members, he attacked a gay couple on their way home from dinner. Which of the following psychological defense mechanisms is he demonstrating?
Options:
(A): Acting out
(B): Sublimation
(C): Reaction formation
(D): Intellectualization
(E): Projection
",Reaction formation,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Reaction formation.

Explanation:
Reaction formation is a psychological defense mechanism in which a person consciously adopts beliefs, attitudes, or behaviors that are opposite to their unconscious desires or impulses. In this case, the 19-year-old man is experiencing sexual fantasies about male coworkers, which suggests that he may have repressed or denied his own same-sex attraction. However, due to living in a conservative community and not knowing any openly gay men, he may feel conflicted or ashamed about these feelings.

By joining a hate group and attacking a gay couple, he is demonstrating a strong and exaggerated reaction against homosexuality. This behavior is a way for him to counteract his unconscious desires and impulses by adopting a hostile and aggressive stance towards homosexuality. It is important to note that reaction formation is considered an immature defense mechanism.

Acting out (A) refers to the direct expression of an unconscious wish or impulse in action, which does not apply to this scenario. Sublimation (B) refers to channeling unacceptable impulses into socially acceptable activities, which is not evident in this case. Intellectualization (D) involves avoiding emotions by focusing on intellectual aspects, which is not applicable here. Projection (E) involves attributing one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings to others, which is not demonstrated in this scenario.",
"A 66-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider with several days of left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin. The patient states that she has noticed a pink tinge to her urine as well. Of note, she has not had any fevers, but endorses several months of fatigue and constipation. The patient was previously healthy except for mild untreated hypertension. On exam, her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 130/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 12/min. On further workup, the patient is found to have calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis with hypercalciuria. Blood studies demonstrate increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
Options:
(A): Primary hyperparathyroidism
(B): Pseudohypoparathyroidism
(C): Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism
(D): Secondary hyperparathyroidism
(E): Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
",Primary hyperparathyroidism,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Explanation:
Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most likely cause in this patient. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more parathyroid glands, leading to hypercalcemia. The most common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism is a solitary parathyroid adenoma. In this patient, the increased PTH and hypercalcemia are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's symptoms of left flank pain radiating to the abdomen and groin, along with the pink tinge to her urine, are consistent with nephrolithiasis, which can occur as a result of hypercalcemia. The patient's history of fatigue and constipation may also be related to hypercalcemia.",
"A 23-year-old woman presents to her psychiatrist concerned about her mood. She has felt tired and unwilling to engage in any activities lately. She states that her limbs feel heavy all the time and that completing any activity takes tremendous effort. She no longer finds any happiness in activities that she previously enjoyed. She also states that she really struggles to sleep and at times can't sleep for several days. The patient is started on appropriate first-line therapy and sent home. She returns 1 week later stating that her symptoms have not improved. She is requesting help as her performance at work and school is suffering. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Add lithium to treatment regimen
(B): Change treatment to duloxetine
(C): Change treatment to lithium
(D): Continue current therapy
(E): Electroconvulsive therapy
",Continue current therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Continue current therapy.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with symptoms of depression, including low mood, fatigue, anhedonia (loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities), psychomotor retardation (feeling of heaviness in limbs and difficulty completing tasks), and sleep disturbances. The patient has been started on appropriate first-line therapy, which is likely an antidepressant medication.

It is important to note that antidepressant medications typically take several weeks to start showing their full effect. It is not uncommon for patients to experience a lack of improvement in symptoms after just one week of treatment. Therefore, it is recommended to continue the current therapy and reassess the patient's symptoms after a longer duration of treatment, typically around 4-6 weeks.

Changing the treatment to another medication, such as duloxetine or lithium, at this early stage would not be appropriate as the patient has not been given enough time to respond to the initial treatment. Adding lithium to the treatment regimen is also not indicated at this point, as lithium is typically used as an augmentation strategy in treatment-resistant depression.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a highly effective treatment for severe depression that has not responded to other interventions. However, it is usually reserved for cases where there is an urgent need for rapid improvement, such as when the patient is at risk of self-harm or suicide. In this case, the patient's symptoms have not improved after just one week, but there is no indication of severe or life-threatening symptoms that would necessitate ECT.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to continue the current therapy and reassess the patient's symptoms after a longer duration of treatment. It is important to closely monitor the patient's progress and consider other treatment options if there is still no improvement after an adequate trial of the initial therapy.",
"A 16-year-old patient presents to the physician’s office with an absence of menstruations. Her last period was 6 months ago. Since almost a year and a half ago, she intentionally restricted her diet at the expense of carbohydrates, exercised intensively, and lost 18.0 kg (39.7 lb). She had her menarche at the age of 12 and menstruated normally until last year. She is not sexually active. On physical examination, the vital signs include blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, heart rate 55/min, respiratory rate 12/min, and temperature 35.9°C (96.6°F). Her weight is 55.0 kg (121.3 lb), and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 5 in). Physical examination reveals the good development of muscles and decreased adiposity. A bone scan shows decreased calcium mineral deposits. Which statement about this patient’s condition is correct?
Options:
(A): Hypertrophied muscles are the source of additional androgens which interfere with the patient’s menstrual cycle
(B): This patient has insulin resistance
(C): Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient
(D): The patient is likely to have decreased blood estrogen concentration due to increased liver metabolism
(E): The patient should be checked for hyperthyroidism because such extensive lipolysis is likely to result from thyroid hyperfunction
",Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Decreased adiposity contributes to hypoestrogenemia in this patient.

Explanation:
The patient's history of intentional weight loss, restricted diet, and intensive exercise has led to a significant decrease in adiposity (body fat). Adipose tissue is an important source of estrogen production in the body. Estrogen is primarily produced in the ovaries, but adipose tissue also plays a role in estrogen synthesis through the conversion of androgens (male hormones) to estrogen. 

With decreased adiposity, there is a reduction in the production of estrogen, leading to hypoestrogenemia (low estrogen levels). This can result in menstrual irregularities or even amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), as seen in this patient. 

The other options are not correct:

(A): Hypertrophied muscles are not the source of additional androgens that interfere with the patient's menstrual cycle. In fact, increased muscle mass is not typically associated with hormonal imbalances that affect menstruation.

(B): There is no evidence to suggest that this patient has insulin resistance. The information provided does not indicate any symptoms or risk factors for insulin resistance.

(D): Increased liver metabolism leading to decreased blood estrogen concentration is not likely in this patient. The primary cause of hypoestrogenemia in this case is the decreased adiposity, not liver metabolism.

(E): While hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss and increased lipolysis, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination findings to suggest hyperthyroidism as the cause of her symptoms. The primary cause of her menstrual irregularities is the decreased adiposity.",
"A 7-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department with a 10-day history of fever and sore throat that acutely worsened over the past 2 days. Her sore throat is worse on the right side. She has difficulty swallowing and opening her mouth due to pain. She has also noticed a change in the quality of her voice over the last day. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg . Examination shows cervical lymphadenopathy.

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Intravenous dexamethasone therapy
(B): Tonsillectomy
(C): Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy
(D): Needle aspiration and oral clindamycin therapy
(E): Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy
",Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Incision and drainage with intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with peritonsillar abscess, which is a complication of acute tonsillitis. The symptoms of fever, sore throat, difficulty swallowing, and cervical lymphadenopathy are suggestive of a peritonsillar abscess. The physical examination findings of erythematous tonsils, swelling of the right tonsillar pillar, and deviation of the uvula to the left further support this diagnosis.

The most appropriate next step in management is incision and drainage of the abscess. This is necessary to relieve the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications. Incision and drainage can be performed in the emergency department under local anesthesia. It involves making an incision in the abscess to allow for drainage of pus. This procedure provides immediate relief of symptoms and helps to prevent the spread of infection.

In addition to incision and drainage, intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy should be initiated. This is the treatment of choice for peritonsillar abscess and provides coverage against the most common pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes and anaerobic bacteria. Intravenous antibiotics are necessary to ensure adequate tissue penetration and systemic treatment of the infection.

Intravenous dexamethasone therapy may be considered as an adjunctive treatment to reduce inflammation and swelling, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Tonsillectomy is not indicated as the initial treatment for peritonsillar abscess. Needle aspiration and oral clindamycin therapy may be considered in cases where incision and drainage is not feasible, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam therapy alone, without incision and drainage, would not adequately treat the abscess.",
"A 26-year-old nurse comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue. She has had a lot of stress at work and has been on sick leave for 2 weeks, but states that she would like to return to work. She has had several episodes of lower abdominal pain. She says, """"I know I have cancer."""" She requests a diagnostic laparoscopy. She was diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease 6 months ago. Her only medication is omeprazole. The patient appears pale.

Options:
(A): Factitious disorder
(B): Somatic symptom disorder
(C): Conversion disorder
(D): Primary hyperparathyroidism
(E): Acute small bowel hemorrhage
",Factitious disorder,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Factitious disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with factitious disorder. Factitious disorder is a psychiatric condition in which individuals intentionally produce or feign physical or psychological symptoms in order to assume the sick role and receive medical attention. Patients with factitious disorder often have a history of multiple hospitalizations, surgeries, and invasive procedures, as they seek validation and attention from healthcare providers. They may have a deep-seated need to be seen as ill or injured, and may go to great lengths to maintain their deception.

In this case, the patient's request for a diagnostic laparoscopy despite the lack of evidence for any organic cause of her symptoms is a red flag for factitious disorder. Additionally, her history of multiple episodes of lower abdominal pain, her belief that she has cancer despite no evidence to support this, and her request for invasive procedures all point towards factitious disorder.

The patient's physical examination findings, such as pale conjunctivae, dry mucous membranes, and crusts along the course of her left arm veins, suggest signs of self-inflicted harm, which is commonly seen in patients with factitious disorder.

Laboratory studies show a low hemoglobin level (7.5 g/dL) and a normal mean corpuscular volume (89 μm3), indicating anemia. This anemia is likely due to chronic blood loss from self-induced injuries or procedures. The patient's depressed mood and fatigue may be related to the underlying psychological distress associated with factitious disorder.

It is important to approach patients with factitious disorder with empathy and understanding, as they often have complex psychological needs that require appropriate psychiatric evaluation and treatment.",
"Five days after undergoing an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia while on a trip to Haiti, a 43-year-old woman develops low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. During the surgery, she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Three days after the surgery, she was stable enough to be transported back to the United States. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 138/76 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. Abdominal examination shows moderate tenderness over the liver. The liver is palpated 2 to 3 cm below the right costal margin. Laboratory studies show:

Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""
Options:
(A): Adverse effect of anesthetic
(B): Gram negative bacteria in the bloodstream
(C): Trauma to the bile duct
(D): Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
(E): Excessive lysis of red blood cells
",Adverse effect of anesthetic,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Adverse effect of anesthetic.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of low-grade fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the laboratory findings of jaundice, elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase), and elevated bilirubin levels, suggest hepatocellular injury. The enlarged liver on abdominal ultrasonography and the biopsy findings of massive centrilobular necrosis further support this diagnosis. The most likely cause of this hepatocellular injury is an adverse effect of the anesthetic used during the surgery. This is supported by the fact that the patient developed symptoms 5 days after the surgery, which is consistent with the time frame for drug-induced liver injury. Additionally, the patient's stable condition after the surgery and the absence of other risk factors for hepatocellular injury (such as alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or medication use) make an adverse effect of the anesthetic the most likely cause.",
"A 56-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of fatigue and painless bruising over her arms and trunk. She has also had several episodes of nosebleeds that resolved with compression after a few minutes. She recently completed treatment for a urinary tract infection. She has had no changes in her weight. She has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Her last menstrual cycle was 5 years ago. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Home medications include metformin, amlodipine, and enalapril. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. There are ecchymoses and petechiae over the upper extremities, chest, and back. There is no lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show:

Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): Serum transferrin level
(B): Bone marrow biopsy
(C): Flow cytometry
(D): Peripheral blood smear
(E): Serum porphobilinogen level
",Bone marrow biopsy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Bone marrow biopsy.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with pancytopenia (low red blood cells, low white blood cells, and low platelets) and bleeding symptoms, which raises concern for a bone marrow disorder. The most likely diagnosis in this case is aplastic anemia, which is characterized by hypocellular bone marrow and peripheral pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating a hypocellular marrow with replacement by fat cells and absence of hematopoietic cells. This can help differentiate aplastic anemia from other causes of pancytopenia, such as myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia. The other options listed are not appropriate for confirming the diagnosis of aplastic anemia in this case. Serum transferrin level is not specific for aplastic anemia and would not provide information about the bone marrow. Flow cytometry is used to analyze cell surface markers and is not specific for aplastic anemia. Peripheral blood smear may show some abnormalities, but it is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Serum porphobilinogen level is not relevant to the diagnosis of aplastic anemia.",
"A 35-year-old man returns to the clinic to follow up for his chronic stomach pain. At the last visit a few months ago, he explained that he had been experiencing discomfort in his upper abdomen for awhile. He had never vomited up any blood and had not had any substantial weight loss. He did not take any medications, did not smoke, and had no family history of gastric cancer. At that time, the doctor empirically started him on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Today, despite the PPI, the patient says he is still experiencing discomfort. Hearing this, the doctor decides to order a urease breath test. What is the most likely cause of this patient's chronic stomach pain?
Options:
(A): Gastric neoplasm
(B): Gastroesophgeal sphincter dysfunction
(C): Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(D): Heliobacter pylori infection
(E): Excessive gastrin
",Heliobacter pylori infection,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Heliobacter pylori infection.

Explanation:
The patient's chronic stomach pain, along with the lack of alarm symptoms such as vomiting blood or substantial weight loss, suggests a non-emergent cause. The fact that the patient did not respond to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy also indicates that the cause of the pain may not be related to acid production. 

Heliobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a common cause of chronic stomach pain. It is a bacterium that infects the stomach lining and can lead to gastritis and peptic ulcers. The urease breath test is a non-invasive diagnostic test used to detect the presence of H. pylori in the stomach. 

Gastric neoplasm (A) is less likely in this patient given the absence of alarm symptoms and the lack of family history of gastric cancer. Gastroesophageal sphincter dysfunction (B) would typically present with symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, rather than chronic stomach pain. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (C) can cause stomach pain, but the patient did not report taking any medications. Excessive gastrin (E) would typically present with symptoms such as peptic ulcers and diarrhea, rather than chronic stomach pain.",
"A 32-year-old G1P1 patient presents to her obstetrician after having a positive pregnancy test at home. She reports that she and her husband had been trying to have a child for the past three months. She has no history of sexually transmitted disease, intravenous drug use, or blood transfusions, and she has never traveled outside of the United States. She was up-to-date on all immunizations before her pregnancy. Ultrasound is consistent with an 8-week gestational sac. The patient requests as few tests as possible, although she does not want to compromise the health of her fetus. Which of the following screening tests should be performed on all pregnant women?
Options:
(A): HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B
(B): HIV, syphilis, and N. gonorrhea
(C): HIV, syphilis, N. gonorrhea and C. trachomatis
(D): HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C
(E): HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B, N. gonorrhea, and C. trachomatis
","HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B",Correct,"The correct choice is (A) HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.

Explanation:
Routine prenatal care includes screening tests for HIV infection, hepatitis B, and syphilis. These tests are important to identify and treat any infections that could potentially harm the fetus or newborn. HIV screening is crucial to prevent transmission of the virus from mother to child. Syphilis screening is important to prevent congenital syphilis, which can cause fetal death, congenital malformations, and severe disability. Hepatitis B screening is necessary to identify pregnant women who are carriers of the virus and to prevent transmission to the newborn. 

The other options (B, C, D, and E) include additional tests such as N. gonorrhea, C. trachomatis, and hepatitis C. While these tests may be important in certain high-risk populations, they are not routinely recommended for all pregnant women. Performing unnecessary tests can increase healthcare costs and may cause unnecessary anxiety for the patient. Therefore, the most appropriate screening tests for all pregnant women are HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.",
"A 29-year-old man is referred by his marriage counselor to the outpatient psychiatry clinic. The patient’s wife is with him and states that her husband is always complaining and critical of others. He was recently fired from his job to which he claims that his boss was jealous of his hard work. He also does not trust his neighbors and thinks they are out to get all the nice things he has. His wife also says that he has begun to doubt her fidelity and believes that even the marriage counselor is on her side. Which of the following psychiatric disorders also belongs to the same cluster of symptoms?
Options:
(A): Schizotypal personality disorder
(B): Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
(C): Antisocial personality disorder
(D): Narcissistic personality disorder
(E): Personality disorder not otherwise specified
",Schizotypal personality disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Schizotypal personality disorder.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario exhibits symptoms that are characteristic of Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is a Cluster A personality disorder, which is characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, as well as social and interpersonal deficits. 

The patient's belief that others are out to harm or deceive him, his unjustified doubts about the loyalty or trustworthiness of others, and his tendency to read hidden demeaning or threatening meanings into benign remarks or events are all consistent with the diagnostic criteria for Schizotypal personality disorder. 

Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (B) is characterized by a preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, and does not involve the same suspiciousness or paranoia seen in the patient in the scenario. 

Antisocial personality disorder (C) is characterized by a disregard for the rights of others and a lack of empathy, and does not involve the same suspiciousness or paranoia seen in the patient in the scenario. 

Narcissistic personality disorder (D) is characterized by a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for admiration, and a lack of empathy, and does not involve the same suspiciousness or paranoia seen in the patient in the scenario. 

Personality disorder not otherwise specified (E) is a category used when a person's symptoms do not meet the criteria for a specific personality disorder, and does not provide a specific diagnosis for the patient in the scenario.",
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by the police. He was found unconscious and covered in bruises outside of a local bar. The patient has a past medical history of polysubstance abuse, depression, multiple suicide attempts, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia. As part of the patient’s initial workup, a head CT is performed which is unremarkable, and an arterial blood gas is performed as seen below:

pH: 7.29
PaCO2: 95 mm Hg
PaO2: 70 mm Hg
Bicarbonate: 24 mEq/L

Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s current presentation?
Options:
(A): Alcohol
(B): Amitriptyline
(C): Cocaine
(D): Ethylene glycol
(E): Heroin
",Heroin,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Heroin.

Explanation:
The arterial blood gas (ABG) results show a low pH (7.29) and an elevated PaCO2 (95 mm Hg), indicating respiratory acidosis. Respiratory acidosis occurs when there is inadequate ventilation, leading to an accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood. This can be caused by respiratory depression, which is a common effect of opioids such as heroin.

In this case, the patient's history of polysubstance abuse, along with the presentation of being found unconscious and covered in bruises, is highly suggestive of opioid overdose. Heroin is a commonly abused opioid that can cause respiratory depression, leading to respiratory acidosis. The patient's past medical history of depression, multiple suicide attempts, and schizophrenia may also contribute to the increased risk of substance abuse.

Alcohol (A) can also cause respiratory depression and acidosis, but the presentation of being found unconscious and covered in bruises is more consistent with opioid overdose rather than alcohol intoxication.

Amitriptyline (B) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can cause anticholinergic effects, such as dry mouth, blurred vision, and urinary retention. It is not typically associated with respiratory depression or acidosis.

Cocaine (C) is a stimulant drug that can cause sympathetic stimulation and respiratory alkalosis, rather than respiratory depression and acidosis.

Ethylene glycol (D) is a toxic substance found in antifreeze and can cause metabolic acidosis, but it does not typically present with respiratory depression or acidosis.",
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents for an acute arm injury. The mother reports that they were walking in the park and the patient’s dad was swinging the patient in the air by her arms. The dad reports he then heard a click and the patient immediately began to cry. On examination, the patient is holding her right forearm in a pronated position and her elbow slightly flexed. Pain is localized to the lateral aspect of the elbow. She refuses to use the affected limb. She does allow passive flexion and extension with full range of motion but supination is limited and causes pain. Which of the following is the next step in management?
Options:
(A): Immobilization
(B): Moderate flexion then hyperpronation
(C): Open reduction
(D): Radiograph
(E): Supination then maximal extension
",Moderate flexion then hyperpronation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Moderate flexion then hyperpronation.

Explanation:
Based on the history and examination findings, the patient most likely has a radial head subluxation, also known as ""pulled elbow."" This injury commonly occurs in young children when there is a sudden pull on the arm, as described in the history. The patient's refusal to use the affected limb and limited supination with pain further support this diagnosis.

The next step in management is reduction of the radial head subluxation. The recommended technique for reduction is moderate flexion followed by hyperpronation. This technique involves holding the patient's elbow at 90° and then firmly pronating the wrist while extending the elbow. A click may be felt or heard when the displacement is reduced.

Immobilization (option A) is not necessary for this injury and may delay the reduction process. Open reduction (option C) is not indicated as this injury can typically be reduced without the need for surgery. Radiographs (option D) are not necessary if the history and examination findings are strongly suggestive of radial head subluxation. Supination then maximal extension (option E) is not the recommended technique for reduction.

Therefore, the next step in management for this patient is moderate flexion then hyperpronation (option B).",
"A 40-year-old male presents to your office complaining that he is too weak to climb stairs or brush his hair. He denies any headaches or change in vision. A muscle biopsy reveals CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Systemic lupus erythematosus
(B): Scleroderma
(C): Polymyalgia rheumatica
(D): Polymyositis
(E): Dermatomyositis
",Polymyositis,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Polymyositis.

Explanation:
Polymyositis is an autoimmune inflammatory myopathy characterized by proximal muscle weakness. It commonly affects adults between the ages of 30 and 60. The weakness is typically symmetric and involves the proximal muscles of the limbs, making it difficult to climb stairs or perform activities that require upper body strength, such as brushing hair. 

A muscle biopsy revealing CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium is a characteristic finding in polymyositis. This infiltration of lymphocytes leads to muscle fiber damage and inflammation. 

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the muscles. However, SLE typically presents with a wide range of symptoms, including joint pain, skin rash, and kidney involvement. The absence of these symptoms makes SLE less likely in this case.

Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis and thickening of the skin and internal organs. It can cause muscle weakness, but it is not typically associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium.

Polymyalgia rheumatica is a condition characterized by pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips. It is more common in older adults and is not associated with CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium.

Dermatomyositis is another autoimmune inflammatory myopathy that shares some similarities with polymyositis. However, dermatomyositis is characterized by characteristic skin findings, such as a purplish papular rash over the dorsum of the hands, which is not mentioned in this case. Additionally, the muscle biopsy findings in dermatomyositis typically show perifascicular atrophy and perivascular inflammation, rather than CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration in the endomysium.",
"A 6-month-old boy presents to his pediatrician for a wellness examination. The mother reports that her child has difficulty rolling from his back to his front and sitting unsupported. The patient is able to smile and furrow his brow normally, but she has noticed that he has a weak cry and suck. He was born at 38 weeks gestation via a spontaneous vaginal delivery without any complications. The mother said that the patient appeared ""normal"" until the past few weeks. On physical exam, his extraocular muscle movements are intact, and a symmetric smile is seen. He has symmetric flaccid weakness of both his upper and lower extremities. He also has a bell-shaped chest. Deep tendon reflexes are diminished. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Anterior horn cell degeneration
(B): Axonal demyelination
(C): Decreased acetylcholine receptor density
(D): Impaired acetylcholine release
(E): Myonecrosis
",Anterior horn cell degeneration,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Anterior horn cell degeneration.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including difficulty rolling, sitting unsupported, weak cry and suck, symmetric flaccid weakness of both upper and lower extremities, and diminished deep tendon reflexes, are consistent with anterior horn cell degeneration. Anterior horn cells are located in the spinal cord and are responsible for transmitting signals from the brain to the muscles. Degeneration of these cells leads to weakness and loss of muscle function. The presence of a bell-shaped chest suggests involvement of the respiratory muscles, which can lead to respiratory compromise. This constellation of symptoms is characteristic of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of anterior horn cells. SMA is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood and can range in severity from mild to severe. In severe cases, it can be life-threatening due to respiratory muscle involvement. Axonal demyelination, decreased acetylcholine receptor density, impaired acetylcholine release, and myonecrosis are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings.",
"A 6-day-old male newborn is brought to the physician because he has become increasingly irritable and restless over the past 2 days. During this period, he has had 12 bowel movements. He feeds 10 to 12 times a day. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation and weighed 1800 g (3 lb 15 oz); he currently weighs 1700 g (3 lb 12 oz). His mother has Graves' disease and received propylthiouracil during the last trimester of pregnancy. She has a history of intravenous heroin use. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 180/min, and respirations are 50/min. Examination shows mild diaphoresis and a firm 2-cm midline neck swelling. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Methimazole and propranolol therapy
(B): Digoxin and furesomide therapy
(C): Potassium iodide therapy
(D): Naloxone therapy
(E): Calcium gluconate therapy
",Methimazole and propranolol therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Methimazole and propranolol therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and history, the newborn is most likely experiencing neonatal Graves' disease, which is caused by transplacental transfer of maternal thyroid-stimulating antibodies. The symptoms of irritability, restlessness, increased bowel movements, and feeding difficulties are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The firm midline neck swelling is indicative of a goiter.

The most appropriate next step in management is to initiate treatment for neonatal Graves' disease. The recommended treatment consists of a combination of the antithyroid drug methimazole and a beta-adrenergic blocker such as propranolol. Methimazole inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones, while propranolol helps control the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia and irritability.

Digoxin and furosemide therapy (B) would be appropriate for the treatment of congestive heart failure, which is not the primary concern in this case.

Potassium iodide therapy (C) is an alternative treatment option for neonatal Graves' disease, but it is generally used when methimazole and beta-adrenergic blockers are not effective or contraindicated. It is not the most appropriate initial step in management.

Naloxone therapy (D) is used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose and is not indicated in this case.

Calcium gluconate therapy (E) is used to treat hypocalcemia and is not indicated in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this newborn with neonatal Graves' disease is to initiate methimazole and propranolol therapy.",
"A previously healthy 29-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of burning with urination for several days. He has also had pain in the right ankle for 3 days and pain and swelling in the left knee for 1 day. Two weeks ago, he had several days of fever and bloody diarrhea, for which he was treated with antibiotics. Examination shows a small left knee effusion and bilateral conjunctival injection. Which of the following is the most likely additional finding in this patient?
Options:
(A): Circular erythematous rash with central clearing
(B): Pain on passive extension of the fingers
(C): Palpable mass in the right lower quadrant
(D): Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon
(E): Nontender subcutaneous nodules over the olecranon
",Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with reactive arthritis, also known as Reiter syndrome. Reactive arthritis is an inflammatory condition that typically occurs following an infection, often involving the gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract. In this case, the patient had a recent episode of fever and bloody diarrhea, which suggests an enteric infection.

Reactive arthritis commonly presents with the classic triad of arthritis, urethritis, and conjunctivitis. The patient in this case has pain and swelling in the left knee, which is consistent with arthritis. The burning with urination suggests urethritis, and the bilateral conjunctival injection confirms conjunctivitis.

In addition to the classic triad, reactive arthritis can also involve other joints and structures. Tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon is a common finding in reactive arthritis. This is known as Achilles tendinitis and is due to inflammation at the insertion of the tendon. The patient's pain in the right ankle for 3 days further supports this finding.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient with reactive arthritis is tenderness at the insertion of the Achilles tendon.",
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a painless lump on her neck for 3 months that has increased in size. She appears healthy. Examination shows a 2.5-cm (1-in) firm, irregular swelling on the left side of the neck that moves with swallowing. There is painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Ultrasound of the neck shows a solitary left lobe thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. A fine needle aspiration biopsy is scheduled for the following week. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid
(B): Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid
(C): Hürthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid
(D): Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid
(E): Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid
",Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings on examination and ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and typically presents as a painless lump in the neck. It is more common in women and tends to occur in younger individuals. The presence of painless cervical lymphadenopathy is also suggestive of papillary carcinoma.

On ultrasound, papillary carcinoma often appears as a solitary thyroid mass with increased vascularity and hyperechogenic punctate regions. These findings are consistent with the description in the question.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy is the next step in the evaluation of a thyroid nodule. It is a minimally invasive procedure that can help confirm the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma by examining the cells obtained from the nodule.

Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid (A), medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (B), Hürthle cell carcinoma of the thyroid (C), and anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid (E) are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings described in the question.",
"A 34-year-old man currently staying at an addiction center presents to the staff psychiatrist with diarrhea and painful muscle cramps. He has been discontinuing heroin over the last month as part of his treatment plan. He is HIV positive, hepatitis B (HBV) positive, and was recently treated for an infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. He reports pain over his abdomen, knees, and shoulder. To comprehensively treat these symptoms, which of the following would be the best therapy?
Options:
(A): Methadone
(B): Naloxone
(C): Alvimopan
(D): Morphine
(E): Loperamide
",Methadone,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Methadone.

Explanation:
The patient in this case is experiencing symptoms of opioid withdrawal, including diarrhea and painful muscle cramps, due to discontinuing heroin. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that is commonly used in the treatment of opioid addiction. It helps to alleviate withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings, allowing the patient to gradually taper off opioids and maintain abstinence.

Naloxone (B) is an opioid receptor antagonist that is used to reverse opioid overdose. It is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.

Alvimopan (C) is a peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist that is used to prevent postoperative ileus in patients undergoing bowel resection. It is not indicated for the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms.

Morphine (D) is a potent opioid analgesic that is not typically used in the treatment of opioid withdrawal symptoms. It may provide temporary relief of pain, but it does not address the underlying withdrawal symptoms.

Loperamide (E) is an over-the-counter antidiarrheal medication that acts on opioid receptors in the gut to decrease motility. While it may provide temporary relief of diarrhea, it does not address the underlying withdrawal symptoms or provide comprehensive treatment for opioid addiction.",
"A 26-year-old man presents to his physician with a history of diarrhea and vomiting for the past 24 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9ºC (98.4ºF), pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 102/74 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. A resident working under the physician plots a Darrow-Yannet diagram for the patient. The diagram is shown in the picture where the green dotted line represents the new fluid status. Which of the following is most likely to show increased secretion in this patient?
Options:
(A): B-type natriuretic peptide
(B): Bradykinin
(C): Erythropoietin
(D): Renin
(E): Vasoactive intestinal peptide
",Renin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Renin.

Explanation:
In this patient with diarrhea and vomiting, the most likely cause of increased secretion is dehydration. Dehydration leads to a decrease in blood volume and a decrease in blood pressure. In response to decreased blood pressure, the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidney release renin. Renin then acts on angiotensinogen to convert it to angiotensin I, which is further converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal glands. Aldosterone acts on the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the kidney to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, leading to water retention and an increase in blood volume. Therefore, in this patient, the increased secretion of renin is the most likely response to the dehydration caused by diarrhea and vomiting.",
"A 28-year-old female comes to the physician’s office with a complaint of episodic chest pain. She describes the pain as squeezing and tightness in her chest. This pain has been happening every few days for 3 months. She says there is no association of the pain with food or exercise. She is able to climb up to her fourth floor apartment daily without issue. Her only past medical history is migraines for which she takes appropriate medication. Here temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/68 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. She has no known family history. The patient is not in pain on presentation and EKG in the office is normal. 24-hour ECG monitoring shows transient ST elevations during the episodes of pain that resolve completely. The mechanism of this patient’s chest pain is most similar to the mechanism behind which of the following?
Options:
(A): Raynaud's phenomenon
(B): Myocardial infarction
(C): Aortic dissection
(D): Costochondritis
(E): Dysphagia
",Raynaud's phenomenon,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B) Myocardial infarction.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of episodic chest pain described as squeezing and tightness, along with transient ST elevations on ECG during the episodes of pain, are consistent with myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction occurs when there is a sudden blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle, leading to ischemia and subsequent damage to the heart tissue. The symptoms of chest pain, particularly when described as squeezing or tightness, are classic for myocardial infarction. The transient ST elevations on ECG during the episodes of pain further support this diagnosis, as ST elevations are a characteristic finding in myocardial infarction. It is important to note that the patient's normal EKG in the office does not rule out the possibility of myocardial infarction, as EKG changes may not always be present during the pain-free period.",
"A 22-year-old gravida 1 presents to her physician at 15 weeks gestation for a prenatal appointment. She complains of a rash involving her chest, face, and arms, a watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She has had these symptoms for about 5 days. The symptoms do not seem to bother her too much, but she is concerned for the baby. She had contact with her younger sister, who also had a rash and was diagnosed with rubella infection about 10 days ago at a family gathering. She cannot confirm her vaccination history. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 110/70 mmHg; heart rate, 89/min; respiratory rate, 12/min; and temperature, 37.6℃ (99.7℉). Examination shows a moderately dense maculopapular lacy rash spread over the patient’s trunk, extremities, and face. No lymph node, liver, or spleen enlargement is noted. The knee joints appear normal.
Serology performed 1 year ago Current serology
Rubella IgM - negative Rubella IgM - negative
Rubella IgG - 1:128 Rubella IgG - 1:64
Rubella IgG avidity - high Rubella IgG avidity - high
What is the proper next step in the management of this woman?
Options:
(A): Reassure and recommend vaccination against rubella postpartum
(B): Recommend pregnancy termination
(C): Arrange a chorionic villus sampling
(D): Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19
(E): Test for rubella virus PCR
",Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19.

The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with rubella infection, as she has a rash, watery nasal discharge, and mild bilateral knee pain. She also had contact with her sister who was diagnosed with rubella infection. However, her current serology shows a negative IgM result and a lower IgG titer compared to her previous serology. This raises the possibility of a false negative IgM result or a recent rubella infection.

In pregnant women with a rubella-like rash, it is important to investigate for both rubella and parvovirus B19, as they can present with similar clinical features. Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can cause fetal complications, including fetal hydrops and anemia. Therefore, it is crucial to rule out parvovirus B19 infection in this patient.

The proper next step in the management of this woman is to recommend additional serologic testing for parvovirus B19. This can be done by testing for parvovirus B19 IgM and IgG antibodies. If the IgM result is positive or there is a significant rise in IgG antibodies, it would confirm a recent parvovirus B19 infection. Further management and monitoring would be based on the results of this testing.

Reassuring and recommending vaccination against rubella postpartum (option A) is not the appropriate next step, as the patient's current symptoms and history suggest a possible recent rubella infection. Pregnancy termination (option B) is not indicated based on the information provided. Chorionic villus sampling (option C) is not necessary at this point, as it is primarily used for prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders and not for the diagnosis of rubella or parvovirus B19 infection. Testing for rubella virus PCR (option E) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Serologic testing for parvovirus B19 is recommended first, as it can help differentiate between rubella and parvovirus B19 infection.",
"A 20-year-old woman presents with vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful micturition for the past 5 days. She is sexually active with multiple partners and admits to using barrier protection inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. The patient denies any fever, chills, abdominal pain, menorrhagia, or flank pain. She is afebrile and the vital signs are within normal limits. Speculum examination reveals vaginal erythema with a profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge. The vaginal pH is 5.5. Vaginal swab and urine samples are obtained for microscopy and culture, and results are pending. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on her presentation?
Options:
(A): Urinary tract infection
(B): Candida vaginitis
(C): Bacterial vaginosis
(D): Trichomonal vaginitis
(E): Chlamydia infection
",Trichomonal vaginitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Trichomonal vaginitis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is trichomonal vaginitis. Trichomonal vaginitis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It is commonly associated with symptoms such as vaginal discharge, pruritus, and painful urination.

The patient's history of multiple sexual partners and inconsistent barrier protection increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection. The profuse, greenish-yellow, purulent, malodorous discharge is characteristic of trichomonal vaginitis. The vaginal pH of 5.5 is also consistent with this diagnosis, as trichomonal vaginitis typically results in an elevated vaginal pH (>4.5).

Urinary tract infection (option A) typically presents with symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, urgency, and suprapubic pain. The absence of these symptoms, as well as the presence of a malodorous discharge, makes urinary tract infection less likely.

Candida vaginitis (option B) is characterized by a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge and vaginal itching. The absence of these findings, as well as the presence of a greenish-yellow discharge, makes candida vaginitis less likely.

Bacterial vaginosis (option C) is characterized by a thin, grayish-white discharge with a fishy odor. The presence of a greenish-yellow discharge and the absence of a fishy odor make bacterial vaginosis less likely.

Chlamydia infection (option E) can cause vaginal discharge, but it is often asymptomatic in women. Additionally, chlamydia infection is not typically associated with a greenish-yellow discharge. Therefore, chlamydia infection is less likely in this patient.",
"A 47-year-old female undergoes a thyroidectomy for treatment of Graves' disease. Post-operatively, she reports a hoarse voice and difficulty speaking. You suspect that this is likely a complication of her recent surgery. What is the embryologic origin of the damaged nerve that is most likely causing this patient's hoarseness?
Options:
(A): 1st pharyngeal arch
(B): 2nd pharyngeal arch
(C): 3rd pharyngeal arch
(D): 4th pharyngeal arch
(E): 6th pharyngeal arch
",6th pharyngeal arch,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) 6th pharyngeal arch.

Explanation:
The 6th pharyngeal arch is the embryologic origin of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which innervates the muscles of the larynx. During a thyroidectomy, there is a risk of injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which can result in hoarseness and difficulty speaking. This is because the recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies the muscles responsible for vocal cord movement and tension. Damage to this nerve can lead to vocal cord paralysis or weakness, causing hoarseness and difficulty speaking. Therefore, in this patient's case, the hoarseness and difficulty speaking are likely due to damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which has an embryologic origin in the 6th pharyngeal arch.",
"A 15-year-old boy with poorly controlled asthma presents to the emergency room complaining of severe shortness of breath. His mother reports that he had trouble breathing soon after he started playing soccer with some friends and was unable to use his inhaler as it was empty. His family history is notable for emphysema in his paternal uncle and cirrhosis in his maternal grandfather. The child’s temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 28/min, and oxygen saturation is 91% on room air. Physical examination demonstrates wheezing bilaterally in all lung fields. The child is started on supplemental oxygen and a nebulized bronchodilator. Which of the following is a downstream effect of this medication?
Options:
(A): Decreased leukotriene activity
(B): Prevention of mast cell degranulation
(C): Activation of muscarinic receptors
(D): Decreased phosphodiesterase activity
(E): Increased adenylate cyclase activity
",Increased adenylate cyclase activity,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Increased adenylate cyclase activity.

Explanation:
A nebulized bronchodilator is a medication used to treat asthma by relaxing the smooth muscles in the airways, allowing for easier breathing. One of the most commonly used bronchodilators is a beta-agonist, such as albuterol. Beta-agonists work by binding to beta-2 adrenergic receptors on the smooth muscle cells in the airways, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase.

Adenylate cyclase is an enzyme that converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP). Increased levels of cAMP in the smooth muscle cells result in the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which leads to the phosphorylation of various proteins involved in smooth muscle contraction. Phosphorylation of these proteins causes relaxation of the smooth muscles, leading to bronchodilation.

Therefore, the downstream effect of a nebulized bronchodilator is increased adenylate cyclase activity, resulting in increased levels of cAMP and subsequent smooth muscle relaxation in the airways. This helps to relieve the bronchospasm and improve airflow in patients with asthma.",
"A 55-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of an increasing sensation of fullness in the upper left side of his abdomen. He complains of increasing fatigue and dyspnea. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 90/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg. His conjunctivae are pale. The examination of the heart and lungs shows no abnormalities. The splenic margin is palpable 8 cm (3.1 in) below the costal margin. No abnormal lymph nodes are found. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 90 μm3
Leukocyte count 3,000/mm3
Platelet count 85,000/mm3
Peripheral blood smear shows small lymphocytes with cell membrane projections. Bone marrow aspiration is unsuccessful. Cell immunophenotyping is positive for CD25. Which of the following is the most effective pharmacotherapy at this time?
Options:
(A): Cladribine
(B): Fludarabine
(C): Imatinib
(D): Prednisone
(E): Thalidomide
",Cladribine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Cladribine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is hairy cell leukemia (HCL). HCL is a rare type of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of small lymphocytes with cell membrane projections on peripheral blood smear. The disease typically presents with splenomegaly, fatigue, and cytopenias (low hemoglobin, leukocyte count, and platelet count).

The most effective pharmacotherapy for HCL is purine analogs, such as cladribine (also known as 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine). Cladribine is a nucleoside analog that is incorporated into the DNA of rapidly dividing cells, leading to DNA chain termination and cell death. It has been shown to induce complete remission in up to 85-95% of patients with HCL.

Fludarabine (B) is another purine analog that is effective in the treatment of HCL, but cladribine is generally preferred due to its higher response rates.

Imatinib (C) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of certain types of leukemia, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL). It is not effective in the treatment of HCL.

Prednisone (D) is a corticosteroid that is commonly used in the treatment of various hematologic malignancies, but it is not the most effective pharmacotherapy for HCL.

Thalidomide (E) is an immunomodulatory drug that is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma and certain types of lymphoma, but it is not the most effective pharmacotherapy for HCL.",
"A 57-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. His symptoms started a few days ago and have been gradually worsening. Initially, the patient had a fever and a cough which has progressed to abdominal pain, diarrhea, and confusion. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for localized crackles and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. The patient is confused and is answering questions inappropriately. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 16,500/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 190,000/mm^3

HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient?
Options:
(A): Blood cultures
(B): Chest radiography
(C): Lung biopsy
(D): Sputum culture
(E): Urine antigen test
",Urine antigen test,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Urine antigen test.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is pneumonia. The patient presents with fever, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, confusion, crackles, and decreased breath sounds in the left lower lung field. These findings are consistent with a lower respiratory tract infection.

The best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient is the urine antigen test. The urine antigen test is a rapid and non-invasive test that detects the presence of antigens from specific pathogens in the urine. In this case, the most likely pathogen causing the pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is the most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The urine antigen test for Streptococcus pneumoniae has a high sensitivity and specificity and can provide a rapid diagnosis, allowing for appropriate antibiotic therapy to be initiated promptly.

Blood cultures (option A) are also important in the evaluation of pneumonia, as they can help identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy. However, blood cultures may take longer to yield results compared to the urine antigen test.

Chest radiography (option B) is a useful diagnostic tool in the evaluation of pneumonia, as it can help confirm the presence of infiltrates in the lungs. However, it does not provide information about the specific pathogen causing the infection.

Lung biopsy (option C) is an invasive procedure that is not typically performed in the initial evaluation of pneumonia. It may be considered in certain cases, such as when the diagnosis is uncertain or when there is concern for an atypical or fungal infection.

Sputum culture (option D) is another diagnostic test that can help identify the causative organism in pneumonia. However, sputum cultures have a lower sensitivity compared to urine antigen tests and may be difficult to obtain in some patients.

In summary, the urine antigen test is the best diagnostic test to guide current therapy in this patient with pneumonia. It provides a rapid and accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate antibiotic therapy to be initiated promptly.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to the physician because of a 1-day history of progressive pain and blurry vision in his right eye. He is struggling to open this eye because of the pain. His left eye is asymptomatic. He wears contact lenses. He has bronchial asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He works as a kindergarten teacher. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 85/min, and blood pressure 135/75 mm Hg. The examination shows a visual acuity in the left eye of 20/25 and the ability to count fingers at 3 feet in the right eye. A photograph of the right eye is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Angle-closure glaucoma
(B): Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis
(C): Herpes simplex keratitis
(D): Herpes zoster keratitis
(E): Pseudomonas keratitis
",Pseudomonas keratitis,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Pseudomonas keratitis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of progressive pain and blurry vision in the right eye, along with the inability to open the eye due to pain, the most likely diagnosis is an infection of the cornea known as keratitis. The fact that the patient wears contact lenses increases the risk of developing keratitis.

Among the given options, Pseudomonas keratitis is the most likely diagnosis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common cause of bacterial keratitis, especially in contact lens wearers. It is known to cause rapid and severe corneal damage, leading to symptoms such as pain, blurry vision, and difficulty opening the eye. The presence of contact lenses increases the risk of Pseudomonas infection due to the potential for bacterial colonization on the lenses.

Angle-closure glaucoma (option A) typically presents with sudden-onset severe eye pain, headache, and blurred vision. It is not associated with contact lens use or corneal infection.

Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (option B) is a viral infection that causes conjunctivitis and is characterized by redness, tearing, and discharge. It does not typically cause severe pain or corneal involvement.

Herpes simplex keratitis (option C) and herpes zoster keratitis (option D) are both viral infections that can cause corneal inflammation and pain. However, they usually present with a history of recurrent episodes and have characteristic findings on examination, such as dendritic ulcers in the case of herpes simplex keratitis. The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are not consistent with either of these viral infections.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Pseudomonas keratitis.",
"A 50-year-old man presents to his physician with chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise over the past 2 months. He describes himself as being “generally healthy” before the cough began. Past medical history includes hypertension. The patient takes clopamide and a multivitamin daily. His parents are both well and living in a senior living facility. He does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, the patient described a hiking trip in and around the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago. At the office, his temperature is 38.6°C (101.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 120/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and a chest CT shows an irregular opacity measuring 3.8 cm x 3.0 cm in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with multinucleated giant cells and spherules with endospores in the surrounding tissues. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 12.9 mg/dL
Leukocyte count 9,300/mm3
Platelet count 167,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 43 mm/hr
Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine Positive
Acid-fast stain Negative
 Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Histoplasmosis
(B): Mycetoma
(C): Blastomycosis
(D): Valley fever
(E): Chromomycosis
",Valley fever,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Valley fever.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Valley fever, also known as coccidioidomycosis. Valley fever is caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis, which is endemic to the southwestern United States, including Arizona. The patient's history of a hiking trip in the desert near Phoenix, Arizona, 4 months ago is a significant clue.

The symptoms of Valley fever can vary widely, but the most common symptoms include chronic cough, malaise, and joint pain. The patient's chronic cough, aching joints in his hips and lower back, and malaise over the past 2 months are consistent with Valley fever.

The physical examination findings and imaging findings also support the diagnosis of Valley fever. The patient has mild fremetus and dullness with percussion on the right side, which suggests consolidation of the lower right lung. The chest X-ray shows a right-sided consolidation of the lower right lung, and the chest CT shows an irregular opacity in the sub-plural region of the right middle lobe, a small right-sided pleural effusion, and mild right-sided hilar adenopathy. These findings are consistent with the pulmonary manifestations of Valley fever.

The laboratory tests also support the diagnosis of Valley fever. The positive Periodic acid-Schiff and silver methenamine stains indicate the presence of fungal elements in the lung tissue. The negative acid-fast stain rules out other fungal infections such as tuberculosis.

In summary, the patient's history, symptoms, physical examination findings, imaging findings, and laboratory tests are all consistent with Valley fever. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Valley fever.",
"A 22-year-old man with sickle cell disease is brought to the emergency room for acute onset facial asymmetry and severe pain. He was in school when his teacher noted a drooping of his left face. His temperature is 99.9°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 122/89 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for facial asymmetry and 4/5 strength in the patient's upper and lower extremity. A CT scan of the head does not demonstrate an intracranial bleed. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Alteplase
(B): Exchange transfusion
(C): Heparin
(D): Hydroxyurea
(E): Warfarin
",Exchange transfusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Exchange transfusion.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a stroke, as evidenced by acute onset facial asymmetry and severe pain. Sickle cell disease is a known risk factor for stroke, and this patient's symptoms are concerning for a cerebrovascular event. The most appropriate treatment for a stroke in a patient with sickle cell disease is exchange transfusion. Exchange transfusion helps to reduce the percentage of sickle hemoglobin (HbS) and increase the percentage of normal hemoglobin (HbA), thereby improving oxygen delivery to tissues and reducing the risk of further sickling and vaso-occlusion. Alteplase (A) is a thrombolytic agent used in the treatment of ischemic stroke, but it is contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease due to the risk of hemorrhage. Heparin (C) and warfarin (E) are anticoagulants and are not indicated in the treatment of acute stroke. Hydroxyurea (D) is a medication used for the long-term management of sickle cell disease to reduce the frequency of vaso-occlusive crises, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for an acute stroke.",
"A 3-month-old girl is brought to the physician because of a productive cough for 5 days. Over the past month, she has had several episodes of watery stools. She is exclusively breastfed every 3–4 hours for 15–20 minutes. She was delivered vaginally at 38 weeks' gestation at home and has not yet been evaluated by a physician. The mother reports that her child is not gaining weight. The mother had no prenatal care. The infant is at the 5th percentile for height and weight. The infant has not received any immunizations. Her temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 155/min, respirations are 45/min, and blood pressure is 88/50 mm Hg. Oral examination shows white plaques covering the tongue and the palate. Rales are heard bilaterally on cardiopulmonary examination. Cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy is present. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes
(B): DNA test for CFTR mutation
(C): Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test
(D): Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes
(E): T-cell receptor excision circle analysis
",Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Polymerase chain reaction for viral genes.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation of the 3-month-old girl, the most likely diagnosis is a viral infection. The presence of a productive cough, watery stools, white plaques on the tongue and palate, rales on cardiopulmonary examination, and lymphadenopathy are all consistent with a viral infection.

To confirm the diagnosis, the most appropriate test would be a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for viral genes. PCR is a sensitive and specific method for detecting the presence of viral DNA or RNA in a patient's sample. It can identify the specific viral pathogen causing the infection.

The other options are not relevant to the clinical presentation of the patient:
(A) Karyotyping of infant's chromosomes is used to diagnose genetic disorders and is not indicated in this case.
(B) DNA test for CFTR mutation is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation.
(C) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test is used to diagnose syphilis, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation.
(E) T-cell receptor excision circle analysis is used to evaluate T-cell function and is not indicated in this case.",
"A 30-year-old primigravid woman at 22 weeks' gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband for lethargy, nausea, and vomiting for 4 days. This morning she became drowsy. She returned from a business trip to Sudan 3 weeks ago. She denies eating any seafood while traveling. Medications include iron supplements and a multivitamin. Her immunizations are up-to-date and she has never received blood products. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. She is oriented to person and place. Examination shows jaundice and mild asterixis. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 22-week gestation. Laboratory studies show:

Anti-nuclear antibody negative
Anti-smooth muscle antibody negative
Anti-CMV antibody negative
Anti-EBV nuclear antigen antibody negative
An ELISA for HIV is negative. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): HBsAg
(B): Anti-HAV IgG
(C): HCV RNA
(D): Anti-HCV IgG
(E): Anti-HEV IgM
",Anti-HEV IgM,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Anti-HEV IgM.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is acute hepatitis. The patient has symptoms of lethargy, nausea, and vomiting, along with jaundice and elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT). The elevated bilirubin and prolonged prothrombin time also suggest liver dysfunction.

Given the patient's recent travel to Sudan, a region known for hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection, and the absence of other potential causes of acute hepatitis (such as hepatitis A, B, C, or HIV), testing for HEV is warranted.

Anti-HEV IgM is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E. IgM antibodies are produced early in the course of infection and are indicative of recent or ongoing infection. Detection of anti-HEV IgM in the patient's serum would support the diagnosis of acute hepatitis E.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) Anti-HEV IgM.",
"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of multiple episodes of nonbilious emesis for 3 days. The vomitus consists of undigested food and he has also had dark brown emesis twice today. He has been having early satiety during this period. He has had progressive severe episodic epigastric pain and dyspepsia for the past week. The pain is partially relieved with food or over-the-counter antacids, but worsens at night and several hours after eating. He has also had a weight gain of 2 kg (4.4 lbs) during this period. His father underwent surgery for colon cancer 3 years ago. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. He drinks two to three beers daily. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 106/min and blood pressure is 108/68 mm Hg. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The abdomen is mildly tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant; there is a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium. A succussion splash is heard with a stethoscope when the patient is rocked back and forth at the hips. Bowel sounds are reduced. Rectal examination is unremarkable. Test of the stool for occult blood is positive. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Na+ 135 mEq/L
K+ 3.3 mEq/L
Cl- 97 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen 46 mg/dL
Glucose 77 mg/dL

Which of the following is the underlying cause of this patient's vomiting?""
Options:
(A): Inflammation and edema
(B): Abnormal gastric rotation
(C): Neoplastic growth
(D): Scarring and fibrosis
(E): Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection
",Inflammation and edema,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Inflammation and edema.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings on examination, the most likely underlying cause of his vomiting is inflammation and edema. The patient presents with multiple episodes of nonbilious emesis, which consists of undigested food. This suggests gastric obstruction or gastroparesis, which can be caused by inflammation and edema in the stomach. The patient also has early satiety, which is a common symptom of gastric outlet obstruction. The presence of a tympanitic mass in the epigastrium and a succussion splash on examination further support the diagnosis of gastric obstruction.

The patient's history of progressive severe episodic epigastric pain and dyspepsia, which is partially relieved with food or over-the-counter antacids, is also consistent with gastric obstruction. The pain worsening at night and several hours after eating is characteristic of pyloric stenosis, which can be caused by inflammation and edema.

The positive test of the stool for occult blood suggests gastrointestinal bleeding, which can be a complication of gastric obstruction. The weight gain of 2 kg (4.4 lbs) during this period may be due to fluid retention caused by the inflammation and edema.

The other options (B) Abnormal gastric rotation, (C) Neoplastic growth, (D) Scarring and fibrosis, and (E) Walled-off pancreatic fluid collection are less likely to be the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and findings based on the information provided.",
"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of worsening shortness of breath for 6 hours. For the past 5 days, he has had intermittent stabbing pain in the middle of his chest that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths. He has also had a runny nose and a dry cough for the past 2 weeks. He has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 34 years. His current medications include atorvastatin, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide. He appears pale and sweaty. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 25/min. Blood pressure is 107/72 mm Hg during expiration and 86/65 mm Hg during inspiration. Examination shows jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
Options:
(A): Dilation of the atria and ventricles
(B): Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity
(C): Occlusion of a coronary artery
(D): Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space
(E): Fibrous thickening of the pericardium
",Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is caused by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial space. Cardiac tamponade occurs when there is enough fluid in the pericardial space to restrict the filling of the heart chambers, leading to decreased cardiac output and subsequent symptoms of heart failure.

The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, chest pain that worsens with lying down or taking deep breaths, and signs of jugular venous distention and pitting edema below the knees are all consistent with cardiac tamponade. The patient's pale and sweaty appearance, along with the elevated temperature, increased pulse rate, and decreased blood pressure during inspiration (pulsus paradoxus), are also characteristic findings of cardiac tamponade.

The patient's medical history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and smoking, as well as the use of medications such as atorvastatin, enalapril, and hydrochlorothiazide, are risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease, including pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade.

Dilation of the atria and ventricles (option A) is not the most likely cause of this patient's findings. While dilation of the heart chambers can occur in conditions such as heart failure, it does not explain the specific symptoms and signs seen in this patient.

Accumulation of fluid in the pleural cavity (option B) is not the most likely cause of this patient's findings. While pleural effusion can cause shortness of breath, it does not explain the chest pain, jugular venous distention, and pitting edema seen in this patient.

Occlusion of a coronary artery (option C) is not the most likely cause of this patient's findings. While coronary artery occlusion can cause chest pain and myocardial infarction, it does not explain the specific symptoms and signs seen in this patient.

Fibrous thickening of the pericardium (option E) is not the most likely cause of this patient's findings. While fibrous thickening of the pericardium can cause constrictive pericarditis, it does not explain the specific symptoms and signs seen in this patient.",
"A 70-year-old obese male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath and cough of sudden onset. The patient states that his symptoms came on while he was sleeping. The patient has a past medical history of type II diabetes and is currently taking lisinopril, metformin, insulin, and fish oil. On physical exam, you note bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). An EKG and chest radiographs are obtained (Figures A and B). The patient is started on BIPAP and medical therapy and his symptoms improve rapidly. Lab values are as follows.

Serum:
Na+: 137 mEq/L
K+: 3.2 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 31 mEq/L

Which of the following is the best explanation of this patient's current presentation?
Options:
(A): Furosemide
(B): Hydrochlorothiazide
(C): Renal tubular acidosis type I
(D): Renal tubular acidosis type II
(E): Renal tubular acidosis type IV
",Hydrochlorothiazide,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Hydrochlorothiazide.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with heart failure exacerbation, as evidenced by the sudden onset of shortness of breath and cough, along with physical exam findings of bipedal edema and jugular venous distention (JVD). The EKG and chest radiographs may show findings consistent with heart failure, such as pulmonary edema or cardiomegaly.

The patient's lab values are within normal limits, except for a low potassium level (K+: 3.2 mEq/L). This low potassium level is likely due to the use of a diuretic, which is commonly prescribed in heart failure to reduce fluid overload. Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic that can cause hypokalemia as a side effect. 

Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's current presentation is the use of hydrochlorothiazide, which has led to fluid loss and hypokalemia, exacerbating his heart failure symptoms.",
"A 23-year-old woman is seen by her primary care physician for fatigue. She says that she has always felt a little short of breath compared to her friends; however, she did not think that it was abnormal until she started trying a new exercise regimen. On physical exam, she is found to have mild conjunctival pallor and a peripheral blood smear is obtained showing echinocytes but no intracellular accumulations. Upon further questioning, she recalls that several relatives have had similar issues with fatigue and pallor in the past. Which of the following is true about the rate limiting enzyme of the biochemical pathway that is affected by this patient's most likely condition?
Options:
(A): It is stimulated by ATP
(B): It is stimulated by citrate
(C): It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity
(D): It is inhibited by fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
(E): It is inhibited by AMP
",It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and conjunctival pallor, along with the presence of echinocytes on peripheral blood smear, are consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis. Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by defects in the proteins involved in the structural integrity of the red blood cell membrane, leading to the formation of spherical-shaped red blood cells (spherocytes). These spherocytes are more prone to hemolysis, resulting in anemia.

The rate-limiting enzyme of the glycolytic pathway, which is affected in hereditary spherocytosis, is pyruvate kinase. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, generating ATP in the process. In hereditary spherocytosis, the activity of pyruvate kinase is inhibited by protein kinase A (PKA) activity.

Protein kinase A is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). PKA phosphorylates and inhibits pyruvate kinase, leading to a decrease in its activity. This inhibition of pyruvate kinase results in a decrease in ATP production, which further impairs the energy metabolism of the red blood cells and contributes to the symptoms of fatigue and shortness of breath seen in hereditary spherocytosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): It is inhibited by protein kinase A activity.",
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because she feels depressed, has difficulty sleeping, a poor appetite, and low concentration for the past 3 months. During this time, she has also had low energy and lost interest in playing the guitar. During high school, the patient went through similar episodes of low mood and poor sleep. At that time, she would repeatedly engage in binge eating and purging behavior, for which she was referred to therapy. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation. The physician offers to prescribe a medication for her current symptoms. Treatment with which of the following drugs should most be avoided in this patient?
Options:
(A): Duloxetine
(B): Trazodone
(C): Bupropion
(D): Mirtazapine
(E): Citalopram
",Bupropion,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Bupropion.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, she is most likely experiencing a major depressive episode. The presence of low mood, poor sleep, poor appetite, low concentration, low energy, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder.

The patient's history of engaging in binge eating and purging behavior during high school suggests a previous diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. It is important to note that individuals with bulimia nervosa have an increased risk of developing major depressive disorder. 

Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a history of bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa due to its potential to lower the seizure threshold. Bupropion is an antidepressant that works by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine. It is commonly used to treat depression, but it is not recommended in patients with a history of eating disorders.

Therefore, in this patient, treatment with bupropion should be avoided. Other options such as duloxetine, trazodone, mirtazapine, and citalopram may be considered as potential treatment options for her depressive symptoms. However, the specific choice of medication should be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's symptoms, medical history, and individual preferences. It is important to involve the patient in the decision-making process and consider any potential side effects or drug interactions.",
"A 5-month-old boy is brought to the physician with a 3-day history of fever and cough. His mother reports that he has had multiple episodes of loose stools over the past 3 months. He has been treated for otitis media 4 times and bronchiolitis 3 times since birth. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation, and the neonatal period was uncomplicated. He is at the 10th percentile for height and 3rd percentile for weight. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F), pulse is 126/min, and respirations are 35/min. Examination shows an erythematous scaly rash over his trunk and extremities. The white patches on the tongue and buccal mucosa bleed when scraped. Inspiratory crackles are heard in the right lung base. An X-ray of the chest shows an infiltrate in the right lower lobe and an absent thymic shadow. Which of the following is the most likely definitive treatment for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Hematopoietic cell transplantation
(B): Interferon-γ therapy
(C): Intravenous immune globulin
(D): Leucovorin supplementation
(E): Thymic transplantation
",Hematopoietic cell transplantation,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by severe impairment of both the cellular and humoral immune systems. Patients with SCID are highly susceptible to severe and recurrent infections, as well as failure to thrive.

The patient's history of multiple episodes of infections, including otitis media and bronchiolitis, along with the presence of an infiltrate in the right lower lobe on chest X-ray, suggests a severe respiratory infection. The absence of a thymic shadow on the X-ray is also consistent with SCID, as the thymus is typically absent or hypoplastic in these patients.

The definitive treatment for SCID is hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), also known as bone marrow transplantation. HCT involves replacing the patient's defective immune system with healthy stem cells from a donor. This procedure can restore immune function and provide long-term protection against infections.

The other options are not appropriate for the treatment of SCID:
- Interferon-γ therapy (B) is not the definitive treatment for SCID. Interferon-γ may be used as adjunctive therapy in some cases, but it is not curative.
- Intravenous immune globulin (C) may be used to provide temporary immune support in patients with SCID, but it is not a definitive treatment.
- Leucovorin supplementation (D) is used in the treatment of certain metabolic disorders, but it is not indicated for SCID.
- Thymic transplantation (E) is a potential treatment option for patients with complete DiGeorge syndrome, but it is not the definitive treatment for SCID.",
"Six days after undergoing an aortic valve replacement surgery, a 68-year-old woman has bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters and severe right leg pain. She has a history of hypertension and major depressive disorder. She drinks 3 beers daily. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, prophylactic unfractionated heparin, and fluoxetine. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/92 mm Hg. Examination shows multiple hematomas on the upper extremities around the peripheral intravenous access sites. There is a healing sternal incision. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows an aortic click. The right calf is tender, erythematous and swollen. Laboratory studies show:

Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Deficiency of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
(B): Phagocytosis of autoantibody-opsonized platelets
(C): Deficiency of von Willebrand factor
(D): Excess circulating thrombin
(E): Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation
",Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Autoantibody-mediated platelet activation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction. The patient has bluish discolorations around the peripheral intravenous catheters, which are likely due to bleeding into the skin (purpura) as a result of low platelet count. The severe right leg pain and swelling are consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can occur in patients with ITP due to platelet activation and formation of blood clots. The laboratory findings of low platelet count (48,000/mm3) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) suggest a platelet dysfunction rather than a deficiency of clotting factors. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension, major depressive disorder, and alcohol use are not associated with vitamin K deficiency or von Willebrand factor deficiency. Excess circulating thrombin is not the underlying mechanism in this case, as the patient's prothrombin time (PT) is within the normal range. Therefore, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's symptoms is autoantibody-mediated platelet activation.",
"A 55-year-old man with chronic hepatitis B virus infection comes to the physician because of generalized fatigue and a 5.4 kg (12 lb) weight loss over the past 4 months. Physical examination shows hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show an α-fetoprotein concentration of 380 ng/ml (N < 10 ng/mL). A CT scan of the abdomen with contrast shows a solitary mass in the left lobe of the liver that enhances in the arterial phase. Which of the following is the most likely underlying pathogenesis of this patient's current condition?
Options:
(A): Overexpression of secretory hepatitis antigen
(B): Intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein
(C): Gain of function mutation of a proto-oncogene
(D): Viral cytotoxin-induced cellular dysplasia
(E): Integration of foreign DNA into host genome
""
","Integration of foreign DNA into host genome
""",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Integration of foreign DNA into host genome.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario has chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which is known to be associated with an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The presence of a solitary mass in the liver, hepatomegaly, and elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP) levels are all consistent with the diagnosis of HCC.

Integration of foreign DNA into the host genome is a key step in the development of HCC in patients with chronic HBV infection. HBV is a DNA virus that can integrate its DNA into the host genome, leading to dysregulation of cellular growth and proliferation. This integration can result in the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes, promoting the development of HCC.

Overexpression of secretory hepatitis antigen (choice A) is not the underlying pathogenesis of HCC in chronic HBV infection. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded protein (choice B) is not a characteristic feature of HCC. Gain of function mutation of a proto-oncogene (choice C) is not specific to HBV-related HCC. Viral cytotoxin-induced cellular dysplasia (choice D) is not the primary mechanism underlying the development of HCC in chronic HBV infection.",
"A 28-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care physician with increased menstrual bleeding over the past three months. She also notes easy bruising and bleeding from her gums when brushing her teeth. She is sexually active with multiple partners and has no history of intravenous drug use. Physical exam is remarkable for petechiae and scattered ecchymoses on the patient's bilateral upper and lower extremities. Urine beta-HCG is negative. Laboratory results are as follows: Hgb 13.0 g/dL, WBCs 6,000/mL, platelets 95,000/mL, PT 13.2s, aPTT 30s. Peripheral blood smear shows normocytic, normochromic red blood cells and few platelets with no morphologic abnormalities. Which diagnostic study should be performed next?
Options:
(A): Serum factor VIII levels and von Willebrand factor activity
(B): Vitamin B12 and folate levels
(C): Measurement of ADAMTS13 activity
(D): HIV and HCV testing
(E): Bone marrow aspiration
",HIV and HCV testing,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): HIV and HCV testing.

The patient in this case presents with increased menstrual bleeding, easy bruising, and bleeding from the gums, along with laboratory findings of thrombocytopenia (platelet count of 95,000/mL) and prolonged aPTT. These findings suggest a bleeding disorder, and the next step in the evaluation should be to test for HIV and HCV.

HIV and HCV infections can cause thrombocytopenia and bleeding disorders. HIV infection can lead to immune thrombocytopenia, which is characterized by platelet destruction due to autoantibodies. HCV infection can cause thrombocytopenia through various mechanisms, including direct viral effects on platelets and bone marrow suppression.

Given the patient's history of multiple sexual partners, HIV and HCV testing is warranted to evaluate for these infections as potential causes of her bleeding disorder. This is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup.",
"A 6-year-old boy is brought in by his parents to a pediatrician’s office for persistent fever. His temperature has ranged from 38.6°C–39.5°C (101.5°F–103.1°F) over the past week. He was diagnosed with a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. At the present time, he is struggling with a cough with thick purulent sputum. A sputum sample is sent for culture and the patient is started on vancomycin.The pediatrician tells the patient’s family that there is a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree which increases the patient's chances of future infections. He will have to undergo chest physiotherapy and they should report any signs of infection immediately to a medical professional. Which of the following pathogens will most likely infect this patient in adulthood?
Options:
(A): Staphylococcus
(B): Pseudomonas
(C): Burkholderia
(D): Influenza
(E): Candida
",Pseudomonas,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Pseudomonas.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario has a gene defect on chromosome 7, which has caused dysfunction in a transmembrane protein. This defect has resulted in several hospitalizations for various respiratory infections. The presence of thick purulent sputum indicates a collection of mucus in the respiratory tree, which increases the patient's chances of future infections.

Pseudomonas is a common pathogen that infects individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), which is a genetic disorder that affects the transmembrane protein CFTR. CFTR dysfunction leads to the production of thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory tract, making it difficult to clear and increasing the risk of respiratory infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a particularly common and problematic pathogen in CF patients, as it can form biofilms and is resistant to many antibiotics.

Staphylococcus, Burkholderia, Influenza, and Candida are also potential pathogens that can infect individuals with respiratory infections, but Pseudomonas is the most likely pathogen to infect this patient in adulthood due to the presence of thick purulent sputum and the history of respiratory infections associated with the gene defect.",
"An 8-week-old male presents with his mother to the pediatrician for a well visit. The patient has been breastfed since birth, and usually feeds for 30 minutes every 2-3 hours. The patient’s mother is concerned that her milk production is not keeping up with the patient’s nutritional requirements. She reports that about two weeks ago the patient began regurgitating breastmilk through his nose and mouth after some feeds. She reports that he seems mildly upset during the episodes of regurgitation but usually settles down quickly and is hungry again soon afterwards. The patient’s mother has already tried limiting the volume of each feed, which seems to have reduced the frequency of the regurgitation. She denies any diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. Her older son had a similar problem with vomiting that resolved around 12 months of age. Four weeks ago, the patient’s height and weight were in the 40th and 34th percentiles, respectively. His height and weight are now respectively in the 37th and 36th percentiles. On physical exam, the patient is cooing in his mother’s lap and smiles reciprocally with her. He lifts his head and shoulders off the examination table when placed in the supine position. His abdomen is soft, non-tender and non-distended. Bowel sounds are normoactive.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Initiate proton pump inhibitor
(B): Obtain abdominal ultrasound
(C): Reassurance and counseling on positioning
(D): Recommend modification of mother’s diet
(E): Switch to hydrolyzed formula
",Reassurance and counseling on positioning,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Reassurance and counseling on positioning.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is an 8-week-old male who is breastfed and experiencing regurgitation of breastmilk after feeds. The regurgitation is not associated with any other concerning symptoms such as diarrhea, hematochezia, or family history of food allergies. The patient's growth parameters have also remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease in height and weight percentiles. On physical exam, the patient appears well and is interactive.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and counseling on positioning. Regurgitation of small amounts of milk or formula is common in neonates and infants due to reduced lower esophageal sphincter pressure and relatively increased intragastric pressure. As long as the infant is gaining weight and there are no other concerning symptoms, parents can be reassured that regurgitation is of no clinical significance and will decrease as the infant grows.

Counseling on positioning can also be helpful in reducing reflux. Infants with reflux should be fed in an upright or semi-upright position and then maintained in an upright, nonsitting position for 20 to 30 minutes after eating. This helps to decrease pressure in the stomach and minimize reflux.

Initiating a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is not indicated in this case. PPIs are typically reserved for infants with more severe symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or those who fail conservative measures. The patient's symptoms are mild and not affecting his growth or overall well-being.

Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound is not necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms are consistent with uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux and there are no concerning findings on physical exam to suggest an underlying anatomical abnormality.

There is no indication to recommend a modification of the mother's diet or switching to a hydrolyzed formula in this case. The patient's symptoms are likely due to normal reflux and not related to a food allergy or intolerance. These interventions are typically considered if there is suspicion of a cow's milk protein allergy or intolerance, which is not present in this case.

Therefore, the best next step in management is reassurance and counseling on positioning.",
"A 27-year-old gentleman is brought into the ED after being stabbed in the back by a knife. In addition to the pain from the wound, he complains of weakness in his left leg. Upon physical examination you find that he has no other visible injuries; however, he has 2/5 strength in the left lower extremity. Complete neurologic exam also finds a deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity as well as a loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity. Which of the following lesions would result in the syndrome described?
Options:
(A): Anterior cord lesion
(B): Posterior cord lesion
(C): Right cord hemisection
(D): Left cord hemisection
(E): Complete cord transection
",Left cord hemisection,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Left cord hemisection.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a left cord hemisection. A cord hemisection refers to a partial injury to one side of the spinal cord. In this case, the left side of the spinal cord is affected.

The weakness in the left leg (2/5 strength) suggests damage to the corticospinal tract, which is responsible for voluntary motor control. The deficit in vibration sense and light touch on the left lower extremity indicates damage to the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, which is responsible for proprioception and discriminative touch.

The loss of pain and temperature sensation in the right lower extremity suggests damage to the spinothalamic tract, which carries these sensory modalities. The crossing of the spinothalamic tract occurs at the level of the spinal cord, so damage to the left side of the spinal cord would result in loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral (right) side.

Therefore, the syndrome described is consistent with a left cord hemisection.",
"A 58-year-old African American man presents for his yearly wellness visit. He says he has been unsuccessful at losing weight and would like help. His last colonoscopy was 8 years previously, which was normal. Past medical history is significant for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and hypertension. Current medications are isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine and aspirin 81 mg orally daily. He is also on CPAP to manage his OSA. The patient denies any history of smoking or recreational drug use and drinks 1 or 2 beers on weekends. Family history is significant for prostate cancer in his father and hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 in his mother. His vital signs include: temperature 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse 97/min, respiratory rate 16/min, blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. Fasting blood glucose is 90 mg/dL. Which of the following preventative screening tests would be most appropriate for this patient at this time?
Options:
(A): PSA
(B): Digital rectal exam
(C): HbA1C
(D): Abdominal ultrasound
(E): Flexible sigmoidoscopy
",PSA,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) PSA.

Explanation:
Given the patient's age, family history of prostate cancer, and African American ethnicity, the most appropriate preventative screening test for this patient at this time would be a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and African American men have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer compared to other ethnic groups. The American Urological Association recommends that men with a life expectancy of at least 10 years should have a discussion about prostate cancer screening with their healthcare provider. The PSA test is a blood test that measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by the prostate gland. Elevated levels of PSA can indicate the presence of prostate cancer or other prostate conditions. It is important to note that the PSA test is not diagnostic for prostate cancer and can lead to false-positive results, which may require further evaluation with a digital rectal exam and/or prostate biopsy. However, in this case, the PSA test would be the most appropriate initial screening test to assess the patient's risk for prostate cancer. The other options listed (B) digital rectal exam, (C) HbA1C, (D) abdominal ultrasound, and (E) flexible sigmoidoscopy are not indicated based on the patient's history and presentation. A digital rectal exam is a physical examination of the prostate gland and is typically performed in conjunction with a PSA test. HbA1C is a blood test used to assess long-term blood sugar control in patients with diabetes, which is not indicated in this patient. An abdominal ultrasound is not indicated for prostate cancer screening. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is a screening test for colorectal cancer, which is not indicated in this patient who had a normal colonoscopy 8 years ago.",
"A 34-year-old patient is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. An EKG shows sinus tachycardia and chest radiograph reveals an enlarged cardiac silhouette. While observing sinus tachycardia on the patient's telemetry, you note that the radial pulse cannot be palpated during inspiration. What should be the next step in management of this patient?
Options:
(A): IV Heparin
(B): Pericardiocentesis
(C): Chest CT scan
(D): Pericardial window
(E): Insert chest tube
",Pericardiocentesis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Pericardiocentesis.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency. Cardiac tamponade occurs when there is an accumulation of fluid or blood in the pericardial sac, leading to compression of the heart and impaired cardiac function.

The presence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette on the chest radiograph suggests pericardial effusion, which is a common precursor to cardiac tamponade. The inability to palpate the radial pulse during inspiration, known as pulsus paradoxus, is a classic finding in cardiac tamponade.

Pericardiocentesis is the next step in management for this patient. It involves the insertion of a needle or catheter into the pericardial sac to drain the accumulated fluid or blood. This procedure helps relieve the pressure on the heart and improves cardiac function.

IV Heparin (option A) is not indicated in this scenario as it is used for the treatment of conditions such as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, which are not the primary concern in this patient.

A chest CT scan (option C) may provide further information about the extent and cause of the pericardial effusion, but it is not the immediate next step in management.

A pericardial window (option D) is a surgical procedure that creates a permanent communication between the pericardial sac and the pleural space. It is typically reserved for cases of recurrent pericardial effusion or when pericardiocentesis is not feasible.

Inserting a chest tube (option E) is not the appropriate next step in management for this patient. Chest tubes are used to drain air or fluid from the pleural space, not the pericardial sac.",
"A previously healthy 60-year-old man comes to his physician because of progressively worsening shortness of breath for the past 2 months. He does not experience shortness of breath at rest. He also occasionally has a dry cough. He has not had fever, chills, or night sweats. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the past 40 years. He drinks a beer daily and occasionally more on weekends. He does not use illicit drugs. He is 183 cm (6 ft 0 in) tall and weighs 66 kg (145 lbs); BMI is 19.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 136/88 mm Hg. Lung auscultation reveals a prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing. Spirometry shows an FEV1:FVC ratio of 62%, an FEV1 of 60% of predicted, and a total lung capacity of 125% of predicted. The diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is decreased. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Interstitial lung disease
(B): Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
(C): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(D): Bronchiectasis
(E): Bronchial asthma
",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Explanation:
The patient's history of progressively worsening shortness of breath, dry cough, and smoking history of 40 years strongly suggests chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a chronic inflammatory lung disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. It is commonly caused by smoking, which leads to chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and wheezing are consistent with airflow limitation. The prolonged expiratory phase and end-expiratory wheezing on lung auscultation further support the diagnosis of COPD.

Spirometry is a key diagnostic test for COPD. The FEV1:FVC ratio of 62% and FEV1 of 60% of predicted indicate airflow limitation. In COPD, the FEV1:FVC ratio is typically less than 70%. The total lung capacity of 125% of predicted suggests hyperinflation, which is commonly seen in COPD due to air trapping.

The decreased diffusion capacity of the lung (DLCO) is also consistent with COPD. DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gases from the alveoli to the bloodstream. In COPD, the DLCO is often decreased due to destruction of the alveolar-capillary membrane.

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) (choice A) is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the lung interstitium. It typically presents with dyspnea on exertion, dry cough, and fine inspiratory crackles on lung auscultation. The spirometry findings in this patient are not consistent with ILD.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (choice B) is an immune-mediated lung disease caused by repeated inhalation of organic antigens. It presents with dyspnea, cough, and diffuse crackles on lung auscultation. The spirometry findings in this patient are not consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

Bronchiectasis (choice D) is characterized by permanent dilation of the bronchi due to destruction of the bronchial walls. It typically presents with chronic cough, sputum production, and recurrent respiratory infections. The spirometry findings in this patient are not consistent with bronchiectasis.

Bronchial asthma (choice E) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and cough. While the patient's symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath are consistent with asthma, the spirometry findings in this patient are not consistent with asthma. In asthma, the FEV1:FVC ratio is typically normal or increased, and the FEV1 may be variable.",
"A 29-year-old G1P0 woman is giving birth at 38 weeks gestation to a  boy via vaginal delivery. As soon as the infant is clear of the vagina, a congenital malformation of the abdomen is observed. The infant is removed from the delivery room for further evaluation. Visual inspection shows loops of intestine protruding out of his abdomen on the right side. His APGAR scores are 7 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. His heart rate is 125/min, and his respirations are 45/min. All reflexes appear normal. There are no other visible defects. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag
(B): Transfer the newborn to the NICU
(C): Start IV fluids
(D): Place the newborn under a warmer
(E): Transfer the newborn for immediate surgery
",Wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag.

Explanation:
The most appropriate next step in management for this newborn with gastroschisis is to wrap the intestines in a sterile bowel bag. Gastroschisis is a congenital malformation of the abdominal wall where loops of intestine protrude outside of the abdomen. The initial approach to management of these newborns includes wrapping the bowel with sterile saline dressings covered with plastic wrap. This helps to preserve body heat, minimize insensible fluid loss, and protect the bowel. In some centers, the neonate is immediately placed into a plastic bag covering its lower half to maximize temperature control and hydration while allowing access to initial visual examination. This step is crucial in preventing further complications and maintaining the health of the newborn. The other options, such as transferring the newborn to the NICU, starting IV fluids, placing the newborn under a warmer, or transferring the newborn for immediate surgery, may be necessary at some point, but the immediate priority is to protect and preserve the exposed intestines.",
"A 54-year-old woman presents with fatigue, malaise, and shortness of breath over the past 5 months. Past medical history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed 23 years ago for which she takes naproxen as needed. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.9°C (98.4°F), blood pressure 135/88 mm Hg, pulse 92/min. Physical examination is significant for conjunctival pallor and bilateral ulnar deviation of the metacarpophalangeal joints. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 76 fL
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Platelet count 220,000/mm3
Serum ferritin 310 ng/mL
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 85 mm/h
Which of the following is a feature of this patient's anemia?
Options:
(A): ↑ serum transferrin receptors
(B): ↑ transferrin saturation
(C): ↑ methylmalonic acid
(D): Upregulation of hepcidin
(E): ↑ reticulocyte count
",Upregulation of hepcidin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Upregulation of hepcidin.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with anemia of chronic disease (ACD), which is a common cause of anemia in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. ACD is characterized by decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis, leading to a decrease in hemoglobin levels. One of the key features of ACD is upregulation of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron metabolism. Hepcidin acts by inhibiting iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages, leading to decreased iron availability for erythropoiesis. This upregulation of hepcidin is a compensatory mechanism to prevent iron overload in the setting of chronic inflammation. Therefore, the correct answer is (D): Upregulation of hepcidin.",
"A six-year-old boy with a history of asthma currently uses an albuterol inhaler as needed to manage his asthma symptoms. His mother brings him into your office because she feels she has had to increase the patient’s use of his inhaler to four times per week for the past month. She also reports that he has woken up three times during the night from his symptoms this month. The boy reports that he is upset because he can’t always keep up with his friends in the playground. His past medical history is significant for allergic rhinitis. The patient’s temperature is 98°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% O2 on room air. Auscultation of his lungs reveals bilateral late expiratory wheezes.

What changes should be made to his current asthma treatment regimen?
Options:
(A): Maintain current therapy
(B): Add cromolyn prior to exercise
(C): Add fluticasone daily
(D): Add salmeterol twice daily
(E): Add zileuton twice daily
",Add fluticasone daily,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Add fluticasone daily.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, it appears that his asthma is not well controlled. He is experiencing increased use of his albuterol inhaler, nighttime symptoms, and limitations in physical activity. These are indicators that his current therapy is not sufficient.

Fluticasone is an inhaled corticosteroid that is commonly used as a controller medication for asthma. It helps to reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms. Adding fluticasone daily to the patient's treatment regimen would provide him with consistent anti-inflammatory therapy, which can help improve his asthma control and reduce the need for rescue medication (albuterol).

The other options are not the most appropriate choices for this patient:

(A) Maintain current therapy: This is not the best option because the patient's current therapy is not effectively controlling his symptoms.

(B) Add cromolyn prior to exercise: While cromolyn can be used as a preventive medication for exercise-induced asthma, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient who is experiencing symptoms throughout the day and night.

(D) Add salmeterol twice daily: Salmeterol is a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) that is often used in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma control. However, in this case, adding a LABA alone would not address the underlying inflammation and may not provide sufficient control.

(E) Add zileuton twice daily: Zileuton is a leukotriene modifier that can be used as an alternative or adjunct therapy for asthma. However, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient who would benefit from an inhaled corticosteroid as the first-line controller medication.",
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the office complaining of pelvic pain and feeling “off” for the past few weeks. She has not had any changes in diet or lifestyle but reports weight loss despite an increase in appetite. In addition, she has been experiencing chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance. Physical exam of her thyroid is unremarkable but her TSH was found to be 0.21 mIU/L. A complex structure in her right ovary was detected on ultrasound. Her symptoms can be explained by which of the following?
Options:
(A): Meigs syndrome
(B): Jod-Basedow phenomenon
(C): Dermoid cyst
(D): Struma ovarii
(E): Immature teratoma
",Struma ovarii,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Struma ovarii.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including weight loss despite an increase in appetite, chest palpitations, increased frequency of diarrhea, and heat intolerance, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The unremarkable physical exam of the thyroid and low TSH level (0.21 mIU/L) suggest that the source of the excess thyroid hormone production is not the thyroid gland itself. 

Struma ovarii is a rare ovarian tumor that contains thyroid tissue. It is a specialized form of mature teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor. The thyroid tissue within the struma ovarii can produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormone, leading to hyperthyroidism. This can explain the patient's symptoms of weight loss, palpitations, diarrhea, and heat intolerance.

Meigs syndrome is characterized by the triad of a benign ovarian tumor (usually a fibroma), ascites, and pleural effusion. This syndrome does not typically present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Jod-Basedow phenomenon refers to the development of hyperthyroidism in a patient with underlying thyroid autonomy (e.g., toxic multinodular goiter or toxic adenoma) after the administration of iodine. This phenomenon is not applicable to this patient's presentation.

Dermoid cysts are benign ovarian tumors that contain a variety of tissues, including hair, teeth, and sebaceous material. They do not typically produce thyroid hormone or cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Immature teratomas are malignant germ cell tumors that contain tissues from all three germ cell layers. They do not typically produce thyroid hormone or cause symptoms of hyperthyroidism.",
"An otherwise healthy 15-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), the blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg and the pulse is 100/min. Past medical history is noncontributory and he takes no medication. His father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia. On examination, he is very pale and his spleen is enlarged. His hemoglobin is 5 g/dL and platelet count is slightly reduced. His peripheral blood smear is shown in the picture. Over the next 2 weeks, the patient recovers, and his hemoglobin is 11 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the pattern of inheritance of this patient underlying disorder?
Options:
(A): Autosomal recessive
(B): Autosomal dominant
(C): X-linked recessive
(D): X-linked dominant
(E): Multifactorial
",Autosomal dominant,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Autosomal dominant.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient presents with symptoms of extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, pale appearance, and an enlarged spleen. These findings, along with a low hemoglobin level and slightly reduced platelet count, suggest a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.

Hereditary spherocytosis is an inherited disorder characterized by the presence of spherical-shaped red blood cells, which are more prone to destruction by the spleen. The condition is typically inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, meaning that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disease. 

In this case, the patient's father and aunt both suffer from mild anemia, indicating that they also have hereditary spherocytosis. This pattern of inheritance is consistent with an autosomal dominant disorder, as the condition can be passed down from one affected parent to their offspring.

Therefore, the best representation of the pattern of inheritance for this patient's underlying disorder is autosomal dominant (choice B).",
"A 65-year-old male presents to the emergency department from his home complaining of dyspnea. He is alert and oriented. The following arterial blood gas readings are drawn: pH: 7.33 (Normal: 7.35-7.45), pCO2: 70 mmHg (Normal: 35-45 mmHg), HCO3 33 (Normal: 21-26 mEq/L) Which of the following is most likely to have produced this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Panic attack
(B): Mechanical ventilation
(C): Diabetic ketoacidosis
(D): Pulmonary embolus
(E): Chronic obstructive bronchitis
",Chronic obstructive bronchitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Chronic obstructive bronchitis.

Explanation:
The arterial blood gas readings in this patient indicate respiratory acidosis, which is characterized by a low pH and high pCO2. In respiratory acidosis, there is an accumulation of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the blood due to inadequate ventilation. 

Chronic obstructive bronchitis is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This can lead to difficulty in breathing and impaired ventilation. In this patient, the high pCO2 level suggests that there is inadequate elimination of CO2, leading to respiratory acidosis.

Panic attack, mechanical ventilation, diabetic ketoacidosis, and pulmonary embolus are not likely to be the cause of this patient's condition. Panic attack does not typically cause respiratory acidosis. Mechanical ventilation is used to support ventilation and would not result in respiratory acidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a metabolic condition characterized by high blood sugar and ketone production, not respiratory acidosis. Pulmonary embolus is a blockage of the pulmonary arteries and would not directly cause respiratory acidosis.",
"A 23-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating. He also complains of a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months. He is a bodybuilding competitor and has a competition coming up in 1 week. The man reports that his symptoms appeared suddenly, 30 minutes after he took 2 foreign-manufactured fat-burning pills instead of the 1 he usually takes. His blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg, heart rate is 137/min, respiratory rate is 26/min, and temperature is 39.9°C (103.8°F). Physical examination reveals a reddish maculopapular rash over the patient’s trunk, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in his abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component. Ophthalmologic examination shows bilateral cataracts. The patient’s total blood count is as follows:
Erythrocytes 4.4 x 109/mm3
Hb 12 g/dL
Total leukocyte count  3750/mm3
Neutrophils 57%
Lymphocyte 37%
Eosinophil 1%
Monocyte 5%
Basophil 0%
Platelet count 209,000/mm3
Which of the following statements best describes the pathogenesis of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): The patient’s symptoms are caused by an increased concentration of epinephrine released by the adrenal glands in response to the consumed substance.
(B): The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.
(C): The patient has a pyretic reaction due to bacterial contamination of the pills.
(D): The patient’s condition is due to a type 1 hypersensitivity reaction triggered by the drug.
(E): The drug has stimulated the hypothalamic temperature center to produce hyperthermia.
",The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fever, chest discomfort, tachypnea, pain, needle-like sensations in the upper extremities, and profuse sweating, are consistent with the toxic effects of a drug. The fact that the symptoms appeared suddenly after taking the fat-burning pills suggests a direct relationship between the drug and the symptoms.

The physical examination findings, such as the reddish maculopapular rash, diminished lung and heart sounds, tenderness to palpation in the abdomen, and rotational bilateral nystagmus with an alternating gaze-dependent fast component, further support the toxic effects of the drug.

The ophthalmologic examination findings of bilateral cataracts suggest long-term exposure to a toxic substance, which is consistent with the patient's complaint of a gradual decrease in vision over the past 3 months.

The patient's blood count does not provide any specific information about the pathogenesis of his condition.

Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, the most likely mechanism of action of the drug is uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation. Uncoupling agents disrupt the normal flow of electrons in the electron transport chain, leading to a decrease in ATP production and an increase in metabolic rate. This can result in symptoms such as fever, increased heart rate, and increased respiratory rate. The drug-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation can also explain the patient's symptoms of chest discomfort, pain, and needle-like sensations in the upper extremities.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) The drug caused uncoupling of the electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation.",
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and painful swelling of her right knee for 3 weeks. She works as a professional ballet dancer and says, “I'm always trying to be in shape for my upcoming performances.” She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 45 kg (99 lb); BMI is 17 kg/m2. Physical examination shows tenderness and limited range of motion in her right knee. Oral examination shows bleeding and swelling of the gums. There are diffuse petechiae around hair follicles on her abdomen and both thighs. Laboratory studies show a prothrombin time of 12 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 35 seconds, and a bleeding time of 11 minutes. Arthrocentesis of the right knee shows bloody synovial fluid. The patient’s condition is most likely associated with a defect in a reaction that occurs in which of the following cellular structures?
Options:
(A): Lysosomes
(B): Rough endoplasmic reticulum
(C): Nucleus
(D): Extracellular space
(E): Free ribosomes
",Rough endoplasmic reticulum,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The bleeding time is prolonged, indicating a defect in platelet function. The presence of bleeding and swelling of the gums, as well as petechiae, suggests a deficiency in platelet adhesion and aggregation. This is most commonly seen in von Willebrand disease, which is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF). vWF is synthesized in endothelial cells and megakaryocytes and is stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and the α-granules of platelets. The synthesis and processing of vWF occur in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and Golgi apparatus, respectively. Therefore, a defect in the RER, as seen in choice (B), is the most likely cellular structure involved in this patient's condition. Defects in other cellular structures, such as lysosomes (choice A), the nucleus (choice C), the extracellular space (choice D), or free ribosomes (choice E), would not be expected to cause the specific bleeding symptoms and laboratory findings seen in this patient.",
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because she had unprotected intercourse with her boyfriend the previous day. She has had regular menses since menarche at the age of 12. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. She has no history of serious illness but is allergic to certain jewelry and metal alloys. She takes no medications. A urine pregnancy test is negative. She does not wish to become pregnant until she finishes college in six months. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Insert copper-containing intra-uterine device
(B): Administer mifepristone
(C): Administer ulipristal acetate
(D): Administer depot medroxyprogesterone acetate
(E): Administer combined oral contraceptive
",Administer ulipristal acetate,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Administer ulipristal acetate.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the woman had unprotected intercourse and is seeking contraception to prevent pregnancy. Since her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago and she has regular menses, she is likely in the fertile window of her menstrual cycle. 

Ulipristal acetate is a selective progesterone receptor modulator that can be used as emergency contraception. It is effective up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse. It works by delaying or inhibiting ovulation, preventing fertilization. It is more effective than other emergency contraception methods, such as levonorgestrel, especially when taken closer to the time of unprotected intercourse.

Inserting a copper-containing intrauterine device (Option A) is an effective form of long-term contraception, but it is not appropriate as emergency contraception in this scenario. It is typically inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse and can provide ongoing contraception for up to 10 years.

Administering mifepristone (Option B) is used for medical abortion and is not appropriate for emergency contraception.

Administering depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Option D) is a long-acting contraceptive method that is given by injection every 3 months. It is not appropriate for emergency contraception.

Administering combined oral contraceptives (Option E) is another form of long-term contraception and is not appropriate for emergency contraception.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this woman is to administer ulipristal acetate as emergency contraception.",
"A 27-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents for a 3-month follow-up after starting treatment with lithium. She says she has been compliant with her medication but has experienced no improvement. The patient has no other significant past medical history and takes no other medications. She reports no known allergies. The patient is afebrile, and her vital signs are within normal limits. A physical examination is unremarkable. The patient is switched to a different medication. The patient presents 2 weeks later with an acute onset rash on her torso consisting of targetoid lesions with a vesicular center. She says the rash developed 2 days ago which has progressively worsened. She also says that 1 week ago she developed fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills that resolved in 3 days. Which of the following drugs was this patient most likely prescribed?
Options:
(A): Quetiapine
(B): Lamotrigine
(C): Valproate
(D): Olanzapine-fluoxetine combination (OFC)
(E): Paroxetine
",Lamotrigine,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Lamotrigine.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of an acute onset rash with targetoid lesions and a vesicular center, along with systemic symptoms such as fever, lethargy, myalgia, and chills, is consistent with a severe cutaneous adverse reaction known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). This is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction that can be caused by certain medications, including lamotrigine.

Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant medication commonly used in the treatment of bipolar disorder. It is known to be associated with a risk of causing SJS/TEN, particularly during the first few months of treatment. The risk is higher in patients who have a genetic predisposition, such as those with the HLA-B*1502 allele, which is more common in certain ethnic groups.

In this case, the patient had been switched to a different medication after not experiencing improvement with lithium. Two weeks later, she developed the characteristic rash and systemic symptoms of SJS/TEN. This timeline is consistent with the initiation of lamotrigine as the likely cause of her reaction.

It is important to note that SJS/TEN is a medical emergency and requires immediate discontinuation of the offending medication. The patient should be referred to a dermatologist or an emergency department for further evaluation and management.",
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 6-month history of mild episodic abdominal pain. The episodes occur every 1–2 months and last for a few hours. The pain is located in the epigastrium, radiates to his back, and is occasionally associated with mild nausea. His mother is concerned that his condition might be hereditary because his older sister was diagnosed with congenital heart disease. He is otherwise healthy and has met all developmental milestones. He is at the 75th percentile for height and the 65th percentile for weight. Physical examination shows no abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Which of the following congenital conditions would best explain this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
(B): Biliary cyst
(C): Tracheoesophageal fistula
(D): Intestinal malrotation
(E): Pancreas divisum
",Pancreas divisum,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Pancreas divisum.

Explanation:
Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly where the pancreatic ducts fail to fuse during embryonic development. This results in the majority of the pancreatic secretions draining through the smaller accessory duct instead of the larger main pancreatic duct. 

The patient's symptoms of mild episodic abdominal pain, located in the epigastrium and radiating to the back, are consistent with pancreatitis. Pancreas divisum can lead to recurrent episodes of pancreatitis due to impaired drainage of pancreatic secretions. The pain is typically mild and self-limited, lasting for a few hours. 

The absence of abdominal distention, guarding, or rebound tenderness on physical examination suggests that there is no acute abdominal pathology, such as an obstruction or inflammation. 

The patient's height and weight percentiles are within the normal range, which suggests that there are no significant growth or developmental abnormalities associated with the condition. 

The patient's family history of congenital heart disease is not directly related to the symptoms described and is unlikely to be associated with pancreas divisum.",
"A healthy, full-term 1-day-old female is being evaluated after birth and is noted to have a cleft palate and a systolic ejection murmur at the second left intercostal space. A chest radiograph is obtained which reveals a boot-shaped heart and absence of a thymus. An echocardiogram is done which shows pulmonary stenosis with a hypertrophic right ventricular wall, ventricular septal defect, and overriding of the aorta. Which of the following additional features is expected to be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Seizures due to hypocalcemia
(B): Catlike cry
(C): Hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies
(D): Webbing of the neck
(E): Increased phenylalanine in the blood
",Seizures due to hypocalcemia,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B) Catlike cry.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation described in the question stem is consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot, which is a congenital heart defect characterized by four anatomical abnormalities: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. In addition to these cardiac abnormalities, patients with Tetralogy of Fallot may also have other associated features.

One of the associated features commonly seen in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot is a catlike cry. This high-pitched cry is thought to be due to abnormal development of the larynx and is often described as sounding like a ""mewing"" or ""catlike"" cry. It is important to note that this cry is not specific to Tetralogy of Fallot and can also be seen in other genetic disorders, such as cri-du-chat syndrome.

Seizures due to hypocalcemia (choice A) are not typically associated with Tetralogy of Fallot. Hypocalcemia can occur in newborns for various reasons, but it is not a characteristic feature of this specific congenital heart defect.

Hyperthyroidism from transplacental antibodies (choice C) is not associated with Tetralogy of Fallot. Hyperthyroidism in newborns can occur due to transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies, but it is not a feature of this particular cardiac anomaly.

Webbing of the neck (choice D) is seen in Turner syndrome, which is a genetic disorder characterized by complete or partial monosomy of the X chromosome. It is not a feature of Tetralogy of Fallot.

Increased phenylalanine in the blood (choice E) is seen in phenylketonuria (PKU), which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is not associated with Tetralogy of Fallot.",
"A 58-year-old male with a history of obesity and hypertension presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He currently takes hydrochlorothiazide. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 135/80 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 17/min. His BMI is 31 kg/m2. Results of a lipid panel are: Total cholesterol is 280 mg/dl, triglycerides are 110 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol is 40 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol is 195 mg/dl. Her physician considers starting her on atorvastatin. Which of the following will most likely decrease after initiating this medication?
Options:
(A): Mevalonate
(B): Acetoacetyl-CoA
(C): HMG-CoA
(D): Diacyglycerol
(E): High-density lipoprotein
",Mevalonate,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Mevalonate.

Explanation:
Atorvastatin is a statin medication that works by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is responsible for the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. By inhibiting this enzyme, atorvastatin reduces the production of mevalonate, which is a precursor for cholesterol synthesis.

Therefore, after initiating atorvastatin, the levels of mevalonate will most likely decrease. This decrease in mevalonate will subsequently lead to a decrease in cholesterol synthesis, resulting in lower levels of LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) in the blood.",
"A 54-year-old man presents with the acute onset of seizures and hallucinations. The patient’s wife says that he had been on a camping trip a few months earlier to study bats but otherwise has not traveled recently. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, managed medically with hydralazine and enalapril. The patient’s condition rapidly deteriorates, and he passes away. An autopsy is performed and a histologic stained section of the brain is shown in the image. Which of the following receptors are targeted by the pathogen most likely responsible for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): CCR5
(B): CD21
(C): Acetylcholine receptor
(D): ICAM-1
(E): GABA
",Acetylcholine receptor,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Acetylcholine receptor.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of acute onset seizures and hallucinations, along with the history of a camping trip to study bats, the most likely pathogen responsible for this patient's condition is the rabies virus. Rabies is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system and is transmitted through the bite or scratch of an infected animal, such as bats.

The histologic stained section of the brain shown in the image is consistent with rabies infection. Rabies virus targets and binds to acetylcholine receptors in the central nervous system, leading to the neurological symptoms seen in this patient.

CCR5 (A) is a chemokine receptor involved in immune responses and is not directly targeted by the rabies virus.

CD21 (B) is a receptor found on B cells and is not directly targeted by the rabies virus.

ICAM-1 (D) is an adhesion molecule involved in immune responses and is not directly targeted by the rabies virus.

GABA (E) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is not directly targeted by the rabies virus.",
"A 60-year-old female patient with a history of hypertension presents to an outpatient office for regular check-up and is found to have hypertriglyceridemia. Her physician prescribes high-dose niacin and recommends taking the medication along with aspirin. The side effect the physician is trying to avoid is thought to be mediated by what mechanism?
Options:
(A): Bile deposition in the dermis
(B): Immune complex formation
(C): Release of prostaglandins
(D): Mast cell degranulation
(E): T cell activation
",Release of prostaglandins,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Release of prostaglandins.

Explanation:
The side effect that the physician is trying to avoid by recommending aspirin along with high-dose niacin is mediated by the release of prostaglandins. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is commonly used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. However, it can cause flushing, which is characterized by redness, warmth, and itching of the skin. This flushing occurs due to the release of prostaglandins, which are lipid compounds that have various physiological effects, including vasodilation and inflammation. Aspirin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), can inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins and reduce the flushing side effect of niacin. Therefore, taking aspirin along with niacin helps to minimize the flushing reaction.",
"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician after elevated liver function tests were found after a routine screening. He has had occasional headaches over the past year, but otherwise feels well. The patient reports that he was involved in a severe car accident 30 years ago. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. He has never used illicit intravenous drugs. He takes no medications and has no known allergies. His father had a history of alcoholism and died of liver cancer. The patient appears thin. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 10,000/mm3
Platelet count 146,000/mm3
Serum
Glucose 150 mg/dL
Albumin 3.2 g/dL
Total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL

A liver biopsy is performed and shows mononuclear infiltrates that are limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy
(B): Tenofovir and velpatasvir therapy
(C): Interferon and ribavirin therapy
(D): Tenofovir and entecavir therapy
(E): Schedule a follow-up in 6 months
",Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir therapy.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has elevated liver function tests and positive hepatitis C antibody and RNA, indicating chronic hepatitis C infection. The liver biopsy findings of mononuclear infiltrates limited to portal tracts and periportal hepatocyte necrosis are consistent with chronic hepatitis C infection. The most appropriate next step in management is to initiate antiviral therapy for hepatitis C.

Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that are highly effective in treating hepatitis C. They are recommended as the first-line treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C infection, regardless of genotype. Sofosbuvir is a nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor, and ledipasvir is an NS5A inhibitor. The combination of these two drugs has been shown to have high rates of sustained virologic response (SVR) and is well-tolerated.

Tenofovir and velpatasvir therapy (choice B) is a combination therapy used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection, not hepatitis C.

Interferon and ribavirin therapy (choice C) was previously used as the standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection. However, it has been largely replaced by the more effective and better-tolerated DAA regimens, such as sofosbuvir and ledipasvir.

Tenofovir and entecavir therapy (choice D) are antiviral medications used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B infection, not hepatitis C.

Scheduling a follow-up in 6 months (choice E) without initiating antiviral therapy would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient has evidence of chronic hepatitis C infection and may benefit from early treatment to prevent disease progression and complications.",
"A 44-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of tingling in her feet and poor balance. Her only medication is levothyroxine. Physical examination shows conjunctival pallor and an ataxic gait. Proprioception and sense of vibration are decreased in her toes bilaterally. Laboratory studies show macrocytic anemia and normal thyroid hormone levels. Histological evaluation of tissue samples obtained by esophagogastroduodenoscopy reveals atrophic changes of the gastric body and fundus with normal antral mucosa. Which of the following structures is most likely being targeted by antibodies in this patient?
Options:
(A): Islet cell cytoplasm
(B): Deamidated gliadin peptide
(C): Parietal cells
(D): Smooth muscle
(E): Erythrocytes
",Parietal cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Parietal cells.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with pernicious anemia, which is caused by autoimmune destruction of the gastric parietal cells. Parietal cells are responsible for producing intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Destruction of these cells leads to vitamin B12 deficiency, resulting in macrocytic anemia. The patient's symptoms of tingling in her feet and poor balance are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which can occur due to vitamin B12 deficiency. The atrophic changes seen on histological evaluation of the gastric tissue further support the diagnosis of pernicious anemia.",
"A 26-year-old female complains of frequent, large volume urination. This negatively affects her sleep, as she has to frequently wake up at night to urinate. She also complains of increased thirst. Her past medical history is significant for bipolar disorder that is treated with lithium for 3 years. Serum osmolality is 425 mOsm/kg, and urine osmolality is 176 mOsm/kg. Which of the following best explains this patient’s serum and urine osmolality?
Options:
(A): Hypothalamic over-production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
(B): Decreased production of ADH
(C): ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts
(D): Increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion
(E): Increased aquaporin expression in the renal collecting ducts
",ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of frequent, large volume urination and increased thirst are consistent with diabetes insipidus (DI). DI is characterized by the inability to concentrate urine, leading to excessive urine output and increased thirst. In this case, the serum osmolality is elevated (425 mOsm/kg), indicating a state of hyperosmolality, while the urine osmolality is low (176 mOsm/kg), indicating an inability to concentrate urine.

The most likely cause of DI in this patient is ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts. ADH, also known as antidiuretic hormone or vasopressin, is responsible for regulating water reabsorption in the kidneys. In DI, there is either a decrease in ADH production or a decrease in the response of the renal collecting ducts to ADH.

In this case, the patient's history of lithium use is significant. Lithium is known to cause nephrogenic DI, which is characterized by ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts. This can lead to the inability to concentrate urine and excessive urine output.

Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's serum and urine osmolality is ADH resistance in the renal collecting ducts, as seen in nephrogenic DI.",
"An 8-year-old girl presents to her pediatrician with intensely pruritic lesions over her buttocks, as shown. These lesions occur intermittently but have worsened over time. Her medical history is remarkable for iron deficiency, for which she is on ferrous sulfate. The patient has also experienced intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea, previously diagnosed as lactose intolerance. Her height is at the 30th percentile and weight is at the 25th percentile for age and sex. An immunoglobulin A (IgA) tissue transglutaminase titer is 5 times the upper limit of normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Crohn’s disease
(B): Giardiasis
(C): Celiac disease
(D): Common variable immune deficiency
(E): Henoch-Schonlein purpura
",Celiac disease,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Celiac disease.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), which is a cutaneous manifestation of celiac disease. DH is characterized by intensely pruritic lesions that typically occur over the buttocks, elbows, knees, and scalp. These lesions are usually symmetric and may be vesicular or bullous in nature.

The patient's history of iron deficiency and intermittent episodes of mild diarrhea are also suggestive of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This immune response leads to damage to the small intestine, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients and various systemic manifestations.

The elevated IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) titer further supports the diagnosis of celiac disease. IgA tTG antibodies are highly sensitive and specific for celiac disease, and their presence indicates an immune response to gluten.

Crohn's disease (A) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and growth failure. However, it is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms and presentation are more consistent with celiac disease.

Giardiasis (B) is a parasitic infection caused by Giardia lamblia. It can cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malabsorption, but it is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms are chronic and not solely related to episodes of infection.

Common variable immune deficiency (D) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins and recurrent infections. It is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms and presentation are more consistent with celiac disease.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (E) is a systemic vasculitis that typically presents with palpable purpura, joint pain, abdominal pain, and renal involvement. It is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms and presentation are more consistent with celiac disease.",
"A 64-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of lower back pain, fever, and chills. He has had nausea but no vomiting during this time. He has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Three months ago, he underwent amputation of his left third toe because of a non-healing ulcer. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and insulin. His temperature is 39.4°C (102.9°F), pulse is 102/min, blood pressure is 150/94 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Examination shows a 1-cm (0.4-in) round ulcer on the sole of his right foot.

Options:
(A): Inpatient treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin
(B): Outpatient treatment with oral levofloxacin
(C): Outpatient treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(D): Initiate hemodialysis
(E): Perform CT scan with contrast of the abdomen
",Inpatient treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Inpatient treatment with intravenous ciprofloxacin.

Explanation:
This patient presents with symptoms and signs consistent with pyelonephritis, which is a severe infection of the kidneys. The presence of fever, chills, and costovertebral angle tenderness, along with the laboratory findings of leukocytosis and pyuria with WBC casts in the urine, strongly suggest an upper urinary tract infection. The patient's risk factors for complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) include diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and recent foot amputation. In addition, the patient's elevated serum creatinine level suggests underlying renal dysfunction, which further supports the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.

Given the severity of the infection and the patient's risk factors, inpatient treatment with intravenous antibiotics is the most appropriate next step in management. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that provides broad coverage against the most common pathogens causing UTIs, including Escherichia coli. Intravenous administration ensures adequate drug levels and allows for close monitoring of the patient's response to treatment. Oral antibiotics, such as levofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, may be considered for outpatient treatment of uncomplicated UTIs, but in this case, inpatient treatment is warranted.

Initiating hemodialysis or performing a CT scan with contrast of the abdomen are not indicated at this time. Hemodialysis is typically reserved for patients with severe renal dysfunction or complications of kidney disease, such as uremia or fluid overload. A CT scan with contrast may be useful in evaluating the extent of infection or identifying other sources of infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.",
"A 56-year-old man with a history of pancreatic cancer presents to the surgical intensive care unit following a pancreaticoduodenectomy. Over the next 3 days, the patient's drainage output is noted to exceed 1 liter per day. In the early morning of postoperative day 4, the nurse states that the patient is difficult to arouse. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/88 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. His skin and mucous membranes are dry on physical exam. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 154 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): 0.45% saline IV
(B): 0.9% saline IV
(C): 5% dextrose IV
(D): 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV
(E): Oral free water replacement
",0.9% saline IV,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) 0.9% saline IV.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with signs of dehydration, including dry skin and mucous membranes, and is difficult to arouse. The laboratory values also show a high serum sodium level (154 mEq/L), indicating hypernatremia. Hypernatremia is often caused by a deficit of free water in the body, which can occur due to excessive fluid losses or inadequate fluid intake.

Given the patient's history of pancreatic cancer and the excessive drainage output, it is likely that he is experiencing significant fluid losses. Therefore, the best next step in management would be to administer intravenous fluids to rehydrate the patient.

The choice of 0.9% saline IV is appropriate because it is a isotonic solution that will help restore the patient's fluid volume without causing any significant shifts in electrolyte balance. This solution contains sodium chloride in the same concentration as that found in the extracellular fluid, making it an effective choice for rehydration.

Options (A) 0.45% saline IV and (D) 5% dextrose IV with 0.45% saline IV are not the best choices because they are hypotonic solutions that may worsen the patient's hypernatremia by diluting the extracellular fluid further.

Option (C) 5% dextrose IV is not the best choice because it does not provide any electrolytes and may not adequately address the patient's fluid deficit.

Option (E) oral free water replacement is not the best choice in this scenario because the patient is difficult to arouse and may not be able to tolerate oral intake. Intravenous fluids are necessary to rapidly rehydrate the patient.",
"A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of diarrhea, moderate abdominal pain, and weakness. Her symptoms began on the return flight from a 2-week yoga retreat in India, where she stayed at a resort. She was mildly nauseous as she boarded the flight, and diarrhea followed immediately after eating the in-flight meal. Since then, she has had up to five watery stools daily. She has a 1-year history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and is allergic to shellfish. Her only medication is ranitidine. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg. Abdominal examination shows diffuse tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen?
Options:
(A): Giardia intestinalis
(B): Shigella species
(C): Staphylococcus aureus
(D): Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli
(E): Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli
",Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness, along with the history of recent travel to India, the most likely pathogen causing her symptoms is Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). ETEC is a common cause of traveler's diarrhea, especially in developing countries. It is typically transmitted through contaminated food or water and can cause watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weakness. The patient's symptoms starting after eating the in-flight meal and the hyperactive bowel sounds are consistent with ETEC infection. Giardia intestinalis is less likely in this case because the symptoms are more acute and not chronic. Shigella species and Staphylococcus aureus are also less likely as they typically cause more severe symptoms such as bloody diarrhea and fever. Enteroinvasive Escherichia coli is also less likely as it typically causes invasive diarrhea with fever and bloody stools.",
"A research group has created a novel screening test for a rare disorder. A robust clinical trial is performed in a group of 100 subjects comparing the new screening test against the gold standard. The results are given in the table below:
Screening test\gold standard Disease present Disease absent
Positive 45 15
Negative 5 35
Which of the following is most correct regarding the statistical power of this new screening test?
Options:
(A): The new screening test has greater statistical power than the gold standard.
(B): Repeating the study would have no effect on the statistical power of the screening test.
(C): The power of the test is 0.8.
(D): If the specificity of this screening test were increased, the statistical power would increase.
(E): If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.
","If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): If the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.

Explanation:
Statistical power refers to the ability of a study to detect a true effect or difference if it exists. In the context of a screening test, statistical power is related to the ability of the test to correctly identify individuals with the disease (sensitivity) and correctly identify individuals without the disease (specificity).

In this case, the sensitivity of the screening test is calculated as the proportion of patients with the disease who have a positive test result. The sensitivity is calculated as 45/(45+5) = 0.9, or 90%.

If the sensitivity of the screening test were decreased, it means that the test would be less able to correctly identify individuals with the disease. This would result in more false-negative results, where individuals with the disease are incorrectly classified as not having the disease. As a result, the statistical power of the test would decrease because it would be less likely to detect true cases of the disease.

Therefore, if the sensitivity of this screening test were decreased, the statistical power would decrease.",
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her new family physician for a follow-up appointment. She previously presented with itching, as well as frequent and painful urination. A vaginal swab was taken and sent to the laboratory to confirm the diagnosis. Diplococci were seen on Gram stain and were grown on Thayer-Martin agar. When discussing her infection, the patient says that she uses safe sex practices. Her history is significant for meningitis and for infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. The physician discusses that the reason behind these infections comes from a defect in the innate immune system. Which of the following best describes the component that is likely deficient in this patient?
Options:
(A): Acts as an important opsonin  
(B): Plays a role in angioedema
(C): Degraded by C1 esterase inhibitor
(D): Creates pores in the cell membrane
(E): Induces the alternative complement pathway
",Creates pores in the cell membrane,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Creates pores in the cell membrane.

Explanation:
The patient's history of meningitis and infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae suggests a deficiency in the innate immune system. The component that is likely deficient in this patient is one that plays a role in creating pores in the cell membrane. This is because the ability to create pores in the cell membrane is important for the innate immune system to effectively kill and eliminate pathogens. Deficiencies in this component can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, as seen in this patient.",
"A 55-year-old woman with papillary thyroid carcinoma underwent total thyroidectomy. She has no significant medical history. On postoperative day 1, she develops perioral numbness and a tingling sensation, along with paresthesia of the hands and feet. The physical examination reveals that she is anxious and confused. Her pulse is 90/min, the blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, the respirations are 22/min, and the temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). Latent tetany (carpal spasm) is evident in the right arm. This is observed when the sphygmomanometer cuff pressure is raised above the systolic blood pressure and held for 3 minutes. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Serum calcium 6.7 mg/dL
Serum sodium 143 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.4 mEq/L
Serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Blood urea 16 mg/dL
Serum magnesium 1.1 mEq/L
What is the most likely cause of this condition?
Options:
(A): Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands
(B): Congenital absence of parathyroid glands
(C): DiGeorge syndrome
(D): Chronic hypomagnesemia
(E): Hungry bone syndrome
",Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Inadvertent surgical removal of parathyroid glands.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of perioral numbness, tingling sensation, paresthesia of the hands and feet, along with carpal spasm (latent tetany), are consistent with hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia is a common complication after total thyroidectomy, occurring in up to 20% of patients. The most likely cause of hypocalcemia in this patient is inadvertent surgical removal of the parathyroid glands during the thyroidectomy. The parathyroid glands are responsible for producing parathyroid hormone (PTH), which regulates calcium levels in the body. Removal or damage to the parathyroid glands can lead to decreased PTH production and subsequent hypocalcemia. The low serum calcium level of 6.7 mg/dL further supports this diagnosis.

Congenital absence of parathyroid glands (choice B) is a rare condition and is unlikely in this patient who had no significant medical history prior to the thyroidectomy.

DiGeorge syndrome (choice C) is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the thymus and parathyroid glands. However, this syndrome is typically diagnosed in infancy or childhood and is unlikely to be the cause of hypocalcemia in this patient.

Chronic hypomagnesemia (choice D) can lead to hypocalcemia, but the patient's serum magnesium level of 1.1 mEq/L is within the normal range. Additionally, the most likely cause of hypomagnesemia in this patient is the surgical removal of the parathyroid glands, rather than a chronic deficiency.

Hungry bone syndrome (choice E) is a condition that can occur after parathyroidectomy, where the bones rapidly take up calcium, leading to severe hypocalcemia. However, this syndrome typically occurs several days to weeks after surgery, not on postoperative day 1 as in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is inadvertent surgical removal of the parathyroid glands during the thyroidectomy.",
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for the evaluation of fatigue for several weeks. The parents report that their son quit doing sports at school because of low energy. The patient's academic performance has declined recently. He spends most of his time in the basement playing video games and eating bowls of cereal. He has no history of serious illness. His mother has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and his father has major depressive disorder. The patient does not smoke or drink alcohol. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the finger nails. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 76 μm3
Platelet count 290,000/mm3
Red cell distribution width 18% (N = 13%–15%)
Leukocyte count 7,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?""
Options:
(A): Regular blood transfusions
(B): Fluoxetine
(C): Methylphenidate
(D): Iron supplementation
(E): Allogenic stem cell transplantation
",Iron supplementation,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Iron supplementation.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is a common cause of fatigue and decreased energy levels. The patient's history of spending most of his time playing video games and eating bowls of cereal suggests a poor diet, which can contribute to iron deficiency. The examination findings of conjunctival pallor, inflammation and fissuring of the corners of the mouth, and concavity of the finger nails are classic signs of iron deficiency anemia.

The laboratory studies also support the diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. The hemoglobin level is low (11.5 g/dL), indicating anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is low (76 μm3), which is consistent with microcytic anemia seen in iron deficiency. The red cell distribution width (RDW) is elevated (18%), indicating increased variation in red blood cell size, which is also seen in iron deficiency anemia.

The most appropriate initial step in treatment for iron deficiency anemia is iron supplementation. This will help replenish the body's iron stores and improve the patient's symptoms of fatigue and low energy. Regular blood transfusions (option A) are not necessary in this case as the patient's anemia is not severe enough to require immediate transfusion. Fluoxetine (option B) and methylphenidate (option C) are medications used for the treatment of depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, respectively, but they are not indicated in this patient. Allogenic stem cell transplantation (option E) is a treatment option for certain hematologic disorders, but it is not indicated in this patient with iron deficiency anemia.",
"A 78-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of painful enlarging bruises and skin ulceration over his thighs and external genitalia. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, mitral regurgitation, and atrial fibrillation. Three days ago, he was started on treatment with warfarin. His only other medications are metformin and lisinopril. His temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), pulse is 108/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 155/89 mm Hg. Examination of the skin shows large purpura, hemorrhagic bullae, and areas of skin necrosis over his anterior legs, gluteal region, and penis. This patient is most likely to benefit from treatment with which of the following?
Options:
(A): Hyperbaric oxygen
(B): Protein C concentrate
(C): Argatroban
(D): Tranexamic acid
(E): Vancomycin
""
",Protein C concentrate,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Protein C concentrate.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. Warfarin inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, including protein C and protein S, which are natural anticoagulants. In patients with protein C deficiency, warfarin therapy can lead to a transient hypercoagulable state, resulting in microvascular thrombosis and subsequent skin necrosis. The skin necrosis typically occurs in areas with high fat content, such as the thighs, breasts, and buttocks. Treatment involves discontinuation of warfarin and administration of protein C concentrate to correct the underlying deficiency. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial in some cases, but it is not the primary treatment for warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor and would not be effective in this case. Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent and would not address the underlying deficiency of protein C. Vancomycin is an antibiotic and is not indicated in the treatment of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.",
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of a learning disability. His teachers have reported hyperactivity during class, difficulties with social interaction, and poor scores on reading and writing assessments. Molecular analysis shows an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats. Which of the following findings are most likely to be seen on physical examination of this patient?
Options:
(A): Frontal balding and cataracts
(B): Long face and large everted ears
(C): Almond-shaped eyes and downturned mouth
(D): Flat facies and protruding tongue
(E): Thin upper lip and receding chin
",Long face and large everted ears,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): Long face and large everted ears.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation described in the question stem is consistent with Fragile X syndrome, which is caused by an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats on the FMR1 gene. Physical examination findings commonly seen in individuals with Fragile X syndrome include a long face and large everted ears. Other common features of Fragile X syndrome include macroorchidism (enlarged testicles), hyperextensible joints, and mitral valve prolapse. However, these findings are not mentioned in the question stem. Therefore, the most likely physical examination findings in this patient would be a long face and large everted ears.",
"A 65-year-old woman presented to the emergency room due to progressive dyspnea. She is a known hypertensive but is poorly compliant with medications. The patient claims to have orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and easy fatigability. On physical examination, the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. There is prominent neck vein distention. An S3 gallop, bibasilar crackles, and grade 3 bipedal edema were also detected. A 2d echo was performed, which showed a decreased ejection fraction (32%). Which of the following drugs should not be given to this patient?
Options:
(A): Furosemide
(B): Nesiritide
(C): Metoprolol
(D): Digoxin
(E): Dobutamine
",Metoprolol,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Metoprolol.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with symptoms and signs consistent with heart failure, including dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fatigue, jugular venous distention, S3 gallop, crackles, and peripheral edema. The decreased ejection fraction on the 2d echo indicates systolic dysfunction. In this patient, the blood pressure is already low (80/50 mm Hg), indicating poor cardiac output. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can further decrease cardiac output and worsen hypotension in patients with heart failure. Therefore, it should not be given to this patient. 

Furosemide (A) is a loop diuretic that is commonly used in the treatment of heart failure to reduce fluid overload. It helps to relieve symptoms of congestion by promoting diuresis. It is an appropriate choice for this patient.

Nesiritide (B) is a recombinant form of human B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) that is used in the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure. It promotes vasodilation and diuresis, and it can be used in patients with heart failure and low blood pressure. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this patient and is not the best choice in this scenario.

Digoxin (D) is a cardiac glycoside that can be used in patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. It has positive inotropic effects and can improve symptoms and reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure. It is not contraindicated in this patient and can be considered as part of the treatment regimen.

Dobutamine (E) is a beta-1 adrenergic agonist that can be used in patients with acute decompensated heart failure and low blood pressure. It has positive inotropic effects and can improve cardiac output. It is an appropriate choice for this patient.",
"A 49-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with progressive dyspnea and cough which she developed approx. 8 hours ago. 2 weeks ago she had a prophylactic ovariectomy because of a family history of ovarian cancer. She is known to have type 2 diabetes mellitus and stage 1 hypertension, but she does not take her antihypertensives because she is not concerned about her blood pressure. Also, she has a history of opioid abuse. She takes metformin 1000 mg and aspirin 81 mg. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for 22 years. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 155/80 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 31/min, and temperature 37.9℃ (100.2℉). Blood saturation on room air is 89%. On examination, the patient is dyspneic and acrocyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral rales over the lower lobes. A cardiac examination is significant for S2 accentuation best heard in the second intercostal space at the left sternal border and S3 presence. There is no leg edema. Neurological examination is within normal limits. Arterial blood gases analysis shows the following results:
pH 7.49
PaO2 58 mm Hg
PaCO2 30 mm Hg
HCO3-  22 mEq/L
Based on the given data, which of the following could cause respiratory failure in this patient?
Options:
(A): Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli
(B): Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons
(C): Alveolar fibrosis
(D): Depression of the respiratory center via opioid receptors activation
(E): Decreased V/Q due to bronchial obstruction
",Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with progressive dyspnea, cough, acrocyanosis, and bilateral rales on lung auscultation. These findings, along with the arterial blood gas analysis showing a low PaO2 and normal or low PaCO2, suggest respiratory failure.

The given information also reveals that the patient has a history of opioid abuse. Opioids can cause respiratory depression by activating opioid receptors in the respiratory center of the brainstem, leading to decreased respiratory drive and hypoventilation. However, the arterial blood gas analysis in this patient shows a low PaO2 and normal or low PaCO2, which is not consistent with opioid-induced respiratory depression. Therefore, option (D) is incorrect.

Alveolar fibrosis (option C) is a condition characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the alveoli, which can impair gas exchange. However, the patient's symptoms and findings on examination, such as acrocyanosis and bilateral rales, are not consistent with alveolar fibrosis. Therefore, option (C) is incorrect.

Bronchial obstruction (option E) can lead to decreased ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) matching, resulting in impaired gas exchange. However, the patient's symptoms and findings on examination, such as acrocyanosis and bilateral rales, are not consistent with bronchial obstruction. Therefore, option (E) is incorrect.

Ischemia of the medullary respiratory center neurons (option B) can cause respiratory failure by impairing the function of the respiratory center in the brainstem. However, there is no evidence in the given information to suggest ischemia as the cause of respiratory failure in this patient. Therefore, option (B) is incorrect.

The most likely cause of respiratory failure in this patient is increased alveolar dead space due to absent perfusion of certain alveoli (option A). The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea and acrocyanosis, along with the arterial blood gas analysis showing a low PaO2, suggest impaired oxygenation. This can occur when certain alveoli are not adequately perfused, leading to ventilation without perfusion (V/Q mismatch) and resulting in increased alveolar dead space. The presence of rales on lung auscultation also supports this explanation.",
"A 27-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute onset bloody diarrhea. The patient has had severe abdominal pain throughout her entire life with occasional episodes of bloody diarrhea. She has recently lost 7 pounds and has felt generally ill for the past 2 days. She has a past medical history of generalized seizures with her most recent one having occurred 5 days ago. One month ago, the patient was treated for impetigo. The patient admits to occasional cocaine use and binge drinking. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 127/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air.

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient's laboratory findings?
Options:
(A): Alcohol-induced liver injury
(B): Immune response to streptococcal infection
(C): Intestinal IgA deficiency
(D): Myoglobin toxicity
(E): Protein deposition
",Protein deposition,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Protein deposition.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings, including a positive urine protein test, suggest protein deposition as the best explanation for her symptoms. The presence of protein in the urine, known as proteinuria, can be indicative of various underlying conditions. In this case, the patient's history of severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss, along with the positive urine protein test, suggests a possible inflammatory or autoimmune condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract.

The patient's history of occasional episodes of bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal pain throughout her life, along with the recent acute onset of bloody diarrhea and weight loss, raises suspicion for a chronic inflammatory condition such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD, which includes conditions like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, can cause inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestines, leading to the release of proteins into the urine.

The positive urine protein test, along with the diffuse abdominal tenderness and guaiac positive stools (indicating the presence of blood in the stool), further supports the possibility of an inflammatory condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract. Other laboratory findings, such as the normal leukocyte count and absence of leukocytosis, make an acute infection less likely as the cause of the symptoms.

The patient's history of impetigo, generalized seizures, and positive urine tests for cocaine and marijuana are not directly related to the laboratory findings and are unlikely to be the primary cause of the symptoms.

Alcohol-induced liver injury (option A) typically presents with elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and may cause liver dysfunction, but it is not the best explanation for the patient's laboratory findings in this case.

An immune response to streptococcal infection (option B) would typically present with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes, which are not described in the patient's presentation.

Intestinal IgA deficiency (option C) is a genetic condition that can lead to increased susceptibility to infections, particularly in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. However, it is not the best explanation for the patient's laboratory findings in this case.

Myoglobin toxicity (option D) typically occurs in the setting of rhabdomyolysis, which is characterized by muscle breakdown and release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. This can lead to kidney damage and the presence of myoglobin in the urine (myoglobinuria). However, there is no evidence of muscle breakdown or elevated creatine kinase levels in the patient's presentation, making myoglobin toxicity an unlikely explanation for the laboratory findings.",
"A 45-year-old Caucasian male presents to a gastroenterologist complaining of heartburn and difficulty swallowing. He recalls that he has been told by his primary care physician that he suffers from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The gastroenterologist decides to perform an upper endoscopy with biopsy. Which of the following findings would be consistent with Barrett's esophagus?
Options:
(A): Presence of Paneth cells in the lower esophagus
(B): Metaplasia in the upper esophagus
(C): A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus
(D): Esophageal varices
(E): Neutrophilic infiltration
","A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus",Correct,"The correct choice is (C): A small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus.

Explanation:
Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which metaplastic columnar epithelium replaces the normal squamous epithelium that lines the distal esophagus. It is a complication of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and is associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus is generally established by upper endoscopy and biopsy.

The characteristic finding of Barrett's esophagus on endoscopy is the presence of a small region of red, velvet-like mucosa in the lower esophagus. This mucosa is different from the normal squamous epithelium and is indicative of metaplastic columnar epithelium. Biopsy specimens from this mucosa must reveal intestinal metaplasia characterized by the presence of goblet cells to confirm the diagnosis.

Option (A) is incorrect because the presence of Paneth cells in the lower esophagus is not consistent with Barrett's esophagus. Paneth cells are typically found in the small intestine and are not a characteristic feature of Barrett's esophagus.

Option (B) is incorrect because metaplasia in the upper esophagus is not consistent with Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus specifically refers to metaplastic columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus.

Option (D) is incorrect because esophageal varices are not a characteristic finding of Barrett's esophagus. Esophageal varices are dilated blood vessels that occur in the setting of portal hypertension, typically due to liver cirrhosis.

Option (E) is incorrect because neutrophilic infiltration is not a specific finding of Barrett's esophagus. Neutrophilic infiltration can occur in various inflammatory conditions of the esophagus, but it is not specific to Barrett's esophagus.",
"A 16-year-old female patient with a history of mental retardation presents to your clinic with her mother. The mother states that she wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation after she recently discovered her looking at pornographic materials. She states that her daughter is not capable of understanding the repercussions of sexual intercourse, and that she does not want her to be burdened with a child that she would not be able to raise. Upon discussions with the patient, it is clear that she is not able to understand that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy. What should your next step be?
Options:
(A): Schedule the patient for the requested surgery
(B): Wait until the patient is 18 years old, and then schedule for surgery
(C): Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy
(D): Refer the patient to a psychiatrist to get informed consent
(E): Refuse the procedure because it is unlikely that the patient will get pregnant
",Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Refuse the procedure because it violates the ethical principle of autonomy.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient is a 16-year-old female with a history of mental retardation who does not have the capacity to understand the repercussions of sexual intercourse and pregnancy. The mother wants her daughter to have a bilateral tubal ligation to prevent her from getting pregnant. However, it is important to consider the ethical principle of autonomy, which states that individuals have the right to make decisions about their own bodies and healthcare.

In this situation, the patient lacks the capacity to provide informed consent for the surgery. It would be ethically inappropriate to proceed with the surgery without the patient's understanding and consent. Therefore, the next step should be to refuse the procedure.

It is important to respect the autonomy of individuals, especially when they may not have the capacity to fully understand the consequences of their decisions. In this case, the patient's inability to understand the repercussions of sexual intercourse and pregnancy indicates that she lacks the capacity to provide informed consent for the surgery.",
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of malaise. He returned from a research trip to Madagascar 2 weeks ago and has since developed a worsening fever with a maximum temperature of 102.2°F (39°C). He also reports some swelling around his neck and groin. He works as a zoologist and was in rural Madagascar studying a rare species of lemur. His past medical history is notable for hypertension and gout. He takes lisinopril and allopurinol. His temperature is 101.9°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On exam, he has painful erythematous cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Black hemorrhagic eschars are noted on his fingertips bilaterally. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition produces a virulence factor that has which of the following functions?
Options:
(A): Cleave immunoglobulin
(B): Inhibit leukocyte migration
(C): Inhibit phagocytosis
(D): Inhibit ribosomal function
(E): Trigger widespread inflammation
",Inhibit phagocytosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Inhibit phagocytosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, he likely has an infection caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is the causative agent of bubonic plague. The presence of painful erythematous lymphadenopathy, black hemorrhagic eschars on the fingertips (known as ""black death""), and recent travel to an endemic area are all consistent with bubonic plague.

Yersinia pestis produces a virulence factor called the F1 antigen, which is a capsule that inhibits phagocytosis by host immune cells. Phagocytosis is an important defense mechanism of the immune system, where immune cells engulf and destroy pathogens. By inhibiting phagocytosis, Yersinia pestis is able to evade the immune response and establish infection.

The other options are not correct:
(A) Cleave immunoglobulin: This is not a function of Yersinia pestis. Immunoglobulins are antibodies produced by the immune system to help fight off infections.
(B) Inhibit leukocyte migration: While Yersinia pestis can inhibit leukocyte migration to some extent, this is not the primary function of the virulence factor in this case.
(D) Inhibit ribosomal function: Yersinia pestis does not inhibit ribosomal function. Ribosomes are cellular structures involved in protein synthesis and are not directly targeted by this bacterium.
(E) Trigger widespread inflammation: While Yersinia pestis infection can lead to inflammation, the primary function of the virulence factor in this case is to inhibit phagocytosis, not trigger widespread inflammation.",
"A 45-year-old African-American male presents to the family medicine physician to assess the status of his diabetes. After reviewing the laboratory tests, the physician decides to write the patient a prescription for miglitol and states that it must be taken with the first bite of the meal. Which of the following bonds will no longer be cleaved when the patient takes miglitol?
Options:
(A): Phosphodiester bonds
(B): Glycosidic bonds
(C): Peptide bonds
(D): Cystine bonds
(E): Hydrogen bonds
",Glycosidic bonds,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Glycosidic bonds.

Explanation:
Miglitol is an oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes. It belongs to a class of drugs called alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. These drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which is responsible for breaking down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars in the small intestine.

When miglitol is taken with the first bite of a meal, it acts locally in the small intestine to inhibit the cleavage of glycosidic bonds. Glycosidic bonds are the bonds that link sugar molecules together to form complex carbohydrates like starch and sucrose. By inhibiting the cleavage of these bonds, miglitol slows down the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, leading to a slower and more controlled rise in blood sugar levels after a meal.

In contrast, the other options listed do not apply to the mechanism of action of miglitol. Phosphodiester bonds are found in nucleic acids, not carbohydrates. Peptide bonds are found in proteins, not carbohydrates. Cystine bonds are a type of disulfide bond found in proteins, not carbohydrates. Hydrogen bonds are weak bonds that are not directly involved in the cleavage of glycosidic bonds.",
"A previously healthy 24-year-old man comes to the physician 1 day after the onset of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger. He works as a dental assistant and is concerned about not being able to work. The patient wonders if the symptoms might be related to a hunting trip he returned from 1 week ago because he remembers seeing a lot of poison oak. He is sexually active with one female partner, and they do not use condoms. His father has a history of thromboangiitis obliterans. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 5 years. He drinks two to four beers on social occasions. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows swelling and erythema of the pulp space of the left index finger; there are multiple 3-mm vesicles. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 12,000 cells/mm3. In addition to supportive therapy, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Oral acyclovir
(B): Incision and drainage of the pulp space
(C): Oral cephalexin
(D): Smoking cessation
(E): Washing thoroughly
""
",Oral acyclovir,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Oral acyclovir.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of burning pain, swelling, and multiple blisters over the left index finger, as well as the presence of vesicles and leukocytosis, the most likely diagnosis is herpetic whitlow. Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), typically HSV-1. It commonly affects healthcare workers who come into contact with oral secretions or saliva, such as dental assistants. The patient's exposure to poison oak is not likely to be related to his symptoms.

Oral acyclovir is the treatment of choice for herpetic whitlow. Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog that inhibits viral DNA synthesis and replication. It can help reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, as well as prevent complications such as secondary bacterial infection. Incision and drainage of the pulp space (choice B) is not indicated in the management of herpetic whitlow. Oral cephalexin (choice C) is an antibiotic and would not be effective against a viral infection. Smoking cessation (choice D) is important for overall health but is not the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's symptoms. Washing thoroughly (choice E) may help prevent the spread of the infection but is not sufficient as a standalone treatment for herpetic whitlow.",
"A 63-year-old man presents to the ambulatory medical clinic with symptoms of dysphagia and ‘heartburn’, which he states have become more troublesome over the past year. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and GERD. He takes lisinopril for hypertension and has failed multiple different therapies for his GERD. On physical exam, he is somewhat tender to palpation over his upper abdomen. Barium swallow demonstrates a subdiaphragmatic gastroesophageal junction, with herniation of the gastric fundus into the left hemithorax. Given the following options, what is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient’s underlying condition?
Options:
(A): Lifestyle modification
(B): Combined antacid therapy
(C): Continue on Cimetidine
(D): Continue on Omeprazole
(E): Surgical gastropexy
",Surgical gastropexy,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Surgical gastropexy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn, along with the physical exam findings of tenderness over the upper abdomen and the barium swallow showing herniation of the gastric fundus into the left hemithorax, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's underlying condition is surgical gastropexy.

Surgical gastropexy is the surgical fixation of the stomach to the abdominal wall, which helps to prevent further herniation and alleviate the symptoms of GERD. This procedure is indicated in cases of paraesophageal hernias, which is likely the underlying condition in this patient.

Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding trigger foods and elevating the head of the bed, may be helpful in managing GERD symptoms, but they are not sufficient in treating a paraesophageal hernia.

Combined antacid therapy, such as using both H2 blockers (like cimetidine) and proton pump inhibitors (like omeprazole), may be used to manage GERD symptoms, but they do not address the underlying herniation of the stomach.

Continuing on cimetidine or omeprazole alone would not be sufficient in managing the patient's symptoms and addressing the underlying condition of the paraesophageal hernia.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's underlying condition is surgical gastropexy.",
"A 63-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic instability. Several days prior, he had been swimming in the Gulf coast when he stepped on a sharp rock and cut his right foot. Three days ago, the patient presented to the emergency room after noticing painful redness spreading along his skin up from his right foot and was subsequently admitted for antibiotic treatment. Currently, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 84/46 mmHg with a mean arterial pressure of 59 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, and respirations are 14/min. His telemetry shows sinus tachycardia. His blood cultures are pending, but Gram stain demonstrated gram-negative bacilli. Which of the following best describes the form of shock and the skin exam?
Options:
(A): Cardiogenic shock with cold skin
(B): Distributive shock with warm skin
(C): Hypovolemic shock with warm skin
(D): Neurogenic shock with cold skin
(E): Obstructive shock with cold skin
",Distributive shock with warm skin,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Distributive shock with warm skin.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing distributive shock. Distributive shock is characterized by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, leading to inadequate tissue perfusion. This can be caused by various factors, including sepsis, anaphylaxis, or neurogenic causes.

The patient's presentation is consistent with distributive shock due to a possible infection from the cut on his foot. The presence of gram-negative bacilli on Gram stain suggests a possible bacterial infection. The patient's vital signs, including a low blood pressure, tachycardia, and elevated temperature, are also consistent with distributive shock.

The skin exam is described as warm. In distributive shock, there is vasodilation of the peripheral blood vessels, leading to warm skin. This is in contrast to other forms of shock, such as cardiogenic or hypovolemic shock, where the skin is typically cold due to vasoconstriction.

Therefore, the best description of the form of shock and the skin exam in this patient is distributive shock with warm skin.",
"A 24-year-old female presents to the emergency department with a chief complaint of an inability to urinate. She states that this has been one of many symptoms she has experienced lately. At times she has had trouble speaking and has noticed changes in her vision however these episodes occurred over a month ago and have resolved since then. Two days ago she experienced extreme pain in her face that was exacerbated with brushing her teeth and plucking out facial hairs. The patient has no relevant past medical history, however, the patient admits to being sexually abused by her boyfriend for the past year. Her current medications include ibuprofen for menstrual cramps. On physical exam it is noted that leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward. The patient's initial workup is started in the emergency department. Her vital signs are within normal limits and you note a pale and frightened young lady awaiting further care. Which of the following is the best initial test for this patient's chief complaint?
Options:
(A): Head CT
(B): Head MRI
(C): Lumbar puncture
(D): Post void residual volumes
(E): Domestic abuse screening and exploring patient's life stressors
",Head MRI,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Head MRI.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is concerning for multiple sclerosis (MS), which is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. The patient's symptoms of urinary retention, difficulty speaking, changes in vision, and facial pain are consistent with MS. The exacerbation of facial pain with activities such as brushing teeth and plucking facial hairs is characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia, which can be seen in MS. The physical exam finding of internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), where leftward gaze results in only the ipsilateral eye gazing leftward, is also suggestive of MS. INO is caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is commonly affected in MS.

The best initial test for evaluating suspected MS is a head MRI with and without contrast. This can help identify the presence of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which are characteristic of MS. A head CT is not the best initial test because it does not provide the same level of detail as an MRI for evaluating demyelinating lesions. A lumbar puncture may be performed to evaluate for the presence of oligoclonal bands and elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) index in the cerebrospinal fluid, which can support the diagnosis of MS. However, an MRI is typically performed first to identify the presence of demyelinating lesions before proceeding to a lumbar puncture. Post void residual volumes may be measured to evaluate for urinary retention, but this is not the best initial test for evaluating the patient's chief complaint. Domestic abuse screening and exploring the patient's life stressors are important aspects of the patient's care, but they are not the best initial test for evaluating her chief complaint of an inability to urinate.",
"A 54-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her brother for confusion and agitation. She is unable to personally give a history. Her brother says she has a problem with alcohol use and that he found an empty bottle of vodka on the counter at her home. She appears disheveled. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, and blood pressure is 140/95 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is confused and oriented only to person. She recalls 0 out of 3 words after 5 minutes. She cannot perform serial sevens and is unable to repeat seven digits forward and five in reverse sequence. Neurologic examination shows horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze. She has difficulty walking without assistance. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume 110 μm3
Platelet count 280,000/mm3
Which of the following is most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?""
Options:
(A): Oral chlordiazepoxide
(B): Intravenous thiamine
(C): Oral naltrexone
(D): Intravenous vitamin B12
(E): Intravenous glucose
""
",Intravenous thiamine,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Intravenous thiamine.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine deficiency is commonly seen in individuals with alcohol use disorder due to poor nutrition and impaired absorption. The classic triad of symptoms includes confusion, ophthalmoplegia (including horizontal nystagmus), and ataxia. Other findings may include memory impairment, confabulation, and peripheral neuropathy. If left untreated, Wernicke encephalopathy can progress to Korsakoff syndrome, which is characterized by severe memory impairment and confabulation.

The most appropriate initial treatment for this patient is intravenous thiamine. Thiamine is essential for normal brain function and metabolism, and prompt administration can prevent further neurologic damage. It is important to administer thiamine before glucose to avoid precipitating or worsening Wernicke encephalopathy. Glucose administration in the absence of thiamine can worsen thiamine deficiency and lead to the development of Wernicke encephalopathy.

Oral chlordiazepoxide (A) is a benzodiazepine that may be used for alcohol withdrawal, but it does not address the underlying thiamine deficiency and is not the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.

Oral naltrexone (C) is an opioid receptor antagonist that may be used for alcohol dependence, but it does not address the underlying thiamine deficiency and is not the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.

Intravenous vitamin B12 (D) is not the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause neurologic symptoms, but the patient's presentation is more consistent with thiamine deficiency. Additionally, the patient's laboratory studies do not suggest vitamin B12 deficiency.

Intravenous glucose (E) should be administered after thiamine to avoid precipitating or worsening Wernicke encephalopathy. Glucose administration in the absence of thiamine can worsen thiamine deficiency and lead to the development of Wernicke encephalopathy. Therefore, intravenous glucose is not the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient.",
"An 18-year-old woman makes an appointment with a gynecologist for her first gynecologic examination. She did not disclose her past medical history, but her sexual debut occurred with her boyfriend 3 weeks ago. She is now complaining of a yellow-green, diffuse, malodorous vaginal discharge that she noticed 1 week ago for the first time. She also reported mild pelvic and abdominal pain. cervical motion tenderness was noted during the pelvic examination. The gynecologist also noticed a pink and inflamed nulliparous cervix with a preponderance of small red punctate spots. There was a frothy white discharge with a malodorous odor in the vaginal vault. A wet mount was prepared for a light microscopic examination, which revealed numerous squamous cells and motile organisms. The gynecologist concluded that this was a sexually-transmitted infection. What is the causative organism?
Options:
(A): Chlamydia trachomatis
(B): Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(C): Ureaplasma urealyticum
(D): Trichomonas vaginalis
(E): Enterobius vermicularis
",Trichomonas vaginalis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Trichomonas vaginalis.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation described in the question, including the yellow-green, malodorous vaginal discharge, pelvic and abdominal pain, cervical motion tenderness, and inflamed cervix with red punctate spots, is consistent with trichomoniasis. Trichomonas vaginalis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. It is commonly associated with symptoms such as frothy white discharge and a malodorous odor. The presence of motile organisms on the wet mount further supports the diagnosis of trichomoniasis. 

Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae are both bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted infections, but they do not typically present with the same clinical features as trichomoniasis. Ureaplasma urealyticum is a bacterium that can cause genitourinary infections, but it is not a common cause of the symptoms described in the question. Enterobius vermicularis is a parasitic worm that causes pinworm infection, which is not associated with the symptoms or findings described in the question.",
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the physician by his daughter because of increasing forgetfulness over the past 3 years. Initially, he used to forget his children's names or forget to lock the house door. During the past year, he has gotten lost twice while returning from the grocery store and was unable to tell passersby his address. One time, he went to the park with his granddaughter and returned home alone without realizing he had forgotten her. His daughter says that over the past year, he has withdrawn himself from social gatherings and avoids making conversation. He does not sleep well at night. His daughter has hired a helper to cook and clean his home. On mental status examination, he is oriented only to person. He describes his mood as fair. Short- and long-term memory deficits are present. He appears indifferent about his memory lapses and says this is normal for someone his age. The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient is a drug that acts on which of the following neurotransmitters?
Options:
(A): γ-aminobutyric acid
(B): Serotonin
(C): Acetylcholine
(D): Dopamine
(E): Glutamate
",Acetylcholine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Acetylcholine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including increasing forgetfulness, getting lost, difficulty with memory, withdrawal from social gatherings, and sleep disturbances, are consistent with Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by a deficiency of acetylcholine in the brain. Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter involved in memory and cognitive function. Pharmacotherapy for Alzheimer's disease typically involves the use of cholinesterase inhibitors, which increase the availability of acetylcholine in the brain and help improve cognitive function. Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient would be a drug that acts on acetylcholine.",
"A 45-year-old mechanic presents to the emergency department complaining of acute-onset shortness of breath while repairing a plowing tractor for his neighbor. The patient denies having any history of asthma or respiratory symptoms, and does not smoke. His temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), pulse is 65/min, blood pressure is 126/86 mmHg, and respirations are 20/min. His oxygen saturation is 97%. On exam, he is pale and diaphoretic. His pupils are contracted. Diffuse wheezes are noted in all lung fields. What is the best treatment for his condition?
Options:
(A): Intubation
(B): Succinylcholine
(C): Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen
(D): Atropine and pralidoxime
(E): Inhaled albuterol and oxygen
",Atropine and pralidoxime,Incorrect,"The correct answer is (C): Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of acute-onset shortness of breath, pale and diaphoretic appearance, and wheezes on lung examination, the most likely diagnosis is acute bronchospasm or bronchoconstriction. This can be caused by various factors, such as exposure to allergens or irritants.

In this case, the patient's history of working on a plowing tractor suggests a possible exposure to chemicals or fumes that may have triggered the bronchospasm. The absence of a history of asthma or respiratory symptoms does not rule out the possibility of acute bronchospasm.

The treatment of choice for acute bronchospasm is inhaled bronchodilators, such as short-acting beta-agonists (SABA) like albuterol. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient's condition would be inhaled albuterol and oxygen (option E).

Intubation (option A) is not indicated in this patient as he is maintaining adequate oxygen saturation and does not have severe respiratory distress.

Succinylcholine (option B) is a neuromuscular blocking agent and is not indicated for the treatment of bronchospasm.

Atropine and pralidoxime (option D) are used in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning, which does not seem to be the cause of the patient's symptoms based on the given information.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): Inhaled ipratropium and oxygen.",
"A 3-year-old male is brought in to his pediatrician by his mother because she is concerned that he is not growing appropriately. Physical examination is notable for frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities. His axial skeleton appears normal. He is at the 7th percentile for height and 95th percentile for head circumference. He demonstrates normal intelligence and is able to speak in three-word sentences. He first sat up without support at twelve months and started walking at 24 months. Genetic analysis reveals an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor. Which of the following physiologic processes is most likely disrupted in this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Intramembranous ossification
(B): Osteoblast maturation
(C): Endochondral ossification
(D): Production of type I collagen
(E): Bone resorption
",Endochondral ossification,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Endochondral ossification.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's physical examination findings of frontal bossing and shortened upper and lower extremities, along with the genetic analysis revealing an activating mutation in a growth factor receptor, are consistent with a diagnosis of achondroplasia. Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal endochondral ossification, which is the process by which long bones grow in length.

In normal endochondral ossification, chondrocytes (cartilage cells) proliferate, become hypertrophic, and then undergo cell death, creating cavities that are later invaded by osteoblasts (bone-forming cells). The osteoblasts then lay down bone matrix material that becomes calcified, leading to the formation of trabecular bone. This process is disrupted in achondroplasia, resulting in shortened tubular bones.

The patient's normal intelligence and ability to speak in three-word sentences suggest that there is no cognitive impairment associated with achondroplasia. Additionally, the patient's ability to sit up without support at twelve months and start walking at 24 months is within the expected range for motor milestones in achondroplasia.

Intramembranous ossification (option A) is the process by which flat bones of the skull, pelvis, and clavicles develop directly from mesenchymal cells. This process is not primarily affected in achondroplasia.

Osteoblast maturation (option B) is an important step in bone formation, but it is not the primary process disrupted in achondroplasia.

Production of type I collagen (option D) is important for the formation of bone matrix, but it is not the primary process disrupted in achondroplasia.

Bone resorption (option E) is the process by which osteoclasts break down bone tissue. While bone remodeling involves both bone formation and resorption, the primary process disrupted in achondroplasia is endochondral ossification, not bone resorption.",
"A 59-year-old woman comes to the physician 2 weeks after noticing a lump in her left breast. Examination of the left breast shows a firm, nontender mass close to the nipple. Mammography shows an irregular calcified mass. A core needle biopsy shows invasive ductal carcinoma. Genetic analysis of this patient's cancer cells is most likely to show overexpression of which of the following genes?
Options:
(A): HER2
(B): TP53
(C): BCR-ABL
(D): BRCA-2
(E): BCL-2
",HER2,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) HER2.

Explanation:
Invasive ductal carcinoma is the most common type of breast cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. Genetic analysis of this patient's cancer cells is most likely to show overexpression of the HER2 gene.

HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a gene that codes for a protein involved in cell growth and division. Overexpression of the HER2 gene leads to an increased production of the HER2 protein, which can promote uncontrolled cell growth and division, contributing to the development and progression of breast cancer.

HER2 overexpression is associated with more aggressive breast cancer and a poorer prognosis. However, it also makes the cancer cells more susceptible to targeted therapies that specifically inhibit the HER2 protein, such as trastuzumab (Herceptin).

The other options listed (B) TP53, (C) BCR-ABL, (D) BRCA-2, and (E) BCL-2 are not typically associated with breast cancer. TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is commonly mutated in many types of cancer, but it is not specifically associated with breast cancer. BCR-ABL is a fusion gene associated with chronic myeloid leukemia. BRCA-2 is a gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, but it is not typically overexpressed in breast cancer. BCL-2 is a gene involved in regulating cell death (apoptosis), but it is not typically overexpressed in breast cancer.",
"A 45-year-old man comes to his primary-care doctor with his wife for a 4-week history of constipation. The patient reports that his bowel habits have changed from every day to every 3 or 4 days. He also now has to strain to pass stool. On further questioning, his wife has also noticed that he has seemed fatigued, with little interest in going on their usual afternoon walks. Medical history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, both managed medically. He was last seen for follow-up of these conditions 1 month ago. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the cellular target of the medicine that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Angiotensin-II receptors in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells
(B): Angiotensin-converting enzyme
(C): Calcium channels in the membranes of vascular smooth muscle cells
(D): Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule
(E): Na+/K+/2Cl- transporters in the membranes of epithelial cells in the ascending loop of Henle
",Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of constipation and fatigue are suggestive of hypokalemia, which can be caused by the use of thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics, such as hydrochlorothiazide, are commonly used to treat hypertension and can lead to increased excretion of potassium in the urine. The Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule is the cellular target of thiazide diuretics. Inhibition of this cotransporter leads to increased sodium and chloride excretion, as well as increased potassium excretion. This can result in hypokalemia, which can cause constipation and fatigue. Therefore, the most likely cellular target responsible for this patient's symptoms is the Na+/Cl- cotransporter in the membranes of epithelial cells in the distal convoluted tubule.",
"A 23-year-old man presents to the office for a circular, itchy rash over the abdomen that has been slowly getting worse for the past 2 weeks. The patient has a medical history of chronic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis for which he has prescriptions of topical hydrocortisone and fexofenadine. He smokes one-half pack of cigarettes every day. His vital signs include: blood pressure 128/76 mm Hg, heart rate 78/min, and respirations 12/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired but oriented. Examination of the skin reveals a 2 x 2 cm round and erythematous, annular plaque on the abdomen 3 cm to the left of the umbilicus. There are no vesicles, pustules, or papules. Auscultation of the heart reveals a 1/6 systolic murmur. Breath sounds are mildly coarse at the bases. A KOH preparation from the skin scraping confirms the presence of hyphae. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Itraconazole
(B): Griseofulvin
(C): Topical clobetasol
(D): Topical clindamycin
(E): Doxycycline
",Itraconazole,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Itraconazole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is tinea corporis, which is a fungal infection of the skin caused by dermatophytes. The circular, itchy rash with a clear center and raised border is characteristic of tinea corporis. The presence of hyphae on KOH preparation further supports this diagnosis.

The next best step in the management of tinea corporis is oral antifungal therapy. Itraconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication that is effective against dermatophytes and is the preferred treatment for tinea corporis. Griseofulvin is an alternative option, but it has a higher risk of side effects and drug interactions compared to itraconazole. Topical clobetasol is a potent corticosteroid and may provide symptomatic relief, but it does not treat the underlying fungal infection. Topical clindamycin and doxycycline are antibiotics and are not indicated for the treatment of fungal infections.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient with tinea corporis is to prescribe oral itraconazole.",
"A 12-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department for the evaluation of persistent bleeding from his nose over the past hour. The bleeding started spontaneously. He has no history of a similar episode. He takes no medications. There is no history of abnormal bleeding in the family. His vital signs are within normal limits. On examination, he is pressing a gauze against his left nostril while hyperextending his head. The gauze is stained with blood and upon withdrawal of the gauze blood slowly drips out of his left nostrils. There is no bleeding from the right nostril. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?
Options:
(A): Anterior packing and topical antibiotics
(B): Oxymetazoline nasal spray
(C): Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril
(D): Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels
(E): Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated
",Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Squeezing the nostrils manually for 10 minutes with the head elevated.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the most appropriate initial therapy for the persistent nosebleed is to manually squeeze the nostrils for 10 minutes with the head elevated. This technique, known as direct pressure, is the first-line treatment for epistaxis (nosebleeds). It helps to compress the bleeding vessel and promote clot formation, ultimately stopping the bleeding. The patient should be instructed to lean forward slightly to prevent blood from flowing down the throat and to avoid swallowing blood. This technique is effective in the majority of cases and is safe and easy to perform. 

Anterior packing and topical antibiotics (Option A) may be considered if direct pressure fails to control the bleeding. However, it is not the most appropriate initial therapy in this case.

Oxymetazoline nasal spray (Option B) is a vasoconstrictor that can help reduce bleeding by constricting blood vessels in the nose. While it may be used as an adjunctive therapy, it is not the most appropriate initial therapy in this case.

Placement of an epinephrine gauze in the left nostril (Option C) is not the most appropriate initial therapy. Epinephrine is a vasoconstrictor that can help reduce bleeding, but it is typically used in more severe cases or when other measures have failed.

Silver nitrate cauterization of the bleeding vessel and surrounding vessels (Option D) is a treatment option for recurrent or persistent nosebleeds. However, it is not the most appropriate initial therapy in this case.",
"A 40-year-old female presents to your office complaining of a tender neck and general lethargy. Upon further questioning, she reports decreased appetite, fatigue, constipation, and jaw pain. Her pulse is 60 bpm and her blood pressure is 130/110 mm Hg. Biopsy of her thyroid reveals granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells surrounding fragmented colloid. Which of the following likely precipitated the patient’s condition:
Options:
(A): Iodine deficiency
(B): Goitrogens
(C): Thryoglossal duct cyst
(D): Infection
(E): Chronic renal disease
",Infection,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Infection.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including tender neck, general lethargy, decreased appetite, fatigue, constipation, and jaw pain, along with the findings on biopsy of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells surrounding fragmented colloid, are consistent with subacute granulomatous thyroiditis, also known as De Quervain's thyroiditis. This condition is typically caused by a viral infection, most commonly a preceding upper respiratory tract infection. The inflammation in the thyroid gland leads to the release of thyroid hormones, resulting in symptoms such as increased pulse rate and elevated blood pressure. 

Iodine deficiency (A) can lead to goiter and hypothyroidism, but it does not typically present with the symptoms described in the patient. Goitrogens (B) are substances that interfere with thyroid hormone synthesis and can lead to goiter, but they are not associated with the specific findings of granulomatous inflammation and multinucleate giant cells seen in this patient. Thyroglossal duct cyst (C) is a congenital abnormality that presents as a midline neck mass and is not associated with the symptoms and findings described in this patient. Chronic renal disease (E) can lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism and alterations in thyroid hormone metabolism, but it is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms and findings.",
"A 24-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by the police after a fall. The patient smells of alcohol and is slurring his words. You find out that he has recently been fired from his job as a salesperson for months of tardiness and poor performance. The police tell you that his girlfriend, who was there at the time of the fall, mentioned that the patient has been struggling with alcohol for at least a year. Upon physical examination, the patient becomes agitated and starts yelling. He accuses his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and says he couldn’t keep up sales percentages compared to someone using cocaine. Which of the following psychiatric defense mechanisms is the patient demonstrating?
Options:
(A): Denial
(B): Displacement
(C): Projection
(D): Rationalization
(E): Regression
",Projection,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Projection.

Explanation:
Projection is a defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses onto someone else. In this case, the patient is accusing his ex-boss of being a cocaine addict and implying that his poor performance was due to someone else using cocaine. This is a way for the patient to avoid taking responsibility for his own actions and substance abuse issues by projecting them onto someone else. The patient is displacing his own feelings of inadequacy and failure onto his ex-boss.",
"A 65-year-old woman presents to a physician with painful ankles for 2 days. Her symptoms began 1 week ago with a severe fever (40℃ (104℉)) for 3 days. When the fever subsided, she developed a maculopapular rash over the trunk and extremities with painful wrists and fingers. She also reports abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and headaches. Last week she returned from a trip to Africa where she spent several weeks, mostly in rural areas. Her temperature is 37.5℃ (99.5℉); pulse is 75/min; respiratory rate is 13/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. A maculopapular rash is observed over the trunk and limbs. Both ankles are swollen and painful to active and passive motion. The abdomen is soft without organomegaly. Laboratory studies show the following:
Laboratory test
Hemoglobin 11.4 g/d
Mean corpuscular volume 90 µm3
Leukocyte count 4,500/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 70%
Lymphocytes 15%
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Ring-form trophozoites are absent on the peripheral blood smear. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this patient’s illness?
Options:
(A): Babesia babesia
(B): Chikungunya virus
(C): Dengue virus
(D): Leishmania major
(E): Tropheryma whipplei
",Chikungunya virus,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Chikungunya virus.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and travel history, the most likely cause of her illness is Chikungunya virus infection. Chikungunya virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and is commonly found in tropical and subtropical regions, including Africa. The clinical features of Chikungunya virus infection include fever, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), malaise, headache, and pruritus (itching). The maculopapular rash typically starts on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. Joint involvement is common, with the ankles, fingers, wrists, and knees being most commonly affected. 

In this case, the patient presented with a severe fever followed by a maculopapular rash and painful wrists and fingers. The swollen and painful ankles further support the diagnosis of Chikungunya virus infection. The absence of ring-form trophozoites on the peripheral blood smear rules out Babesia babesia as the cause. The other options, Dengue virus, Leishmania major, and Tropheryma whipplei, do not typically present with the combination of symptoms described in the patient. 

Diagnosis of Chikungunya virus infection can be confirmed by detecting haemagglutinin inhibition and IgM antibodies, which are usually present by the eighth day of illness. Treatment is supportive, focusing on relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Prevention involves avoiding mosquito bites through the use of insect repellents and protective clothing.",
"A 61-year-old man complaining of unexplained bleeding by from the mouth is escorted to the emergency department by corrections officers. Upon examination patient states he feels nauseated as he begins to retch violently and vomit bright red blood. His past medical history is remarkable for cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse and untreated hepatitis C. His current blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 128/min, and oxygen saturation in room air is 88%. On further questioning, he states that he is scared to die and wants everything done to save his life. IV fluids are initiated and packed RBCs are ordered. You begin to review his labs and notice and he has elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate, ammonia, and lactate. What would be the appropriate response to the patient?
Options:
(A): Consult an ethics committee to determine whether to resuscitate the patient
(B): Do not intubate the patient since he does not have written request to be resuscitated
(C): Accept the patient's wishes and appoint and get a psych evaluation.
(D): Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.
(E): Obtain an emergency order from a judge to initiate resuscitation.
",Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is experiencing life-threatening bleeding and has expressed his desire to have everything done to save his life. As a medical professional, it is important to respect the patient's autonomy and honor his wishes. Therefore, the appropriate response would be to accept the patient's wishes and ensure he receives appropriate care.

Consulting an ethics committee (option A) may not be necessary in this situation as the patient has clearly expressed his wishes. Additionally, there is no indication that the patient lacks decision-making capacity.

Withholding intubation (option B) based on the absence of a written request would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient is experiencing a life-threatening emergency.

Appointing a psych evaluation (option C) may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's wishes are clear and he is experiencing a medical emergency.

Obtaining an emergency order from a judge (option E) to initiate resuscitation would not be necessary, as the patient has already expressed his desire to be resuscitated.",
"Three days after undergoing a laparoscopic Whipple's procedure, a 43-year-old woman has swelling of her right leg. She does not have pain. She has nausea but has not vomited. She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer 1 month ago. She has been using an incentive spirometer every 6 hours since recovering from her surgery. Prior to admission, her only medications were a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 118/78 mm Hg. Examination shows mild swelling of the right thigh to the ankle; there is no erythema or pitting edema. Homan's sign is negative. The abdomen is soft and shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. There are five abdominal laparoscopic incisions with no erythema or discharge. The lungs are clear to auscultation. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): CT pulmonary angiography
(B): Compression ultrasonography
(C): Vancomycin therapy
(D): D-dimer level
(E): 2 sets of blood cultures
""
",Compression ultrasonography,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Compression ultrasonography.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is concerning for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a known complication after surgery. The risk factors for DVT in this patient include recent surgery, cancer, and immobility. The swelling of the right leg, absence of pain, and negative Homan's sign are consistent with DVT. Compression ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of DVT. This noninvasive test has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting DVT and is the recommended initial imaging modality for evaluating suspected DVT. CT pulmonary angiography (A) is used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism, which is a complication of DVT, but it is not the most appropriate initial test in this patient. Vancomycin therapy (C) is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of infection. D-dimer level (D) is a nonspecific test that can be used to rule out DVT in patients with low pretest probability, but it is not the most appropriate initial test in this patient. 2 sets of blood cultures (E) are not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of infection.",
"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity. If taken in high doses, which of the following are the most likely side effects of the drug?
Options:
(A): Headache and tinnitus
(B): Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits
(C): Dyslipidemia and hypoglycemia unawareness
(D): Pedal edema and flushing
(E): Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity
",Headache and tinnitus,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Headache and tinnitus.

Explanation:
The class I anti-arrhythmic drug described in the scenario is most likely procainamide, which is a sodium channel blocker. Procainamide is known to have several side effects when taken in high doses. These side effects include headache and tinnitus, which are the most likely side effects mentioned in option (A). 

Procainamide can also cause other side effects such as drowsiness, delirium, hallucinations, low-output cardiac failure, and cardiorespiratory arrest (asystole or ventricular fibrillation). However, these side effects are not mentioned in the options provided.

Pulmonary fibrosis and corneal deposits (option B) are not associated with the use of procainamide. Dyslipidemia and hypoglycemia unawareness (option C) are not known side effects of procainamide. Pedal edema and flushing (option D) are not commonly associated with the use of procainamide. Hypothyroidism and phototoxicity (option E) are also not known side effects of procainamide.",
"A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for recurrent vomiting that began 5 hours ago. He describes the vomitus as bloody and containing black specks. He drinks 10–12 beers daily and has not seen a physician in 15 years. He appears pale. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 122/min, and blood pressure is 85/59 mm Hg. Physical examination shows decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill, multiple spider angiomata, and a distended abdomen. He is oriented to person but not to place or time. Which of the following is most likely decreased in this patient in response to his current condition compared to a healthy adult?
Options:
(A): Systemic vascular resistance
(B): Fractional tissue oxygen extraction
(C): Carotid baroreceptor firing activity
(D): Pulmonary vascular resistance
(E): Cardiac inotropy
",Carotid baroreceptor firing activity,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Carotid baroreceptor firing activity.

Explanation:
In this patient, the most likely decreased response compared to a healthy adult is carotid baroreceptor firing activity. Carotid baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the carotid sinus and are responsible for sensing changes in blood pressure. When blood pressure decreases, these receptors are activated and send signals to the brain to increase sympathetic outflow and decrease parasympathetic outflow, resulting in vasoconstriction and increased heart rate. 

In this patient, the decreased carotid baroreceptor firing activity is likely due to hypovolemia and hypotension caused by recurrent vomiting and alcohol abuse. The decreased blood pressure and signs of hypovolemia (pale appearance, decreased radial pulses, delayed capillary refill) suggest that the patient is in a state of shock. In shock, the body's compensatory mechanisms, including the activation of baroreceptors, are impaired. 

The other options are less likely to be decreased in this patient's current condition. Systemic vascular resistance (A) is typically increased in response to hypovolemia and shock. Capillary fluid absorption (B) is not directly affected by the patient's condition. Fractional tissue oxygen extraction (B) is typically increased in response to hypoxia, not decreased. Pulmonary vascular resistance (D) is not directly affected by the patient's condition. Cardiac inotropy (E) refers to the contractility of the heart, which is not specifically mentioned in the patient's presentation.",
"A 69-year-old male with a longstanding history of hypertension and high cholesterol presents with abdominal pain and ‘bruising on his feet’. The patient states that his symptoms started about a week ago and have steadily worsened. He describes the abdominal pain as mild to moderate, dull, and deeply localized to the umbilical region. Past medical history is significant for 2 transient ischemic attacks 6 months prior, characterized by a sudden right-sided weakness and trouble speaking but recovered fully within 30 minutes. Current medications are sildenafil 100 mg orally as needed. Patient reports a 30-pack-year smoking history and heavy alcohol use on the weekends. Review of systems is significant for decreased appetite and feeling easily full. Vitals are temperature 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 155/89 mm Hg, pulse 89/min, respirations 16/min, and oxygen saturation 98% on room air. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The cardiac exam is normal. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Carotid bruit present on the right. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Bowel sounds present. A pulsatile abdominal mass is felt in the lower umbilical region. Patient’s feet have the following appearance seen in the picture. Abdominal ultrasound reveals the presence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Contrast CT reveals a small, unruptured AAA (diameter 4.1 cm). High flow supplemental oxygen and fluid resuscitation are initiated. Morphine sulfate and metoprolol are administered. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this patient?
 
Options:
(A): Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual ultrasound
(B): Discharge with clinical surveillance and ultrasound every 6 months
(C): Elective endovascular repair
(D): Elective open surgical repair
(E): Emergency open surgical repair
",Emergency open surgical repair,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Emergency open surgical repair.

Explanation:
This patient presents with a pulsatile abdominal mass, abdominal pain, and signs of peripheral embolization (bruising on the feet). These findings are consistent with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) that is at risk for rupture. The patient's symptoms have been worsening over the past week, indicating an acute process. The size of the AAA (4.1 cm) is above the threshold for elective repair (>5.5 cm), but the presence of symptoms and signs of impending rupture necessitate emergency surgical intervention. The patient should undergo immediate open surgical repair to prevent rupture and its potentially catastrophic consequences. Discharge with clinical surveillance and annual or semi-annual ultrasound would not be appropriate in this case, as the risk of rupture is high. Elective endovascular repair or elective open surgical repair would not be appropriate given the patient's acute symptoms and signs of impending rupture.",
"A 38-year-old woman undergoes a partial thyroidectomy for an enlarged thyroid gland compressing the trachea. During surgery, a young surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries as close to the poles as possible to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. 2 weeks later, the patient presents to the outpatient clinic with hoarseness. What could be the most likely cause of her hoarseness?
Options:
(A): Internal laryngeal nerve injury
(B): Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury
(C): Phrenic nerve damage
(D): External laryngeal nerve injury
(E): Laryngeal edema
",Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.

Explanation:
During a partial thyroidectomy, the surgeon ligates the inferior thyroid arteries to prevent intraoperative hemorrhage. However, this procedure carries the risk of injuring the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is located close to the inferior thyroid arteries. The recurrent laryngeal nerve innervates the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, including the vocal cords. Injury to this nerve can result in hoarseness, as the affected vocal cord becomes paretic or paralyzed. In this case, the patient's hoarseness 2 weeks after surgery is likely due to a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.",
"A 17-year-old man presents to his family physician for an evaluation about the size of his penis. He feels increasingly anxious during physical education (PE) class as he has noticed that the size of his penis is significantly smaller when compared to his peers. Based on the physical examination, he is Tanner stage 1. The weight and height are 60 kg (132 lb) and 175 cm (5 ft 9 in), respectively. The cardiopulmonary examination is normal; however, the patient has difficulty identifying coffee grounds by smell. Which of the following explains the pathophysiology underlying this patient’s disorder?
Options:
(A): Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat
(B): Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency
(C): Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting
(D): Leptin receptor mutation
(E): Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes
",Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is 17 years old and in Tanner stage 1, which indicates a lack of pubertal development. This suggests a deficiency in the hormones responsible for initiating puberty. The patient's difficulty in identifying coffee grounds by smell is a characteristic finding in patients with isolated GnRH deficiency.

Isolated GnRH deficiency is a disorder characterized by a failure of the hypothalamus to produce or release GnRH, which is necessary for the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary gland. Without the release of LH and FSH, the testes do not receive the necessary signals to produce testosterone and initiate pubertal development.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat (option A) is seen in certain genetic disorders, such as myotonic dystrophy, but it does not explain the patient's symptoms. Sex-specific epigenetic imprinting (option C) refers to the differential expression of genes based on the sex of the parent from which they are inherited, and it is not relevant to this patient's presentation. A leptin receptor mutation (option D) would result in abnormalities in appetite regulation and energy balance, but it would not explain the patient's lack of pubertal development. Non-disjunction of sex chromosomes (option E) would result in chromosomal abnormalities, such as Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) or Turner syndrome (45,X), but these conditions typically present with more significant abnormalities in sexual development.",
"A 63-year-old man is aiming to improve his health by eating a well balanced diet, walking daily, and quitting smoking following a 45-year smoking history. While on his daily walks he notices a strong cramping pain in his calves that consistently appears after a mile of walking. He sees his physician and a diagnosis of peripheral artery disease with intermittent claudication is made. To improve his symptoms, cilostazol is prescribed. What is the mechanism of action of this medication?
Options:
(A): Irreversible cyclooxygenase inhibitor
(B): Glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitor
(C): Thromboxane synthase inhibitor
(D): Adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor
(E): Phosphodiesterase inhibitor
",Phosphodiesterase inhibitor,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Phosphodiesterase inhibitor.

Explanation:
Cilostazol is a medication that is used to improve the symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease. It works by inhibiting phosphodiesterase, an enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). By inhibiting phosphodiesterase, cilostazol increases the levels of cAMP in platelets and blood vessels, leading to vasodilation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. This helps to improve blood flow and relieve the symptoms of intermittent claudication.",
"A 37-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the chief complaint of a high fever for several days. In addition to the fever, he has had malaise, chest pain, and a dry cough. He recently went on vacation to South America but has returned to his job delivering packages. He has several friends who recently had influenza. Hi temperature is 102.8°F (39.3 °C), blood pressure is 137/80 mmHg, pulse is 104/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98%. Chest exam reveals a deep noise found bilaterally in the lung bases. Chest radiograph reveals a wider area of opacity near the heart and bilateral lung infiltrates. Which of the following is characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Captain's wheel appearance
(B): Cultured on charcoal and yeast
(C): D-glutamate capsule
(D): Found in desert sand
(E): Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule
",D-glutamate capsule,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) D-glutamate capsule.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including high fever, malaise, chest pain, and a dry cough, along with the findings on chest exam and radiograph, are consistent with pneumonia. The wider area of opacity near the heart and bilateral lung infiltrates suggest a bacterial etiology.

The characteristic of the most likely organism responsible for this patient's symptoms is the presence of a D-glutamate capsule. This is a characteristic feature of Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. The D-glutamate capsule is responsible for the virulence of the bacteria and helps protect it from phagocytosis by the host's immune cells.

The other options are not associated with Bacillus anthracis or the symptoms described in the patient. 

(A) Captain's wheel appearance is seen in Legionella pneumophila, which causes Legionnaires' disease, but this is not the most likely organism in this case.

(B) Cultured on charcoal and yeast is a characteristic of Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, but this is not the most likely organism in this case.

(D) Found in desert sand is a characteristic of Coccidioides immitis, the causative agent of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever), but this is not the most likely organism in this case.

(E) Polyribosyl-ribitol-phosphate capsule is a characteristic of Haemophilus influenzae type b, but this is not the most likely organism in this case.",
"A 34-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of headache, fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain for the past 4 days. He smokes 2 packs per day and drinks 2–3 beers every day. He denies any previous medical problems except for seasonal allergies for which he takes diphenhydramine on occasions. At the hospital, the vital signs include: temperature 40.0°C (104.0°F), blood pressure 140/80 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 28/min. On physical exam, he is thin and poorly kept. His clothes appear dirty. Small scars are visible in the decubitus region of both arms. The lung sounds are equal with bilateral crackles, and heart auscultation reveals a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla. Petechiae are seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands. A chest X-ray and blood cultures are ordered. What is the most likely organism causing his symptoms?
Options:
(A): Streptococci viridans
(B): Enterococci
(C): Staphylococcus aureus
(D): Aspergillus fumigatus
(E): Staphylococcus epidermidis
",Staphylococcus aureus,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Staphylococcus aureus.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely organism causing his symptoms is Staphylococcus aureus. The patient presents with fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain, which are consistent with a respiratory infection. The presence of crackles on lung auscultation suggests pneumonia. Additionally, the patient has a systolic murmur that radiates to the left axilla, which is indicative of infective endocarditis. The petechiae seen on the hard palate and palms of his hands are also suggestive of infective endocarditis.

Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of both pneumonia and infective endocarditis. It is a gram-positive bacterium that can cause a wide range of infections, including skin and soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, and bloodstream infections. In this case, the patient's history of poor hygiene, smoking, and alcohol use may have increased his risk of acquiring a Staphylococcus aureus infection.

The other options listed (Streptococci viridans, Enterococci, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) are less likely to be the causative organism in this case. Streptococci viridans and Enterococci are more commonly associated with infective endocarditis in patients with underlying heart conditions or dental procedures. Aspergillus fumigatus is a fungus that can cause invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's clinical presentation. Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common skin commensal and is not typically associated with severe infections like pneumonia or infective endocarditis.",
"A 42-year-old man presents to a neurologist for evaluation of severe headache. He started experiencing episodic headaches and palpitations 3 months ago; however, he thought that these symptoms were simply related to the stress of moving and starting a new job. He has continued to experience these intermittent headaches and has also noticed that he sweats profusely during these episodes. On presentation his temperature is 99.1°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 163/112 mmHg, pulse is 112/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals pallor and perspiration but is otherwise unremarkable. The most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is produced by cells located in which region of the histology slide shown in figure A?
Options:
(A): A
(B): B
(C): C
(D): D
(E): E
",E,Correct,"The correct choice is (E).

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of severe headache, palpitations, profuse sweating, and elevated blood pressure, along with the physical exam findings of pallor and perspiration, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, which is located in region E of the histology slide. These tumors secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine, leading to symptoms such as headache, palpitations, sweating, and hypertension. The elevated blood pressure and tachycardia seen in this patient are consistent with the effects of excess catecholamine release. Therefore, the cells located in region E of the histology slide are most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms.",
"A 62-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for vision changes. About 90 minutes ago she was on the couch watching television with her husband when she suddenly noticed that she couldn't see the screen normally. She also felt a little dizzy. She has never had anything like this happen before. Her general physical exam is unremarkable. Her neurologic exam is notable for loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, though extraocular movements are intact. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head shows no acute intracranial process. Angiography of the brain will most likely show a lesion in which of the following vessels?
Options:
(A): Internal carotid artery
(B): Anterior cerebral artery
(C): Middle cerebral artery
(D): Posterior cerebral artery
(E): Basilar artery
",Posterior cerebral artery,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Posterior cerebral artery.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of sudden vision changes, specifically loss of vision in the right visual field of both eyes with macular sparing, are consistent with a lesion in the posterior cerebral artery (PCA). The PCA supplies the occipital lobe, which is responsible for processing visual information. A lesion in the PCA can result in visual field defects, such as homonymous hemianopia (loss of vision in one half of the visual field) with macular sparing (preservation of central vision). 

The other options are less likely to be involved in this patient's symptoms. The internal carotid artery supplies blood to the anterior circulation of the brain, including the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Lesions in these vessels would typically result in different patterns of neurologic deficits, such as weakness or sensory loss in the contralateral limbs. The basilar artery supplies the brainstem and cerebellum, and lesions in this artery would typically result in more widespread neurologic deficits. The anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior portion of the spinal cord, and lesions in this artery would result in spinal cord ischemia and neurologic deficits below the level of the lesion.",
"A three-day-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her son's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day, but sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding the infant but feels the latch has been poor and is unsure how much milk he has been consuming but feels it is not enough. A lactation consult was called for the patient and it was noted that despite proper instruction the observed latch was still poor. When asked the mother stated that the baby is currently making stools 2 times per day. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): Breast milk jaundice
(B): Breastfeeding jaundice
(C): Sepsis
(D): Crigler-Najjar syndrome
(E): Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia
",Breastfeeding jaundice,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Breastfeeding jaundice.

Breastfeeding jaundice is the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation. Breastfeeding jaundice occurs when a baby does not get enough breast milk due to difficulty feeding or the mother not producing enough milk. This can lead to weight loss in the baby and increased levels of bilirubin, resulting in jaundice. In this case, the mother reports a poor latch and uncertainty about the amount of milk the baby is consuming, suggesting inadequate milk intake.

Breast milk jaundice, another option, is caused by a baby's immature liver and intestines, resulting in slower removal of bilirubin. However, breast milk jaundice typically occurs in the second week of life, while the patient in this case is only three days old.

Sepsis, option (C), is unlikely in this case as there are no other signs or symptoms of infection mentioned in the scenario.

Crigler-Najjar syndrome, option (D), is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin. This results in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not the case in this patient.

Physiologic hyperbilirubinemia, option (E), is a normal process in newborns due to the breakdown of red blood cells and the immaturity of the liver. However, in this case, the inadequate milk intake is the more likely cause of the jaundice.

Therefore, the most likely etiology of the patient's presentation is breastfeeding jaundice.",
"A 59-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with a history of black, tarry stools but denies vomiting of blood or abdominal pain. His family has noticed progressive confusion. History is significant for liver cirrhosis and alcoholism. His heart rate is 112/min, temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, he is jaundiced, lethargic, is oriented to person and place but not date, and has moderate ascites. Neurological examination reveals asterixis, and his stool is guaiac-positive. Liver function test are shown below:
Total albumin 2 g/dL
Prothrombin time 9 seconds
Total bilirubin 5 mg/dL
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 100 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 220 U/L
Which of the following is a feature of this patient condition?
Options:
(A): It carries a good prognosis
(B): Ammonia level is the best initial test to confirm the diagnosis
(C): It is a diagnosis of exclusion
(D): It only occurs in patients with cirrhosis
(E): Electroencephalography (EEG) usually shows focal localising abnormality
",It is a diagnosis of exclusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): It is a diagnosis of exclusion.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with alcoholic hepatitis, which is characterized by liver inflammation and hepatocellular injury due to chronic alcohol consumption. Alcoholic hepatitis is diagnosed based on clinical features, laboratory findings, and exclusion of other causes of liver disease.

In this case, the patient has a history of liver cirrhosis and alcoholism, which are risk factors for alcoholic hepatitis. The presence of jaundice, lethargy, asterixis, and guaiac-positive stools further support the diagnosis. The liver function tests show elevated levels of AST and ALT, indicating hepatocellular injury. The low albumin level and prolonged prothrombin time suggest impaired synthetic liver function.

However, the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that other causes of liver disease should be ruled out before making the diagnosis. This is because other conditions, such as viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, can also cause similar clinical and laboratory findings.

Therefore, it is important to perform additional tests, such as viral hepatitis serologies, screening for other liver diseases, and imaging studies, to exclude other potential causes of liver disease and confirm the diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis.",
"A 20-year-old healthy man is running on a treadmill for the last 30 minutes. He is in good shape and exercises 3 times per week. He takes no medications and denies smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and illicit drug use. Prior to starting his run, his heart rate was 70/min, and the blood pressure was 114/74 mm Hg. Immediately after stopping his run, the heart rate is 130/min, and the blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the change in his heart rate and blood pressure?
Options:
(A): Baroreceptor reflex
(B): Increased activation of the vagal nuclei
(C): Increased aldosterone production
(D): Sympathetic nervous system activation
(E): Vasopressin release from the pituitary
",Sympathetic nervous system activation,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Sympathetic nervous system activation.

Explanation:
During exercise, the body's demand for oxygen and nutrients increases, leading to an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the body's ""fight or flight"" response and is activated during exercise to increase heart rate and blood pressure.

The baroreceptor reflex, option (A), is a negative feedback mechanism that helps regulate blood pressure by sensing changes in pressure and adjusting heart rate and blood vessel diameter accordingly. However, in this scenario, the increase in heart rate and blood pressure is a normal response to exercise and not due to a baroreceptor reflex.

Increased activation of the vagal nuclei, option (B), would result in a decrease in heart rate, not an increase. The vagus nerve, which is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, slows down the heart rate.

Increased aldosterone production, option (C), is not directly involved in regulating heart rate and blood pressure. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands that helps regulate sodium and potassium levels in the body.

Vasopressin release from the pituitary, option (E), is involved in regulating water balance and blood volume, but it does not directly affect heart rate and blood pressure during exercise.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the change in heart rate and blood pressure after exercise is sympathetic nervous system activation, option (D).",
"A 14-year-old obese boy presents with severe right hip and knee pain. The patient says that he has been limping with mild pain for the past three weeks, but the pain acutely worsened today. He describes the pain as severe, non-radiating, sharp and aching in character, and localized to the right hip and knee joints. The patient denies recent illness, travel, trauma, or similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history and no current medications. The patient is not sexually active and denies any alcohol, smoking or drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 110/70 mm Hg, pulse 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. Body mass index (BMI) is 32 kg/m2. On physical examination, the patient is alert and cooperative. The right leg is externally rotated, and there is a limited range of motion in the right hip. Strength is 4 out of 5 at the right hip joint and 5 out of 5 elsewhere. There is no tenderness to palpation. No joint erythema, edema or effusion present. Sensation is intact. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the right hip joint are significant for displacement of the right femoral head inferoposterior off the femoral neck. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Reassess in 3 months
(B): Immobilize the right knee with conservative treatment (i.e. rest, ice)
(C): Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint
(D): Pavlik harness
(E): Surgical pinning of the right hip
",Surgical pinning of the right hip,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Surgical pinning of the right hip.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, this patient most likely has slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is a common hip disorder in adolescents. SCFE occurs when the femoral head slips off the femoral neck, leading to hip and knee pain, limited range of motion, and an externally rotated leg. It is more common in obese individuals and can be associated with endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism.

SCFE is a surgical emergency, and prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent further displacement and complications such as avascular necrosis of the femoral head. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is surgical pinning of the right hip, which involves stabilizing the femoral head back onto the femoral neck using pins or screws. This procedure helps to prevent further slippage and allows for proper healing of the hip joint.

Reassessing in 3 months (option A) is not appropriate for SCFE, as it is a progressive condition that requires immediate intervention. Immobilizing the right knee with conservative treatment (option B) may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but it does not address the underlying problem of the slipped femoral head. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection of the right hip joint (option C) is not indicated for SCFE. The Pavlik harness (option D) is used for the treatment of developmental dysplasia of the hip, not SCFE.",
"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a progressive development of tender breast tissue over the past 18 months. He used to ride his bicycle for exercise 4 times a week but stopped after he had an accident and injured his left testicle 3 months ago. He has gained 5 kg (11 lb) during this period. For the last 10 years, he drinks one to two beers daily and sometimes more on weekends. He occasionally takes pantoprazole for heartburn. He is 171 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 87 kg (192 lb); BMI is 30 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows bilaterally symmetrical, mildly tender gynecomastia. A nontender 1.5-cm mass is palpated in the left testis; transillumination test is negative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?
Options:
(A): Leydig cell tumor
(B): Obesity
(C): Thyroid disease
(D): Klinefelter syndrome
(E): Trauma to testis
",Leydig cell tumor,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Leydig cell tumor.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of gynecomastia, which is the development of breast tissue in males. The presence of a nontender testicular mass further supports the diagnosis of gynecomastia due to a Leydig cell tumor.

Leydig cell tumors are rare testicular tumors that can produce estrogen, leading to gynecomastia. These tumors are usually benign and present as a painless testicular mass. In this case, the patient has a nontender 1.5-cm mass in the left testis, which is consistent with a Leydig cell tumor.

Obesity (B) can also be associated with gynecomastia due to increased conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue. However, the presence of a testicular mass makes Leydig cell tumor a more likely cause in this patient.

Thyroid disease (C) can cause gynecomastia due to alterations in the balance of estrogen and testosterone levels. However, there are no other symptoms or signs of hyperthyroidism mentioned in the patient's history.

Klinefelter syndrome (D) is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of an extra X chromosome (47,XXY). It can cause gynecomastia, but it typically presents during adolescence and is associated with other features such as small testicles, sparse facial hair, and decreased libido. The patient's age and lack of other characteristic features make Klinefelter syndrome less likely.

Trauma to the testis (E) can cause testicular injury but is not a common cause of gynecomastia. Additionally, the presence of a testicular mass suggests a different etiology.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of these findings is a Leydig cell tumor (A).",
"A 58-year-old man comes to the physician because he is unable to achieve erections during sexual intercourse. He first noticed the problem 8 months ago, when he became sexually active with a new girlfriend. He states that his relationship with his girlfriend is good, but his inability to engage in sexual intercourse has been frustrating. He has hyperlipidemia and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago. He works as a lawyer and enjoys his job, but he has had a great deal of stress lately. He had not been sexually active for the previous 3 years, since the death of his wife. He does not smoke. He drinks 4–6 beers on weekends. Current medications include simvastatin and citalopram. His temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 135/82 mm Hg. BMI is 30 kg/m2. Pedal pulses are difficult to palpate. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Psychotherapy
(B): Penile prosthesis insertion
(C): Intracavernous prostaglandin E1 injections
(D): Nocturnal penile tumescence testing
(E): Switch citalopram to bupropion
",Nocturnal penile tumescence testing,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Nocturnal penile tumescence testing.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of organic erectile dysfunction (ED). Organic ED is characterized by the inability to achieve or maintain an erection due to physical factors, such as vascular insufficiency or nerve damage. In this case, the patient has multiple risk factors for vascular insufficiency, including hyperlipidemia, obesity (BMI of 30 kg/m2), and difficulty palpating pedal pulses. Additionally, his use of simvastatin suggests that he may have underlying cardiovascular disease.

Nocturnal penile tumescence testing is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Nocturnal penile tumescence refers to spontaneous erections that occur during sleep, which are a normal physiological response. This testing can help differentiate between psychogenic and organic causes of ED. If the patient has normal nocturnal penile tumescence, it suggests that his ED is likely due to psychogenic factors, such as anxiety or depression. On the other hand, if the patient does not have normal nocturnal penile tumescence, it suggests that his ED is likely due to organic factors, such as vascular insufficiency.

Psychotherapy (option A) may be considered if the patient's ED is determined to be primarily psychogenic. However, given the patient's risk factors for vascular insufficiency and the absence of nocturnal penile tumescence, further evaluation is needed before initiating psychotherapy.

Penile prosthesis insertion (option B) and intracavernous prostaglandin E1 injections (option C) are invasive treatment options for ED and are typically reserved for patients who have failed or are not candidates for less invasive treatments. These options are not appropriate as initial management in this patient.

Switching citalopram to bupropion (option E) may be considered if the patient's ED is thought to be related to medication side effects. However, given the patient's risk factors for vascular insufficiency and the absence of nocturnal penile tumescence, further evaluation is needed before considering a medication change.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to perform nocturnal penile tumescence testing to help determine the underlying cause of his ED.",
"A 5-year-old male presents to the pediatrician with a 10-day history of cough that is worse at night. The patient has a history of mild intermittent asthma and has been using his albuterol inhaler without relief. He has also been complaining of headache and sore throat, and his mother has noticed worsening rhinorrhea. The patient’s past medical history is otherwise unremarkable, and he has no known drug allergies. In the office, his temperature is 101.8°F (38.8°C), blood pressure is 88/65 mmHg, pulse is 132/min, and respirations are 16/min. The patient has purulent mucus draining from the nares, and his face is tender to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. His pharynx is erythematous with symmetric swelling of the tonsils. On lung exam, he has moderate bilateral expiratory wheezing.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Amoxicillin
(B): Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid
(C): Ampicillin-sulbactam
(D): Clindamycin
(E): Levofloxacin
",Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute sinusitis with associated exacerbation of asthma. The patient has a history of mild intermittent asthma and is currently experiencing worsening cough, wheezing, and shortness of breath. Additionally, he has symptoms consistent with sinusitis, including headache, sore throat, worsening rhinorrhea, and purulent nasal discharge. The presence of tender maxillary sinuses and erythematous tonsils further supports the diagnosis of sinusitis.

The recommended treatment for acute sinusitis in children is amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. This combination antibiotic is effective against the most common pathogens responsible for sinusitis, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Amoxicillin alone may be used in mild cases, but the addition of clavulanic acid helps to cover beta-lactamase-producing organisms, which are becoming increasingly common.

Options (A) Amoxicillin, (C) Ampicillin-sulbactam, (D) Clindamycin, and (E) Levofloxacin are not the best choices for initial treatment in this case. Amoxicillin alone may not provide adequate coverage against beta-lactamase-producing organisms. Ampicillin-sulbactam is not typically used as first-line therapy for sinusitis in children. Clindamycin and levofloxacin are reserved for cases of severe or complicated sinusitis, or when the patient has a known allergy to penicillin-based antibiotics.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is to prescribe amoxicillin-clavulanic acid.",
"A 65-year-old man, known to have chronic obstructive lung disease for the last 3 years, presents to the emergency department with a cough, breathing difficulty, and increased expectoration for a day. There is no history of fever. His regular medications include inhaled salmeterol and inhaled fluticasone propionate. He was a chronic smoker but quit smoking 2 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), the pulse rate is 88/min, the blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg, and the respirations are 30/min. On physical examination, the use of the accessory muscles of respiration is evident and the arterial saturation of oxygen is 87%. Auscultation of the chest reveals the presence of bilateral rhonchi with diminished breath sounds in both lungs. Which of the following medications, if administered for the next 2 weeks, is most likely to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months?
Options:
(A): Oral theophylline
(B): Oral prednisone
(C): Supplemental oxygen
(D): Montelukast
(E): Nebulized N-acetylcysteine
",Oral prednisone,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Oral prednisone.

Explanation:
In this patient with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) presenting with an acute exacerbation, the most appropriate medication to reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations over the next 6 months is oral prednisone. Oral prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of exacerbations in patients with COPD. It has anti-inflammatory effects and can help to decrease airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. In this patient, the presence of bilateral rhonchi and diminished breath sounds on physical examination suggests airway obstruction, which can be improved with the use of systemic corticosteroids like prednisone. The patient's use of accessory muscles of respiration and low arterial saturation of oxygen also indicate significant respiratory distress and the need for systemic treatment. Oral theophylline (choice A) is a bronchodilator that can be used in the management of stable COPD, but it is not the most appropriate choice for an acute exacerbation. Supplemental oxygen (choice C) is important in the management of COPD exacerbations to maintain oxygen saturation above 90%, but it does not directly reduce the risk of subsequent exacerbations. Montelukast (choice D) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is used in the management of asthma, but it is not typically used in the treatment of COPD exacerbations. Nebulized N-acetylcysteine (choice E) is a mucolytic agent that can help to reduce sputum viscosity, but it is not the most appropriate choice for an acute exacerbation.",
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department for abdominal pain. The patient has been trying to get pregnant and was successful recently, but now she is experiencing abdominal pain, contractions, and a bloody vaginal discharge. According to her last appointment with her primary care provider, she is 10 weeks pregnant. The patient has a past medical history of constipation, anxiety, and substance abuse. She is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a bloody vaginal discharge and an open cervix. The patient is initially extremely grateful for the care she is receiving and thanks the doctor and the nursing staff for saving her baby. Upon hearing the news that she is having a spontaneous abortion, the patient becomes angry and aggressive and states that her physician and the medical staff are incompetent, evil, and she is going to sue all of them. The patient is left to grieve but upon entering the room again you notice that the patient has new lacerations over her wrists and that some of the medical equipment in the room is broken. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Acute stress response
(B): Antisocial personality disorder
(C): Borderline personality disorder
(D): Normal grief response
(E): Post-traumatic stress disorder
",Borderline personality disorder,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Borderline personality disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's extreme reaction to the news of a spontaneous abortion, including becoming angry, aggressive, and making threats to sue, is indicative of a maladaptive response to stress. This, along with the presence of self-harm behaviors (new lacerations over her wrists) and impulsivity (breaking medical equipment), suggests a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder.

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, as well as marked impulsivity. Individuals with this disorder often have intense and unstable relationships, fear of abandonment, and difficulty regulating their emotions. They may engage in self-harming behaviors, such as cutting or burning themselves, as a way to cope with emotional distress.

In this case, the patient's intense reaction to the news of the spontaneous abortion, coupled with her aggressive behavior and self-harm, is consistent with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. It is important to provide appropriate support and referral for mental health services to address the patient's emotional and psychological needs.",
"A 45-year-old female presents to the emergency department with gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain. She denies any previous episodes of hematuria. She reports taking high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin over several weeks due to persistent upper back pain. The patient’s blood pressure and temperature are normal, but she is found to have proteinuria. Physical examination is negative for palpable flank masses. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis:
Options:
(A): Diffuse cortical necrosis
(B): Chronic pyelonephritis
(C): Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease
(D): Papillary necrosis
(E): Acute Nephrolithiasis
",Papillary necrosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Papillary necrosis.

Explanation:
Papillary necrosis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Papillary necrosis is a condition characterized by the death of the renal papillae, which are the small, nipple-like projections in the kidney. It is often associated with the use of certain medications, such as high doses of acetaminophen and aspirin, which can cause damage to the renal papillae.

The patient's presentation of gross hematuria and acute, colicky flank pain is consistent with papillary necrosis. The hematuria is a result of the damaged renal papillae, which can lead to bleeding. The flank pain is caused by the obstruction of urine flow due to the necrotic papillae.

The presence of proteinuria in this patient is also indicative of papillary necrosis. Proteinuria is the presence of excess protein in the urine and can be a sign of kidney damage.

The absence of palpable flank masses on physical examination further supports the diagnosis of papillary necrosis. Other conditions, such as renal cell carcinoma or renal stones, may present with flank masses.

Diffuse cortical necrosis (option A) is a condition characterized by widespread death of the renal cortex, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Chronic pyelonephritis (option B) is a chronic infection of the renal pelvis and is not likely to present with acute symptoms such as gross hematuria and colicky flank pain.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (option C) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys. It typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain and hypertension, which are not described in this patient.

Acute nephrolithiasis (option E) refers to the presence of kidney stones and can cause similar symptoms to papillary necrosis, such as flank pain and hematuria. However, the history of high-dose acetaminophen and aspirin use suggests papillary necrosis as the more likely diagnosis in this case.",
"A 40-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of increased bilateral pain in his knees. The pain developed over time and now limits his mobility. He states that the pain is worse at the end of the day, though he does have some early-morning stiffness lasting about 20 minutes. He used to have some success with over-the-counter NSAIDs; however, they no longer help. The patient also has been taking metformin for the past 2 years and is severely obese, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2. Additionally, he states that he has felt increasingly tired during the day, often dozes off during work, and no longer feels refreshed when he wakes up in the morning. Upon examination, there is no tenderness on palpation or erythema; however, some crepitus is felt. He has no other complaints but has a family history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) on his mother’s side. Which of the following factors is the underlying cause of the patient’s pain, as well as the rest of his complaints?
Options:
(A): Autoimmune disease
(B): Medication side effect
(C): Excess weight
(D): Infection
(E): Occult malignancy
",Excess weight,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Excess weight.

Explanation:
The patient's severe obesity, with a BMI of 41 kg/m2, is the underlying cause of his pain and other complaints. Excess weight puts increased stress on the joints, particularly the weight-bearing joints such as the knees. This can lead to the development or worsening of osteoarthritis, which is characterized by pain, stiffness, and limited mobility. The pain being worse at the end of the day and the early-morning stiffness are typical symptoms of osteoarthritis. The lack of tenderness on palpation or erythema, as well as the presence of crepitus, further support the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. 

The patient's history of success with over-the-counter NSAIDs in the past suggests that the pain is not due to an autoimmune disease like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which typically requires more potent medications for symptom relief. Additionally, there are no other signs or symptoms to suggest an infection or occult malignancy as the cause of the patient's complaints. While metformin can have side effects, it is not typically associated with joint pain or the other symptoms described by the patient. Therefore, excess weight is the most likely cause of the patient's pain and other complaints. Weight loss and lifestyle modifications, such as exercise and dietary changes, should be recommended to help alleviate his symptoms and improve his overall health.",
"A 40-year-old man comes to the physician because of shortness of breath, double vision, and fatigue for the past 4 weeks. He has no history of serious medical illness and takes no medications. Physical examination shows drooping of the eyelids bilaterally. He is unable to hold his arms up for longer than 3 minutes. A CT scan of the chest shows an anterior mediastinal mass with smooth contours. A photomicrograph of a specimen from the mass is shown. Which of the following immunologic processes normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow?
Options:
(A): B-cell maturation
(B): Macrophage activation
(C): V(D)J recombination
(D): Thymocyte formation
(E): Negative selection
",Negative selection,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Negative selection.

Explanation:
The photomicrograph shows an anterior mediastinal mass, which is most likely a thymoma. The clinical presentation of drooping of the eyelids (ptosis), weakness in holding the arms up (proximal muscle weakness), and the presence of a thymoma are consistent with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) at the neuromuscular junction. 

In the thymus, T-cell precursors undergo a process called thymocyte formation, where they differentiate and mature into functional T-cells. During this process, T-cells undergo positive and negative selection. Positive selection allows T-cells with receptors that can recognize self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules to survive, while those that cannot recognize self-MHC molecules undergo apoptosis. Negative selection, on the other hand, eliminates T-cells that have receptors that strongly bind to self-antigens. This process is important for preventing autoimmunity.

In the case of myasthenia gravis, the thymus is abnormal and contains a thymoma. This abnormal thymus can lead to a breakdown in the process of negative selection, allowing autoreactive T-cells to escape elimination. These autoreactive T-cells can then go on to attack the AChR at the neuromuscular junction, leading to the symptoms of MG.

Therefore, the immunologic process that normally occurs in the region indicated by the arrow is negative selection.",
"A 24-year-old man is brought in to the emergency department by his parents who found him in his room barely responsive and with slurring speech. The patients’ parents say that a bottle of oxycodone was found at his bedside and was missing 15 pills. On physical examination, the patient appears drowsy and lethargic and is minimally responsive to stimuli. His respiratory rate is 8/min and shallow, blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg, and pulse is 60/min. On physical examination, miosis is present, and the pupils appear pinpoint. The patient is given a drug to improve his symptoms. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely administered?
Options:
(A): μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist
(B): μ receptor agonist
(C): к receptor agonist and μ receptor antagonist
(D): μ, к, and ẟ receptor agonist
(E): μ receptor partial agonist and к receptor agonist
","μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist",Correct,"The correct choice is (A) μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist.

The patient's symptoms, including drowsiness, respiratory depression, miosis, and decreased responsiveness, are consistent with opioid overdose. Oxycodone, the drug found at the patient's bedside, is a μ-opioid receptor agonist. The drug that was most likely administered to improve the patient's symptoms is a μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist.

Opioid receptors are G protein-coupled receptors located in the central nervous system (CNS), sensory nerve endings, endothelial cells, and throughout the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are three established opioid receptors: μ, κ, and ẟ receptors. Activation of μ receptors is responsible for analgesia, euphoria, and addiction. Activation of κ and ẟ receptors can result in additional effects such as spinal analgesia, respiratory depression, and possible dysphoria.

By administering a μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist, the drug can block the effects of the oxycodone and reverse the symptoms of opioid overdose. This includes reversing respiratory depression, improving consciousness, and reversing miosis.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the drug that was administered is a μ, κ, and ẟ receptor antagonist.",
"A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing shortness of breath and a non-productive cough for 2 months. She has been unable to perform her daily activities. She has had malaise and bilateral ankle pain during this period. She noticed her symptoms after returning from a vacation to Arizona. She is a research assistant at the university geology laboratory. She is originally from Nigeria and visits her family there twice a year; her last trip was 3 months ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 112/72 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is no palpable cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Her left eye is notable for ciliary injection and photophobia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count is within the reference range. An x-ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Sarcoidosis
(B): Pulmonary tuberculosis
(C): Hypersensitivity pneumonitis
(D): Hodgkin's lymphoma
(E): Histoplasmosis
",Sarcoidosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Sarcoidosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and joints. It commonly presents with respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and a non-productive cough. The patient's bilateral ankle pain and malaise are also consistent with sarcoidosis.

The patient's history of travel to Arizona and being a research assistant at a geology laboratory are important clues. Sarcoidosis is more common in certain geographic regions, including the southwestern United States, and exposure to certain environmental factors, such as dust or chemicals, may increase the risk of developing the disease.

The patient's physical examination findings, including ciliary injection and photophobia in the left eye, suggest ocular involvement, which is a common manifestation of sarcoidosis. The absence of palpable lymphadenopathy and clear lung auscultation findings make other diagnoses, such as tuberculosis or lymphoma, less likely.

The chest x-ray may show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is a classic finding in sarcoidosis. However, it is important to note that the chest x-ray alone is not sufficient to make a definitive diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Additional tests, such as pulmonary function tests, bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy, and/or biopsy of involved organs, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms, history, physical examination findings, and chest x-ray, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis.",
"A 75-year-old man presents to his physician with a 1-year history of dysphagia for solids. His more recent complaints include dysphagia for liquids as well. The patient states that he has no difficulty initiating swallowing but occasionally food is stuck in his throat. He does not complain of pain while swallowing but has noticed minor unintentional weight loss. The patient has no history of speech-related pain or nasal regurgitation. His family history is unremarkable. During the examination, the patient appears ill, malnourished, and slightly pale. He is not jaundiced nor cyanotic. Physical examination is unremarkable. A swallowing study reveals a small outpouching in the posterior neck (see image). Which nerve is most likely involved in this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): CN X
(B): CN VII
(C): CN IX
(D): CN V
(E): CN XII
",CN X,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) CN X.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of dysphagia for solids and liquids, occasional food getting stuck in the throat, and unintentional weight loss are suggestive of a swallowing disorder. The presence of a small outpouching in the posterior neck on the swallowing study suggests a Zenker's diverticulum, which is a herniation of the mucosa through a weak area in the posterior pharyngeal wall. 

The nerve most likely involved in this patient's symptoms is the vagus nerve (CN X). The vagus nerve innervates the muscles involved in swallowing, including the pharyngeal muscles, which are responsible for initiating the swallowing reflex. Dysfunction of the vagus nerve can lead to impaired swallowing and the symptoms described by the patient. 

The other cranial nerves listed in the options are not directly involved in the swallowing process. CN VII (facial nerve) is responsible for facial expression and taste sensation, CN IX (glossopharyngeal nerve) is involved in taste sensation and the gag reflex, CN V (trigeminal nerve) is responsible for sensation in the face and motor function of the muscles of mastication, CN XII (hypoglossal nerve) is responsible for motor function of the tongue, and CN XI (accessory nerve) is responsible for motor function of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. None of these nerves are directly involved in the swallowing process.",
"A 48-year-old female presents with an enlargement of her anterior neck which made swallowing very difficult for 2 weeks now. She has had constipation for the past 6 weeks and overall fatigue. She also had heavy menstrual bleeding; and often feels extremely cold at home. On the other hand, she has well-controlled asthma and spring allergies. On examination, the thyroid is stony hard, tender and asymmetrically enlarged. There is also pain associated with swallowing. Laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L. A radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake. Which of the following is the most likely pathology to be found in this patient?
Options:
(A): Anaplastic carcinoma
(B): Medullary carcinoma
(C): Granulomatous thyroiditis
(D): Reidel thyroiditis
(E): Silent thyroiditis
",Reidel thyroiditis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Reidel thyroiditis.

Explanation:
Reidel thyroiditis, also known as invasive fibrous thyroiditis, is a rare chronic inflammatory disorder of the thyroid gland. It is characterized by the replacement of normal thyroid tissue with fibrous tissue, leading to a hard, stony consistency of the thyroid gland. 

In this patient, the presence of an enlarged, stony hard, tender, and asymmetrically enlarged thyroid gland is consistent with the findings of Reidel thyroiditis. The difficulty in swallowing and pain associated with swallowing are also common symptoms of this condition. 

The laboratory studies show a serum T4 level of 4.4 μg/dL, which is within the normal range, and a TSH level of 6.3 mU/L, which is slightly elevated. This is consistent with the hypothyroid state often seen in Reidel thyroiditis. 

The radionuclide thyroid scanning indicates that the nodule has low radioactive iodine uptake, which is also a characteristic finding in Reidel thyroiditis. 

The other options, including anaplastic carcinoma, medullary carcinoma, granulomatous thyroiditis, and silent thyroiditis, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings. Anaplastic carcinoma is a rapidly growing and aggressive thyroid cancer, which typically presents with a rapidly enlarging neck mass and is associated with a poor prognosis. Medullary carcinoma is a type of thyroid cancer that arises from the parafollicular C cells and is associated with elevated calcitonin levels. Granulomatous thyroiditis, also known as subacute thyroiditis, is an inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland that is often preceded by a viral infection and is associated with pain and tenderness of the thyroid gland. Silent thyroiditis is a painless form of thyroiditis that is characterized by transient hyperthyroidism followed by a return to normal thyroid function.",
"A researcher is testing an unknown compound, X, and seeing the effect it has on renal function. When she applies compound X to the cells, she finds that the urinary concentration of sodium and the pH decreases while the urinary potassium increases. Which of the following correctly states:
1) the cells of the kidney this compound acts on and
2) the identity of compound X?
Options:
(A): Distal convoluted tubule; atrial natriuretic peptide
(B): Loop of Henle; furosemide
(C): Distal convoluted tubule; hydrochlorothiazide
(D): Principal cells; aldosterone
(E): Principal cells; spironolactone
",Principal cells,Incorrect, aldosterone,"The correct choice is (D): Principal cells; aldosterone

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the compound X causes a decrease in urinary concentration of sodium and pH, while increasing urinary potassium. This pattern of effects suggests that compound X is acting on the principal cells of the kidney. Principal cells are responsible for reabsorbing sodium and secreting potassium in the distal nephron. 

Aldosterone is a hormone that acts on the principal cells to increase sodium reabsorption and potassium secretion. Therefore, the identity of compound X is likely aldosterone."
"A 5-year-old male is brought to the pediatrician with complaints of a painful mouth/gums, and vesicular lesions on the lips and buccal mucosa for the past 4 days. The patient has not been able to eat or drink due to the pain and has been irritable. The patient also reports muscle aches. His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1, HR 110, BP 90/62, RR 18, SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for vesicular lesions noted on the tongue, gingiva, and lips, with some vesicles having ruptured and ulcerated, as well as palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism in this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): CMV
(B): EBV
(C): HIV
(D): HSV-1
(E): HSV-2
",HSV-1,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) HSV-1.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with herpetic gingivostomatitis, which is most commonly caused by HSV-1. Herpetic gingivostomatitis is characterized by painful vesicular lesions on the lips, buccal mucosa, and gingiva, which can rupture and ulcerate. The patient's symptoms of a painful mouth/gums, vesicular lesions, and inability to eat or drink due to pain are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of palpable cervical and submandibular lymphadenopathy is a common finding in herpetic gingivostomatitis. The other options (CMV, EBV, HIV, HSV-2) are less likely to cause this specific presentation.",
"A patient is unresponsive in the emergency department following a motor vehicle accident. The patient's written advance directive states that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. The patient's wife arrives and demands that ""everything"" be done to keep him alive because she ""can't go on living without him."" The patient's adult son is on his way to the hospital. If the patient arrests, which of the following should occur?
Options:
(A): Respect the wife's wishes and resuscitate the patient
(B): Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate
(C): Allow the patient's adult son to make the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate
(D): Consult a judge for the final decision on whether or not to resuscitate
(E): Consult the hospital ethics committee
",Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Respect the patient's prior wishes and do not resuscitate.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has a written advance directive stating that he does not wish to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest. Advance directives are legal documents that allow individuals to express their healthcare preferences in advance, especially in situations where they may not be able to communicate their wishes. These directives should be respected and followed by healthcare providers.

Even though the patient's wife demands that ""everything"" be done to keep him alive, her wishes cannot override the patient's prior expressed wishes. The patient's adult son, who is on his way to the hospital, does not have the authority to make the final decision on resuscitation either.

Consulting a judge for the final decision or involving the hospital ethics committee is not necessary in this case because the patient's wishes are clearly stated in the advance directive. Respecting the patient's prior wishes and not resuscitating him is the appropriate course of action.",
"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of retrosternal chest pain. He describes it as 7 out of 10 in intensity. He has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His current medications are aspirin, simvastatin, metformin, and enalapril. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 33 years. On arrival, his pulse is 136/min and irregular, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Coronary angiogram
(B): Intravenous esmolol
(C): Intravenous amiodarone
(D): Synchronized cardioversion
(E): Defibrillation
",Synchronized cardioversion,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Synchronized cardioversion.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of retrosternal chest pain, irregular pulse, and low blood pressure, along with the ECG showing atrial fibrillation, the most appropriate next step in management would be synchronized cardioversion.

Synchronized cardioversion is the delivery of a synchronized electrical shock to the heart during a specific phase of the cardiac cycle, usually during the QRS complex, in order to restore normal sinus rhythm. It is the treatment of choice for unstable patients with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response, as in this case.

Coronary angiogram (A) is not the most appropriate next step in management because the patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with atrial fibrillation, not an acute coronary syndrome.

Intravenous esmolol (B) is a beta-blocker that can be used to control heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, in this case, the patient's blood pressure is already low, and the priority is to restore normal sinus rhythm.

Intravenous amiodarone (C) is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to convert atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. However, in this case, the patient is unstable with low blood pressure, and synchronized cardioversion would be a more immediate and effective intervention.

Defibrillation (E) is the delivery of an unsynchronized electrical shock to the heart in order to treat life-threatening arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. It is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with stable atrial fibrillation.",
"A 14-year-old boy presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and is found on ultrasound to have a gallstone. Based on clinical suspicion, a CBC, a Coombs test, and a bilirubin panel are obtained to determine the etiology of the gallstone. These tests reveal a mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis as well as an increased RDW. In addition there is an indirect hyperbilirubinemia and the Coombs test results are negative. To confirm the diagnosis, an osmotic fragility test is performed which shows increased fragility in hypotonic solution. In this patient, what findings would most likely be anticipated if a blood smear were obtained?
Options:
(A): Hypersegmented neutrophils
(B): Schistocytes
(C): Sideroblasts
(D): Spherocytes
(E): Dacrocytes
",Spherocytes,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Spherocytes.

Explanation:
In this patient, the presence of a gallstone and the laboratory findings of mild normocytic anemia with associated reticulocytosis, increased RDW, indirect hyperbilirubinemia, and negative Coombs test are suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis. 

Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder characterized by defects in the red blood cell membrane, leading to the formation of spherocytes. Spherocytes are smaller, rounder, and denser than normal red blood cells. They lack the central pallor and have a decreased surface-to-volume ratio, making them more prone to hemolysis. 

On a blood smear, numerous microspherocytes and polychromasia would be expected in patients with hereditary spherocytosis. Polychromasia refers to the presence of immature red blood cells, or reticulocytes, in the peripheral blood. The reticulocyte count is often elevated in hereditary spherocytosis, indicating increased red blood cell production in response to the hemolysis. 

Hypersegmented neutrophils are typically seen in megaloblastic anemias, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, and are not associated with hereditary spherocytosis. Schistocytes are fragmented red blood cells and are seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemias, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), but are not characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis. Sideroblasts are nucleated red blood cells with iron granules in the cytoplasm and are seen in sideroblastic anemias, which are not associated with hereditary spherocytosis. Dacrocytes, or teardrop cells, are seen in conditions such as myelofibrosis or thalassemia, but are not characteristic of hereditary spherocytosis.",
"A 32-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of a tingling sensation in his right forearm. He reports that his symptoms started after he lifted heavy weights at the gym. Physical examination shows loss of sensation on the lateral side of the right forearm. Sensation over the thumb is intact. Range of motion of the neck is normal. His symptoms do not worsen with axial compression or distraction of the neck. Further examination of this patient is most likely to show weakness of which of the following actions?
Options:
(A): Shoulder abduction
(B): Elbow flexion
(C): Forearm pronation
(D): Index finger flexion
(E): Wrist extension
",Elbow flexion,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Elbow flexion.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a radial nerve injury. The radial nerve innervates the muscles responsible for elbow flexion, forearm pronation, wrist extension, and finger extension. However, the patient's symptoms of tingling sensation and loss of sensation on the lateral side of the forearm suggest involvement of the superficial branch of the radial nerve, which specifically innervates the muscles responsible for wrist extension and finger extension.

Shoulder abduction is not likely to be affected in this case, as the radial nerve does not innervate the muscles responsible for shoulder abduction.

Forearm pronation is also not likely to be affected, as the radial nerve primarily innervates the muscles responsible for forearm supination.

Index finger flexion is not likely to be affected, as the radial nerve does not innervate the muscles responsible for finger flexion.

Wrist extension is a possibility, as the radial nerve innervates the muscles responsible for wrist extension. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest involvement of the superficial branch of the radial nerve, which specifically innervates the muscles responsible for wrist extension and finger extension.

Therefore, the most likely weakness in this patient would be in elbow flexion, as the radial nerve innervates the muscles responsible for this action.",
"A 30-year-old woman presents to your office with decreased appetite, malaise, and fever. Serologic tests reveal positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies. Which of the following is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): Needlestick
(B): Unprotected sex
(C): Shellfish
(D): Chronic hepatitis
(E): Acetaminophen overdose
",Shellfish,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Shellfish.

Explanation:
The patient's positive Anti-HBsAg and Anti-HAV IgM antibodies indicate that she has been exposed to both hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV). Hepatitis A is typically transmitted through the fecal-oral route, often due to contaminated food or water. Shellfish, particularly raw or undercooked shellfish, can be a source of hepatitis A infection. Therefore, in this case, the most likely source of the patient's presentation is shellfish consumption. Needlestick injuries, unprotected sex, chronic hepatitis, and acetaminophen overdose are not consistent with the serologic findings and symptoms described.",
"A 63-year-old patient presents to the emergency department because of severe left leg pain and tingling. His condition started suddenly 30 minutes ago. He has had hypertension for the past 10 years for which he takes bisoprolol. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, and the pulse is 100/min and irregular. On physical examination, the patient appears in severe pain and his left leg is pale and cool. The popliteal pulse is weaker on the left side compared to the right side. Which of the following is the most common cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Vasculitis
(B): Hyperhomocysteinemia
(C): Arterial thrombosis
(D): Arterial emboli
(E): Arterial trauma
",Arterial emboli,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Arterial emboli.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of sudden severe left leg pain and tingling, along with the physical examination findings of a pale and cool left leg and weaker popliteal pulse on the left side, the most likely cause of his condition is arterial emboli. Arterial emboli occur when a blood clot or other material travels through the bloodstream and becomes lodged in a smaller artery, blocking blood flow to the affected area. This can lead to ischemia and tissue damage, resulting in symptoms such as pain, tingling, and changes in skin color and temperature. 

Vasculitis, or inflammation of the blood vessels, can also cause similar symptoms, but it is less common than arterial emboli. Hyperhomocysteinemia, an elevated level of homocysteine in the blood, is a risk factor for arterial thrombosis, but it is not the most common cause of the patient's condition. Arterial thrombosis, or the formation of a blood clot within an artery, is another possible cause, but arterial emboli are more common. Arterial trauma, or injury to an artery, is less likely in this case as there is no history of trauma mentioned in the patient's presentation.",
"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her father for evaluation. He is concerned that she has not undergone puberty yet, while all of her classmates at school have. The patient herself feels well overall, with no specific complaints. Examination shows vital signs of T 98.9, HR 71, and BP 137/92. The physician notes undeveloped breasts and normal external and internal female genitalia in Tanner I stage of development. Her body mass index is within normal limits, she is in the 40th percentile for height, and she is agreeable and pleasant during the interview. Which of the following additional findings is likely present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Aromatase enzyme deficiency
(B): Hypokalemia
(C): Increased levels of sex hormones
(D): XY karyotype
(E): Hypercortisolism
",Hypokalemia,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Hypokalemia.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with delayed puberty, as she has not yet undergone breast development and is in Tanner stage I. Delayed puberty can be caused by various factors, including hormonal imbalances. In this case, the likely cause of delayed puberty is hypokalemia.

Hypokalemia refers to low levels of potassium in the blood. Potassium is an essential electrolyte that plays a crucial role in various bodily functions, including muscle and nerve function. It is also involved in the production of sex hormones. Low potassium levels can disrupt the normal hormonal balance, leading to delayed puberty.

The patient's normal external and internal female genitalia and normal body mass index suggest that there is no underlying anatomical or weight-related issue causing the delayed puberty. Additionally, there are no indications of increased levels of sex hormones or hypercortisolism, as the patient does not have any specific complaints or signs of hormonal excess. The XY karyotype is not relevant in this case, as the patient has normal female external and internal genitalia.

Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient is hypokalemia, which can disrupt the hormonal balance and contribute to delayed puberty. Further evaluation and management of the hypokalemia would be necessary to address the delayed puberty.",
"Current recommendations state that a single hemoglobin A1c value of greater than 6.5% is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. If this 6.5% cut-off is to be increased to 7.0%, which of the following would be true?
Options:
(A): Increase in false negative test results
(B): Increase in false positive test results
(C): Decrease in true negative test results
(D): Increase in true positive test results
(E): Decrease in test specificity
",Increase in false negative test results,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Increase in false negative test results.

Explanation:
The current recommendation for diagnosing diabetes mellitus is a single hemoglobin A1c value greater than 6.5%. If the cut-off is increased to 7.0%, it means that a higher A1c value would be required to diagnose diabetes. This would result in an increase in false negative test results.

False negative test results occur when a person actually has the condition (diabetes) but the test result indicates that they do not. In this case, increasing the cut-off to 7.0% means that individuals with an A1c value between 6.5% and 7.0% would no longer be diagnosed with diabetes, leading to false negative results.

Therefore, increasing the cut-off to 7.0% would result in an increase in false negative test results.",
"Patients with the diagnosis of sickle cell anemia make a specific type of hemoglobin known as HgbS. This mutation results in the sickling of their red blood cells when exposed to inciting factors such as hypoxic conditions. Patients are often treated with hydroxyurea, which has which of the following direct effects on their hemoglobin physiology?
Options:
(A): Increases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
(B): Decreases oxygen carrying capacity of hemoglobin
(C): Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)
(D): Decreases levels of HgbS
(E): Decreases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF)
",Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF),Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Increases levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).

Explanation:
Hydroxyurea is a medication commonly used to treat patients with sickle cell anemia. It works by increasing the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF) in the patient's blood. Fetal hemoglobin is a type of hemoglobin that is normally produced during fetal development and early infancy. It has properties that differ slightly from adult hemoglobin (HbA), including a slightly higher oxygen affinity. 

In patients with sickle cell anemia, the presence of HgbF can help prevent the polymerization of deoxy-sickle hemoglobin (HbS), which is responsible for the sickling of red blood cells. Increasing the levels of HgbF reduces the proportion of HbS and dilutes the intracellular HbS concentration, thereby reducing the abnormal polymerization of hemoglobin molecules. This ultimately helps to decrease the severity of sickle cell disease and reduce the incidence of vaso-occlusive events such as painful episodes and acute chest syndrome.

Therefore, the direct effect of hydroxyurea on hemoglobin physiology in patients with sickle cell anemia is to increase the levels of fetal hemoglobin (HgbF).",
"A 40-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He has a history of cirrhosis of the liver secondary to alcoholism. He started becoming more confused a few days ago and it has been getting gradually worse. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 134/90 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals a distended abdomen that is non-tender. Neurological exam is notable for a confused patient and asterixis. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 59 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best next treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Ceftriaxone
(B): Dextrose
(C): Lactulose
(D): Potassium
(E): Rifaximin
",Potassium,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Potassium.

Explanation:
This patient's altered mental status and history of cirrhosis suggest hepatic encephalopathy, which is a complication of liver disease characterized by impaired brain function. The laboratory values show a low potassium level (K+: 3.3 mEq/L), which can contribute to the altered mental status. Hypokalemia can cause neurological symptoms such as confusion and asterixis. Therefore, the best next treatment for this patient would be to administer potassium to correct the hypokalemia and improve the neurological symptoms.",
"A previously healthy 4-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her parents because she has not stopped crying for the past 5 hours. Her parents report that she has not eaten anything during this period and that they were unable to calm her down. She has not had any trauma. She was born at term via vaginal delivery and her delivery was uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a reddened and swollen 2nd toe of the left foot. A photograph of the left foot is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Raynaud phenomenon
(B): Ingrown toe nail
(C): Insect bite
(D): Hair tourniquet syndrome
(E): Herpetic whitlow
",Hair tourniquet syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Hair tourniquet syndrome.

Hair tourniquet syndrome is a condition in which a strand of hair or thread becomes tightly wrapped around a body part, causing constriction and swelling. It commonly affects infants and young children, and can lead to significant pain and distress. In this case, the 4-month-old girl's persistent crying and refusal to eat, along with the reddened and swollen toe, are consistent with hair tourniquet syndrome.

Raynaud phenomenon is a condition characterized by episodes of vasospasm in the small arteries of the fingers and toes, resulting in color changes (pallor, cyanosis, and erythema) and pain. It typically occurs in response to cold temperatures or emotional stress, and is more common in older children and adults.

Ingrown toenail is a condition in which the edge of the toenail grows into the surrounding skin, causing pain, redness, and swelling. It is unlikely to cause the persistent crying and refusal to eat described in this case.

Insect bites can cause localized redness, swelling, and itching, but they are unlikely to cause the prolonged crying and refusal to eat seen in this case.

Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection of the finger or toe, typically caused by the herpes simplex virus. It presents with painful, fluid-filled blisters and is more common in older children and adults.

Therefore, hair tourniquet syndrome is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the clinical presentation and the age of the patient.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents to the physician because of episodes of difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. She feels solid food getting stuck in her chest behind the sternum. She does not have any issues with liquids. She has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. She has no hoarseness or weight loss. She reports occasional heartburn that has lasted for about a year. Her past medical history is significant for asthma and eczema. She has no history of any serious illness and takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. An endoscopic image of the esophagus is shown. Mucosal biopsy shows eosinophilic infiltration. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?
Options:
(A): Amlodipine
(B): Budesonide
(C): Fluconazole
(D): Nitroglycerin
(E): Omeprazole
",Omeprazole,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Omeprazole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on endoscopy and mucosal biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). EoE is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus. It commonly presents with symptoms of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction, as seen in this patient. The absence of coughing or nasal regurgitation suggests that the symptoms are limited to the esophagus.

Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for EoE. PPIs reduce gastric acid secretion and can help alleviate symptoms of acid reflux, which is commonly associated with EoE. While PPIs do not directly treat the underlying eosinophilic inflammation, they can provide symptomatic relief and improve esophageal mucosal healing.

Amlodipine (A) is a calcium channel blocker used to treat hypertension and angina, but it is not indicated for the treatment of EoE.

Budesonide (B) is a corticosteroid that can be used as an alternative treatment for EoE. It has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce eosinophilic inflammation in the esophagus. However, omeprazole is typically tried first before considering budesonide.

Fluconazole (C) is an antifungal medication used to treat fungal infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of EoE.

Nitroglycerin (D) is a vasodilator used to treat angina. It is not indicated for the treatment of EoE.",
"A 2-year-old boy in respiratory distress is brought to the emergency department by his parents. They state that approximately one hour after putting their child to sleep, a ""hacking"" cough was heard from his bedroom. After entering his room the parents state their child appeared to be in distress, making a high pitched noise with every breath. Beyond a runny nose for the past few days, the child has been healthy. He has no toys in his bed or access to any other small objects. Physical exam demonstrates a 2-year-old child in respiratory distress.

Which of the following choices is the proper management for this patient?
Options:
(A): Humidified oxygen and dexamethasone; discharge if the patient improves
(B): Discharge from the emergency department without treatment
(C): Dexamethasome, racemic epinephrine and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits
(D): Broncoscopy to remove a foreign body in the upper airway then discharge
(E): Empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics, intubate and admission
","Dexamethasome, racemic epinephrine and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits",Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Dexamethasome, racemic epinephrine and observation for 4 hours; discharge if stridor remits.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the 2-year-old boy is presenting with respiratory distress, a ""hacking"" cough, and a high-pitched noise with every breath. These symptoms are consistent with croup, which is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the upper airway, leading to the characteristic symptoms.

The proper management for croup includes the administration of dexamethasone, which is a corticosteroid that helps reduce airway inflammation. Racemic epinephrine, a bronchodilator, can also be given to provide temporary relief of symptoms by reducing airway swelling. 

Observation for 4 hours is necessary to monitor the child's response to treatment. If the stridor (high-pitched noise) remits and the child's condition improves, then discharge from the emergency department is appropriate.

Humidified oxygen may be used to provide supportive care, but it is not the primary treatment for croup. Discharging the patient without treatment (option B) would not address the underlying inflammation and could potentially lead to worsening symptoms. Bronchoscopy to remove a foreign body (option D) is not indicated based on the given information. Empiric IV antibiotics, intubation, and admission (option E) are not necessary for the management of croup, which is a viral infection.",
"A 70-year-old woman with no significant medical history begins to experience memory loss and personality changes. Over the next few months, her symptoms become more severe, as she experiences rapid mental deterioration. She also starts to have sudden, jerking movements in response to being startled and gait disturbances. Eventually, she lapses into a coma and dies eight months after the onset of symptoms. What process likely caused this woman's illness?
Options:
(A): Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta.
(B): Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system.
(C): Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the peripheral nervous system.
(D): Conversion of a protein from an a-helix to a ß-pleated form, which resists degradation.
(E): Frontotemporal atrophy and the accumulation of intracellular, aggregated tau protein.
","Conversion of a protein from an a-helix to a ß-pleated form, which resists degradation.",Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Conversion of a protein from an a-helix to a ß-pleated form, which resists degradation.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the scenario are consistent with a prion disease, specifically Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a rare, degenerative neurological disorder caused by the accumulation of an abnormal isoform of the prion protein (PrPSc) in the brain. PrPSc is formed when the normal, cellular prion protein (PrPC) undergoes a conformational change from an alpha-helical structure to a beta-pleated sheet structure. This abnormal form of the protein is resistant to degradation and tends to aggregate, leading to the formation of plaques in the brain.

The conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is thought to be the underlying cause of CJD. The accumulation of PrPSc in the brain leads to neuronal dysfunction and death, resulting in the progressive neurological symptoms seen in CJD, such as memory loss, personality changes, rapid mental deterioration, jerking movements, gait disturbances, and eventually coma and death.

Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (option A) is characteristic of Parkinson's disease, not CJD. Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system (option B) are seen in conditions like multiple sclerosis, but not in CJD. Autoimmune inflammation and demyelination of the peripheral nervous system (option C) are seen in conditions like Guillain-Barré syndrome, but not in CJD. Frontotemporal atrophy and the accumulation of intracellular, aggregated tau protein (option E) are seen in frontotemporal dementia, not CJD.",
"A 38-year-old woman presents with eye dryness and a foreign body sensation in the eyes. On physical examination, the oral cavity shows mucosal ulceration and atrophy. Biopsy of the lower lip shows marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands. Which of the following is most likely seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody
(B): Anti-centromere antibody
(C): Anti-Jo-1 antibody
(D): Anti-Scl-70 antibodies
(E): Anti-double stranded (-ds)DNA
",Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibody.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation of eye dryness, oral mucosal ulceration, and lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands is consistent with Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands, leading to dryness of the eyes and mouth. The presence of marked lymphocytic infiltration of the minor salivary glands on biopsy supports the diagnosis.

Anti-Sjögren's syndrome type B (SS-B) antibodies are often present in primary Sjögren's syndrome and tend to correlate with the presence of extra-glandular manifestations. These antibodies are one of the diagnostic criteria for Sjögren's syndrome and are commonly detected in patients with the disease.

The other options are not associated with Sjögren's syndrome:
(B) Anti-centromere antibody is associated with limited systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).
(C) Anti-Jo-1 antibody is associated with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
(D) Anti-Scl-70 antibodies are associated with diffuse systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).
(E) Anti-double stranded (-ds)DNA antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.",
"A 62-year-old man with a history of chronic bronchitis comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of worsening shortness of breath and cough productive of thick sputum. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Physical examination shows an increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally. Treatment with a drug that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways is begun. Which of the following drugs was most likely started?
Options:
(A): Fluticasone
(B): Montelukast
(C): Albuterol
(D): Tiotropium
(E): Cromolyn
",Tiotropium,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Tiotropium.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario has a history of chronic bronchitis, which is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is usually progressive. The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath and productive cough are consistent with exacerbation of COPD.

The physical examination findings of increased anteroposterior chest diameter and coarse crackles in the lower lung fields bilaterally suggest the presence of hyperinflation and air trapping, which are common in COPD.

The drug that was most likely started in this patient is tiotropium. Tiotropium is a long-acting anticholinergic medication that directly antagonizes the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways. It works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the airway smooth muscle, leading to bronchodilation and improved airflow.

Fluticasone (A) is an inhaled corticosteroid that is commonly used in the treatment of asthma, but it is not the first-line treatment for COPD exacerbations.

Montelukast (B) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is used in the treatment of asthma, but it is not typically used as first-line therapy for COPD exacerbations.

Albuterol (C) is a short-acting beta-agonist that is commonly used as a rescue medication for acute bronchospasm in both asthma and COPD. While albuterol may be used in the treatment of COPD exacerbations, it does not directly antagonize the effects of vagal stimulation on the airways like tiotropium does.

Cromolyn (E) is a mast cell stabilizer that is used in the treatment of asthma, but it is not typically used in the treatment of COPD exacerbations.

Therefore, the most likely drug that was started in this patient is tiotropium (D).",
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation of his sense of smell. Two days ago, his mother found that he had left the gas on in the kitchen, and he was unable to smell the odor of the gas. As a child, he was consistently in the 40th percentile for height; now he is in the 15th percentile. He had bilateral orchidopexy for cryptorchidism as an infant. The patient is unable to identify several common odors when presented with them. Physical examination shows sparse axillary and pubic hair and Tanner stage 1 genitals. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Compression of pituitary stalk
(B): Hyperprolactinemia
(C): Impaired migration of GnRH neurons
(D): Sex chromosome trisomy
(E): Decreased thyroxine production
",Impaired migration of GnRH neurons,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Impaired migration of GnRH neurons.

The patient's presentation is consistent with Kallmann syndrome, which is characterized by anosmia (inability to smell) and hypogonadism (underdevelopment of the reproductive system). Kallmann syndrome is caused by impaired migration of GnRH neurons from the olfactory placode to the hypothalamus during fetal development. This results in the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and deficiency of GnRH, leading to decreased production of sex hormones and delayed puberty.

The patient's history of cryptorchidism (undescended testicles) is also suggestive of Kallmann syndrome, as it is commonly associated with this condition. Additionally, the physical examination findings of sparse axillary and pubic hair and Tanner stage 1 genitals further support the diagnosis of hypogonadism.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation:
(A): Compression of pituitary stalk would typically present with symptoms related to pituitary hormone deficiencies, such as growth hormone deficiency or hypothyroidism.
(B): Hyperprolactinemia would present with symptoms related to excess prolactin, such as galactorrhea (abnormal breast milk production) or menstrual irregularities.
(D): Sex chromosome trisomy, such as Klinefelter syndrome (XXY), can cause hypogonadism, but it would not explain the patient's anosmia.
(E): Decreased thyroxine production (hypothyroidism) can cause delayed puberty, but it would not explain the patient's anosmia.",
"A 26-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up vaccination 1 week after being bitten by a rodent while camping. She received appropriate post-exposure prophylaxis in the emergency department and has already received 2 doses of the rabies vaccine. The same physician has been managing the post-exposure care regimen. After the physician administers the third dose of the rabies vaccine, the patient asks him if he would like to join her for a movie and dinner. The physician is interested in going on a date with her. Which of the following is the most appropriate reaction for the physician to have to the patient's invitation?
Options:
(A): Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.
(B): Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because her case is uncomplicated and does not require decision-making on his part.
(C): Inform the patient that dating her will never be appropriate even once the physician-patient relationship has been terminated.
(D): Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her, but that she will have to transfer her care to a different physician.
(E): Inform the patient that he will go on a date with her because she no longer requires his service as a physician.
""
",Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Inform the patient that romantic relationships with current patients are unethical.

Explanation:
It is important for healthcare professionals to maintain appropriate boundaries and avoid engaging in romantic or sexual relationships with current patients. This is because such relationships can compromise the objectivity and professionalism of the healthcare provider and may lead to exploitation or harm to the patient. The physician should inform the patient that it is unethical to pursue a romantic relationship while she is still under his care. It is important to prioritize the patient's well-being and maintain a professional relationship.",
"A 38-year-old nursing home worker presents to the clinic with complaints of fever, loss of appetite, fatigue, and productive cough for the past couple of months. His fever is low-grade and sputum is often blood-tinged. He has lost 6.8 kg (15.0 lb) during this period and complains of profound night sweats. A plain radiograph of the patient’s chest shows consolidation in the apical part of the right lung. Baseline investigations show the following:
Complete blood count
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
White blood cells  
Total count 16,000/mm3
Differential count  
Neutrophils 35%
Lymphocytes 54%
Eosinophils 11%
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 84 mm
The physician suspects that the patient is suffering from a chronic lung infection. Which of the following statements best describes the type of lung inflammation in this patient?
Options:
(A): There are small granulomas with few epithelioid cells along with fibrosis.
(B): It has a granuloma with Anitchov cells around a core of fibrinoid collagen necrosis.
(C): It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.
(D): An ill-defined granuloma with macrophages and epithelioid cells is seen in this type of inflammation.
(E): This type of granulomatous inflammation is also seen in histoplasmosis.
",It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): It consists of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells with Langhans cells.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings, the patient is likely suffering from tuberculosis, which is a chronic lung infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The presence of fever, weight loss, night sweats, and productive cough are classic symptoms of tuberculosis. The low-grade fever and blood-tinged sputum are also consistent with tuberculosis.

The chest radiograph showing consolidation in the apical part of the right lung is a common finding in tuberculosis, as the disease often affects the upper lobes of the lungs. This consolidation represents the inflammatory response to the infection.

The complete blood count shows an elevated white blood cell count, with a predominance of lymphocytes. This is also typical of tuberculosis, as lymphocytes are the primary immune cells involved in the response to mycobacterial infection.

The presence of a largely circumscribed granuloma with epithelioid cells and Langhans cells is characteristic of tuberculosis. Granulomas are formed in response to chronic inflammation and are composed of a central core of epithelioid cells surrounded by lymphocytes and fibroblasts. Langhans cells, which are multinucleated giant cells, are often seen in tuberculosis granulomas.

Option (A) is incorrect because small granulomas with few epithelioid cells along with fibrosis are not characteristic of tuberculosis.

Option (B) is incorrect because granulomas with Anitchov cells around a core of fibrinoid collagen necrosis are seen in Wegener granulomatosis, not tuberculosis.

Option (D) is incorrect because an ill-defined granuloma with macrophages and epithelioid cells is not specific to tuberculosis and can be seen in various other granulomatous diseases.

Option (E) is incorrect because while granulomatous inflammation can be seen in histoplasmosis, the clinical presentation and radiographic findings described in the question are more consistent with tuberculosis.",
"A 16-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath after prolonged exposure to cold air during a recent hike with his friends. He informs the physician that he is asthmatic, but does not use inhalers regularly because he does not like using medications. He is a non-smoker and occasionally drinks alcohol. On physical examination, the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the pulse is 120/min, the blood pressure is 114/76 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 32/min. Auscultation of the chest reveals bilateral wheezing. The physician asks the nurse to administer nebulized albuterol; however, the boy declines nebulized albuterol because of a history of palpitations that he experienced previously. The physician then prescribes nebulized ipratropium bromide, which results in significant clinical improvement. Which of the following second messenger systems is affected by the drug that improved the boy's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system
(B): Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system
(C): Arachidonic acid system
(D): Phosphoinositol system
(E): Tyrosine kinase system
",Phosphoinositol system,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Phosphoinositol system.

Explanation:
Nebulized ipratropium bromide is a bronchodilator that works by blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors in the airways. This leads to smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. The muscarinic receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are linked to the phosphoinositol system.

When acetylcholine binds to muscarinic receptors, it activates the phosphoinositol system, leading to the production of inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 then triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores, which leads to smooth muscle contraction. By blocking the action of acetylcholine on muscarinic receptors, ipratropium bromide inhibits the activation of the phosphoinositol system, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation.

The other options are not correct:

(A) Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) system: This system is involved in the action of beta-agonists, such as albuterol. Albuterol stimulates beta-2 adrenergic receptors, leading to the activation of the cAMP system, which results in smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. However, ipratropium bromide does not act on the cAMP system.

(B) Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) system: This system is involved in the action of nitric oxide, which is a potent vasodilator. It is not directly involved in bronchodilation.

(C) Arachidonic acid system: This system is involved in the production of inflammatory mediators, such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. It is not directly involved in bronchodilation.

(E) Tyrosine kinase system: This system is involved in cell signaling and regulation of cell growth and differentiation. It is not directly involved in bronchodilation.",
"A 2050-g (4.5-lb) female newborn and a 2850-g (6.3-lb) female newborn are delivered at 37 weeks' gestation to a 23-year-old, gravida 2, para 1 woman. The mother had no prenatal care. Examination of the smaller newborn shows a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot. The hematocrit is 42% for the smaller newborn and 71% for the larger newborn. This pregnancy was most likely which of the following?
Options:
(A): Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic
(B): Dichorionic-diamniotic dizygotic
(C): Monochorionic-monoamniotic monozygotic
(D): Dichorionic-monoamniotic monozygotic
(E): Conjoined twins
",Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic.

Explanation:
The presence of a flattened nose and left-sided clubfoot in the smaller newborn suggests a congenital anomaly. These anomalies are commonly seen in monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic twins. Monochorionic-diamniotic twins share the same placenta (monochorionic) but have separate amniotic sacs (diamniotic). Monozygotic twins occur when a single fertilized egg splits into two embryos. The difference in hematocrit levels between the smaller and larger newborns is likely due to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, a condition that can occur in monochorionic twins where there is an imbalance in blood flow between the twins. The lack of prenatal care in this case further supports the possibility of a monochorionic-diamniotic monozygotic pregnancy, as these pregnancies are at higher risk for complications and require close monitoring.",
"A 55-year-old woman is found to have an abnormal mass on routine mammography. The mass is biopsied and cytology results are diagnostic for invasive ductal adenocarcinoma that is estrogen receptor positive. The patient is started on chemotherapy and ultimately has the mass resected. She is taking tamoxifen and has regular outpatient follow up appointments to monitor for any recurrence of cancer. The patient has a past medical history of asthma, obesity, and a uterine leimyoma which was definitively treated last year. Her last menstrual period was at the age of 47. The patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable. Which of the following is a potential complication that could occur in this patient?
Options:
(A): Deep venous thrombosis
(B): Endometrial cancer
(C): Eruption of seborrheic keratoses
(D): Increased bleeding
(E): Osteoporosis
",Deep venous thrombosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Deep venous thrombosis.

Explanation:
Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) is a potential complication that could occur in this patient. Tamoxifen, which the patient is taking, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that is commonly used in the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, tamoxifen has been associated with an increased risk of developing DVT. This is because tamoxifen has both estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects, and the estrogenic effects can increase the risk of blood clot formation. It is important for patients taking tamoxifen to be aware of the signs and symptoms of DVT, such as leg pain, swelling, and redness, and to seek medical attention if they experience these symptoms.

Endometrial cancer (B) is not a potential complication in this patient because she has a past medical history of a uterine leiomyoma, which was definitively treated last year. Uterine leiomyomas, also known as fibroids, are benign tumors of the uterus and do not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.

Eruption of seborrheic keratoses (C) is not a potential complication in this patient. Seborrheic keratoses are benign skin growths that are commonly seen in older individuals and are not related to breast cancer or its treatment.

Increased bleeding (D) is not a potential complication in this patient. While chemotherapy and surgery can increase the risk of bleeding, the patient's vital signs and exam are unremarkable, suggesting that she does not have any active bleeding or clotting disorders.

Osteoporosis (E) is not a potential complication in this patient. While tamoxifen can have an effect on bone density, it is more commonly associated with a protective effect on bone and a decreased risk of osteoporosis. Additionally, the patient's age and menopausal status (last menstrual period at age 47) suggest that she may already be at an increased risk of osteoporosis, but it is not directly related to her breast cancer or its treatment.",

Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia?""
Options:
(A): Increased water intake
(B): Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion
(C): Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion
(D): Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion
(E): Decreased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion
",Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Decreased antidiuretic hormone secretion.

Explanation:
Hypernatremia refers to an elevated serum sodium level, which in this case is 148 mEq/L. The most likely explanation for this patient's hypernatremia is decreased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion.

ADH, also known as vasopressin, is a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary gland. Its main function is to regulate water balance in the body by increasing water reabsorption in the kidneys. ADH acts on the collecting ducts of the kidneys, increasing their permeability to water and allowing for water reabsorption back into the bloodstream.

In this patient's case, the decreased ADH secretion leads to impaired water reabsorption in the kidneys, resulting in excessive water loss and subsequent hypernatremia. The symptoms of agitation, confusion, and lethargy are consistent with the effects of hypernatremia on the central nervous system.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings:
- Increased water intake (option A) would not lead to hypernatremia, as excess water intake would dilute the serum sodium concentration.
- Increased antidiuretic hormone secretion (option B) would actually lead to hyponatremia, as excessive ADH would cause excessive water reabsorption and dilution of the serum sodium concentration.
- Increased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion (option C) and decreased adrenocorticotropin hormone secretion (option E) are not directly related to water balance and would not explain the hypernatremia in this case.",
"A 29-year-old woman presents to the physician with a blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days. She has pain around her right eye during eye movement. She takes no medications. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following?
Options:
(A): Dry eyes
(B): High-risk sexual behaviour
(C): Oral ulcers
(D): Sensory loss
(E): Late preterm birth
",Sensory loss,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Sensory loss.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of blurred vision, pain around the right eye during eye movement, and optic disk swelling in the right eye suggests a diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory condition that affects the optic nerve and can cause vision loss. It is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system.

Sensory loss is an important additional history to obtain because it can help determine if the patient has any other symptoms suggestive of MS. MS can present with a variety of neurological symptoms, including sensory loss, weakness, numbness, tingling, and difficulty with coordination. Obtaining a detailed history of any sensory loss in other parts of the body can help support the diagnosis of MS and guide further evaluation and management.

Dry eyes (option A) may cause eye discomfort and vision changes, but it is not typically associated with optic neuritis or MS. High-risk sexual behavior (option B) and oral ulcers (option C) are not relevant to the patient's presentation and are not associated with optic neuritis or MS. Late preterm birth (option E) is also not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and is not associated with optic neuritis or MS.",
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with complaints of cyclic vomiting for 3 days. The vomitus is watery and contains undigested food particles. She also complains of feeling tired and having the “sniffles”. She has not felt like eating or drinking since her symptoms started, and she has not taken any medications. Her concern now is that she immediately gets dizzy when she stands up. Vitals signs include: pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 9/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry. Which set of lab values would best correspond to this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 50 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L
(B): pH = 7.2, Pco2 = 25 mm Hg, HCO32- = 30 mEq/L
(C): pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 34 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L
(D): pH = 7.2, Pco2 = 55 mm Hg, HCO32- = 22 mEq/L
(E): pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 30 mm Hg, HCO32- = 24 mEq/L
","pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 50 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L",Correct,"The correct answer is (A): pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 50 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of cyclic vomiting, watery vomitus with undigested food particles, fatigue, and ""sniffles"" suggest dehydration and metabolic alkalosis. The low respiratory rate of 9/min indicates respiratory compensation for the metabolic alkalosis. The low blood pressure, sunken eyes, and dry tongue are consistent with dehydration.

In metabolic alkalosis, there is an excess of bicarbonate (HCO3-) in the blood, leading to an increase in pH. The normal range for pH is 7.35-7.45, so a pH of 7.5 indicates alkalosis. The normal range for Pco2 is 35-45 mm Hg, so a Pco2 of 50 mm Hg is within the normal range and indicates respiratory compensation for the alkalosis. The normal range for HCO3- is 22-28 mEq/L, so a HCO3- level of 38 mEq/L is elevated and consistent with metabolic alkalosis.

The other options do not match the patient's clinical presentation. Option (B) has a low Pco2 and low HCO3-, which would be consistent with metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis. Option (C) has a normal Pco2 and elevated HCO3-, which would be consistent with metabolic alkalosis, but the pH is normal, not elevated. Option (D) has a low pH, high Pco2, and low HCO3-, which would be consistent with respiratory acidosis, not alkalosis. Option (E) has a normal pH, low Pco2, and low HCO3-, which would be consistent with metabolic acidosis, not alkalosis.",
"A 30-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of infertility. He and his wife have been trying to get pregnant for the past two years. They have used fertility monitors and other aids without success. A hysterosalpingogram in his wife was normal. The patient has a history of cleft lip and recurrent upper respiratory infections as a child. He was briefly hospitalized for severe pneumonia when he was 9-years-old. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 120/85 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing male in no acute distress with fully developed reproductive organs. Notably, cardiac auscultation is silent in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. This patient most likely has a mutation in which of the following classes of proteins?
Options:
(A): Microtubule monomeric protein
(B): Lysosomal trafficking regulator protein
(C): Transmembrane ion channel protein
(D): Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein
(E): Anterograde cytoskeletal motor protein
",Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Kartagener syndrome, which is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis, and bronchiectasis. Kartagener syndrome is caused by mutations in the dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5) gene, which encodes a retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein. This protein is responsible for the movement of cilia and flagella, and its dysfunction leads to impaired ciliary motility. In the respiratory tract, impaired ciliary motility results in recurrent upper respiratory infections and bronchiectasis. In the reproductive tract, impaired ciliary motility can lead to infertility. The absence of cardiac auscultation in the left 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line is consistent with dextrocardia, which is commonly seen in patients with Kartagener syndrome due to situs inversus. Therefore, the most likely mutation in this patient is in a retrograde cytoskeletal motor protein.",
"A 71-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension comes to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation. She has had multiple episodes of upper abdominal pain over the past year. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 30 years. Physical examination shows a distended abdomen with diffuse tenderness and high-pitched bowel sounds. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Perforation of the duodenal wall
(B): Inflammation of the gallbladder wall
(C): Obstruction of the common bile duct
(D): Occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery
(E): Torsion of the large intestine
",Inflammation of the gallbladder wall,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Inflammation of the gallbladder wall.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder wall. The patient has a history of upper abdominal pain, which is a common symptom of cholecystitis. The presence of vomiting and obstipation suggests bowel obstruction, which can occur due to inflammation and edema of the gallbladder wall. The distended abdomen, diffuse tenderness, and high-pitched bowel sounds are also consistent with bowel obstruction. The x-ray findings of a dilated bowel, multiple air-fluid levels, and branching radiolucencies in the right infra-diaphragmatic region are classic findings of gallstone ileus, which is a rare complication of cholecystitis. The patient's risk factors for cholecystitis include her age, history of diabetes mellitus, and smoking history.",
"A 36-year-old man undergoes open reduction and internal fixation of a left femur fracture sustained after a motor vehicle collision. Three days after the surgery, he develops fever and redness around the surgical site. His temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F). Physical examination shows purulent discharge from the wound with erythema of the surrounding skin. Wound culture of the purulent discharge shows gram-positive cocci in clusters. Treatment with oral dicloxacillin is initiated. Four days later, the patient continues to have high-grade fever, pain, and purulent discharge. Which of the following characteristics of the infecting organism best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy?
Options:
(A): Secretion of a pyrogenic toxin
(B): Presence of an impenetrable outer membrane
(C): Ability to cleave β-lactam rings
(D): Development of efflux pumps
(E): Adaptation in binding proteins
",Adaptation in binding proteins,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Adaptation in binding proteins.

Explanation:
The failure to improve with antibiotic therapy in this case suggests that the infecting organism has adapted in its binding proteins. Binding proteins are responsible for the binding of antibiotics to their target sites, such as bacterial cell wall synthesis enzymes or bacterial ribosomes. By adapting in their binding proteins, bacteria can modify the target site and prevent the antibiotic from effectively binding and inhibiting its function.

In this case, the wound culture showed gram-positive cocci in clusters, which are commonly associated with Staphylococcus aureus infections. Staphylococcus aureus is known to have the ability to adapt in its binding proteins, particularly in the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) that are targeted by β-lactam antibiotics like dicloxacillin. This adaptation can result in reduced binding affinity between the antibiotic and the target site, leading to treatment failure.

Therefore, the presence of an infecting organism with adaptation in binding proteins best explains the failure to improve with antibiotic therapy in this patient.",
"A 45-year-old woman comes into your office with complaints of ""lump"" she found on her neck while showering. She denies any other symptoms and states that she has not gained any weight. On exam, you notice a 2 cm nodule on her anterior neck. Her TSH level is normal and radionucleotide scan reveals a cold nodule. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) reveals follicular architecture suspicious for malignancy. What is the next best step?
Options:
(A): Punch biopsy
(B): Surgical excision
(C): Thyroxine administration
(D): Ultrasound
(E): CT scan
",Surgical excision,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Surgical excision.

Explanation:
In the case of a patient with a cold nodule on radionucleotide scan and suspicious findings on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), the next best step is surgical excision. Cold nodules have a higher risk of malignancy compared to hot nodules. FNAB findings suspicious for malignancy indicate a higher likelihood of thyroid cancer. Therefore, surgical excision is necessary to definitively diagnose and treat the suspected malignancy. Other options such as punch biopsy, thyroxine administration, ultrasound, or CT scan are not the next best step in this scenario. Punch biopsy is not appropriate for evaluating thyroid nodules. Thyroxine administration is not indicated as the patient's TSH level is already normal. Ultrasound and CT scan may provide additional information about the nodule, but surgical excision is still required for definitive diagnosis and treatment.",
"While in the ICU, a 62-year-old male undergoes placement of a Swan-Ganz catheter to evaluate his right heart pressures. All pressures are found to be within normal limits, and the cardiology fellow records a pulmonary wedge pressure of 10 mmHg. Which of the following are normal values for the pressures that will be obtained from this patient's right ventricle?
Options:
(A): 25/10 mmHg
(B): 25/5 mmHg
(C): 10/0 mmHg
(D): 100/5 mmHg
(E): 100/70 mmHg
",25/5 mmHg,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): 25/5 mmHg.

Explanation:
According to the provided context information, the normal right ventricular systolic pressure ranges from 15 to 25 mmHg, and the normal right ventricular end-diastolic pressure ranges from 3 to 12 mmHg. Therefore, the normal values for the pressures obtained from this patient's right ventricle would be around 25/5 mmHg. Option (B) is the closest match to these normal values.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. Over the past 8 months, his mother reports difficulty understanding the boy's speech. On occasion during this period, she has noticed that he does not respond when called by name and cannot follow 1-step instructions. He has a history of recurrent ear infections treated with antibiotics since birth. He is at the 60th percentile for length and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. His speech is quiet and difficult to understand. Otoscopic examination shows retracted tympanic membranes bilaterally that are immobile on pneumatic otoscopy. Nasopharyngoscopy shows mild adenoid hypertrophy. Pure tone audiometry shows a conductive hearing loss of 26 dB on the right side and 28 dB on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Nasal decongestant therapy
(B): Adenoidectomy
(C): Tympanostomy tube insertion
(D): Antihistamine therapy
(E): Corticosteroid therapy
""
",Tympanostomy tube insertion,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Tympanostomy tube insertion.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis for this 3-year-old boy is secretory otitis media, also known as glue ear. Secretory otitis media is characterized by the presence of fluid in the middle ear without signs of acute infection. It often occurs following recurrent ear infections and can lead to conductive hearing loss and speech delay.

The retracted tympanic membranes and immobile on pneumatic otoscopy are consistent with the diagnosis of secretory otitis media. The conductive hearing loss on pure tone audiometry further supports this diagnosis.

The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is tympanostomy tube insertion. Tympanostomy tubes are small ventilating tubes that are inserted into the eardrum to provide drainage from the middle ear to the outer ear. This helps to equalize pressure, prevent fluid accumulation, and improve hearing. Tympanostomy tube insertion is the treatment of choice for persistent or recurrent secretory otitis media that is causing significant hearing loss or speech delay.

Nasal decongestant therapy (option A) may provide temporary relief of nasal congestion but does not address the underlying issue of fluid accumulation in the middle ear.

Adenoidectomy (option B) may be considered in cases of persistent or recurrent secretory otitis media with significant adenoid hypertrophy. However, it is not the most appropriate initial step in management for this patient.

Antihistamine therapy (option D) and corticosteroid therapy (option E) may be used in children with allergies to help manage symptoms, but they are not the primary treatment for secretory otitis media.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is tympanostomy tube insertion (option C).",
"A 42-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with decreased consciousness and convulsions. His wife reports that 30 min following the onset of her husband’s condition, which started approximately 6 hours ago, he treated his garden bed with pesticides against mice. He developed nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps. The patient noted facial muscle twitching and developed a tonic-clonic seizure that lasted 3 minutes, 4 hours following the onset of his condition. His past medical history is insignificant for any seizure disorders, and he does not take any medications. His blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg, heart rate is 104/min, respiratory rate is 10/min, and the temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient’s consciousness is decreased with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13. He is pale and sweaty. His lung sounds are normal, cardiac sounds are decreased, and no murmurs are present. Abdominal palpation reveals epigastric tenderness. Neurological examination shows rapid downbeating nystagmus, facial muscle twitching, and symmetrically decreased sensation to all the sensory modalities on both the upper and lower extremities. Further discussion reveals that the patient was using sodium fluoroacetate as a pesticide, which is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Which of the following substances will accumulate in the patient’s cells?
Options:
(A): Fumarate
(B): Citrate
(C): Isocitrate
(D): Malate
(E): Succinate
",Citrate,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Citrate.

Explanation:
Sodium fluoroacetate, the pesticide used by the patient, is known to form fluorocitrate in the cells of aerobic organisms. Fluorocitrate is an inhibitor of aconitase, an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle). The citric acid cycle is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria and is responsible for the production of energy in the form of ATP.

When fluorocitrate inhibits aconitase, it disrupts the citric acid cycle and leads to the accumulation of citrate in the cells. Citrate is normally an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, but when aconitase is inhibited, it cannot be further metabolized. As a result, citrate accumulates in the cells.

The accumulation of citrate can have several effects on cellular metabolism. It can disrupt the production of ATP, leading to decreased energy production. It can also interfere with other metabolic pathways that rely on the citric acid cycle, such as the production of amino acids and fatty acids.

In the case of the patient described, the accumulation of citrate in his cells can contribute to his symptoms, including decreased consciousness, convulsions, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and muscle twitching. The accumulation of citrate can also explain the neurological findings, such as the rapid downbeating nystagmus and decreased sensation in the extremities.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Citrate.",
"A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. 90 minutes ago, the patient was found by a neighbor unarousable on the couch with multiple empty bottles of medication on the floor next to her. Social history is significant for alcohol abuse. Physical examination reveals an awake female with a fluctuating level of consciousness, not oriented to time or place. No focal neurologic deficits. Which of the following additional findings would most likely be present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Hallucinations
(B): Insidious course
(C): Irreversibility
(D): Multi-infarct dementia
(E): Normal vital signs
",Hallucinations,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Hallucinations.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient's altered mental status, history of alcohol abuse, and multiple empty bottles of medication suggest an overdose or poisoning. The fluctuating level of consciousness and disorientation to time and place are consistent with an altered mental state. Hallucinations are a common symptom of intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol and certain medications. Therefore, the most likely additional finding in this patient would be hallucinations.",
"A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a cough, dyspnea, and fever for 1 day. The cough is productive of small amounts of green phlegm. He has metastatic colon cancer and has received three cycles of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin; his last chemotherapy session was 2.5 months ago. He has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and has been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone for acute exacerbations three times in the past year. His medications include a fluticasone-salmeterol inhaler and a tiotropium bromide inhaler. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 48 years. His temperature is 39.1°C (103.1°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 88/69 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 88%. Pulmonary examination shows diffuse crackles and rhonchi. An x-ray of the chest shows a left upper-lobe infiltrate of the lung. Two sets of blood cultures are obtained. Endotracheal aspirate Gram stain shows gram-negative rods. Two large bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluids are administered. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Ceftriaxone and azithromycin
(B): Ertapenem
(C): Colistin
(D): Cefepime and levofloxacin
(E): Clarithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate
",Cefepime and levofloxacin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Cefepime and levofloxacin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and history, he likely has a severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) with risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms. The presence of gram-negative rods on the endotracheal aspirate Gram stain suggests the possibility of a resistant organism. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.

Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that has excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is often used in the treatment of severe CAP. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has broad-spectrum activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including atypical pathogens such as Legionella and Mycoplasma. It is also effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Therefore, the combination of cefepime and levofloxacin would provide coverage against a wide range of potential pathogens in this patient with severe CAP and risk factors for multidrug-resistant organisms.",
"A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been ""acting strangely."" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world. He used to be a straight A student but started failing exams recently due to his erratic behavior. Furthermore, there are periods of time where he does not sleep for several days and redecorates the entire apartment. During those times he spends huge amounts of money on online shopping. These periods usually last for about 2 weeks and happen every other month. On physical exam, he appears unkept and irritated. He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): Bipolar with psychotic features
(B): Brief psychotic disorder
(C): Schizoaffective disorder
(D): Schizophreniform disorder
(E): Schizotypal personality disorder
",Schizoaffective disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Schizoaffective disorder.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is most consistent with schizoaffective disorder. Schizoaffective disorder is characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions, and mood disorder symptoms, such as mania or depression. In this case, the patient is experiencing hallucinations (hearing voices telling him to prepare for the end of the world) and manic symptoms (periods of not sleeping, spending large amounts of money, and redecorating the apartment). The manic symptoms lasting for about 2 weeks every other month suggest a cyclical pattern, which is consistent with schizoaffective disorder. The patient's jumping from topic to topic without clear focus and responding to invisible stimuli are also indicative of psychosis. Bipolar disorder with psychotic features (option A) is a possibility, but the presence of hallucinations and delusions outside of mood episodes suggests a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizoaffective disorder. Brief psychotic disorder (option B) is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for less than 1 month, which does not fit with this patient's presentation. Schizophreniform disorder (option D) is characterized by symptoms similar to schizophrenia but with a duration of 1 to 6 months, which does not fit with this patient's presentation. Schizotypal personality disorder (option E) is characterized by odd or eccentric behavior, but it does not involve the presence of hallucinations or delusions.",
"An 81-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his son to be evaluated for memory issues. The patient’s son says he has difficulty remembering recent events and names. He says the patient’s symptoms have progressively worsened over the last several years but became acutely worse just recently. Also, yesterday, the patient complained that he could not see out of his right eye, but today he can. When asked about these concerns, the patient seems to have no insight into the problem and reports feeling well. His medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension. He had a left basal ganglia hemorrhage 12 years ago and a right middle cerebral artery infarction 4 years ago. Current medications are amlodipine, aspirin, clopidogrel, metformin, sitagliptin, and valsartan. He lives with his son and can feed himself and change his clothes. There is no history of urinary or fecal incontinence. His vitals include: blood pressure 137/82 mm Hg, pulse 78/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, the patient is alert and oriented. He is unable to perform simple arithmetic calculations and the mini-mental status exam is inconclusive. He can write his name and comprehend written instructions. Muscle strength is 4/5 on the right side. The tone is also slightly reduced on the right side with exaggerated reflexes. His gait is hemiparetic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Alzheimer's disease
(B): Frontotemporal dementia
(C): Lewy body dementia
(D): Normal-pressure hydrocephalus
(E): Vascular dementia
",Vascular dementia,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Vascular dementia.

Explanation:
This patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with vascular dementia. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and is caused by cerebrovascular disease, such as stroke or small vessel disease. Risk factors for vascular dementia include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and previous strokes, all of which are present in this patient. The patient's history of a left basal ganglia hemorrhage and a right middle cerebral artery infarction further supports the diagnosis of vascular dementia. The acute worsening of symptoms may be due to a recent cerebrovascular event. The patient's fluctuating course, with complaints of visual loss that resolved, is also consistent with vascular dementia. On examination, the patient has hemiparesis, reduced tone, and exaggerated reflexes on the right side, indicating a previous stroke. The inability to perform simple arithmetic calculations and inconclusive mini-mental status exam are also consistent with vascular dementia, as these patients often have executive dysfunction.",
"A 46-year-old woman with a history of previously well-controlled HIV infection comes to the physician for follow-up after a health maintenance examination last week. She is currently unemployed and lives in a low-income neighborhood with her 3 children. For the past 3 years, her HIV RNA viral load was undetectable, but last week, her viral load was 8,391 copies/mL (N < 50). Current medications include dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine. On questioning, she says that she misses her medications every other day. Which of the following responses by the physician is most appropriate?
Options:
(A): """"""Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.""""""
(B): """"""Are you aware that it is essential to take your medications every day?""""""
(C): """"""You should know that skipping doses will make your HIV harder to treat.""""""
(D): """"""The social worker can help subsidize next month's medications.""""""
(E): """"""We should go over the instructions on how to take your medications again.""""""
","""""""Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.""""""",Correct,"The correct choice is (A) ""Let's talk about what makes it difficult for you to take your medications.""

Explanation:
This response acknowledges the patient's difficulty in taking her medications and opens up a conversation about the barriers she may be facing. It is important to understand the reasons behind her non-adherence in order to address them effectively. By discussing the challenges she is facing, the physician can work with the patient to find solutions and improve her adherence to the medication regimen. This approach is patient-centered and promotes open communication, which is crucial in managing HIV infection effectively.",
"A 67-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine medical check-up prior to a scheduled elective femoropopliteal bypass surgery of his left leg. He feels well but reports occasional episodes of weakness and numbness in his left hand. He has a history of peripheral arterial disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and gout. The patient has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He drinks 3 cans of beer daily. His current medications include aspirin, metformin, enalapril, simvastatin, and febuxostat. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 86/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Auscultation of the right side of the neck shows a bruit. There is a right-sided reducible inguinal hernia. Neurological examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and serum concentrations of electrolytes, creatinine, and glucose are within the reference ranges. An electrocardiogram shows signs of mild left ventricular hypertrophy. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Ultrasonography of the neck
(B): Echocardiography
(C): Warfarin therapy
(D): CT angiography of the head
(E): Digital subtraction angiography of the neck
",Ultrasonography of the neck,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Ultrasonography of the neck.

The patient in this case has a history of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and presents with a bruit on auscultation of the right side of the neck. These findings suggest the presence of carotid artery disease, which is a common cause of peripheral arterial disease. Carotid artery disease is a significant risk factor for stroke, and it is important to assess the degree of stenosis in the carotid arteries before proceeding with elective surgery.

Ultrasonography of the neck is the most appropriate next step in management because it is a non-invasive and accurate method for evaluating carotid artery disease. It can determine the degree of stenosis and help guide further management decisions. If significant carotid artery stenosis is identified, the patient may require carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting prior to the femoropopliteal bypass surgery.

Echocardiography (option B) may be useful in evaluating cardiac function and assessing for any structural abnormalities, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Warfarin therapy (option C) is not indicated at this time as there is no evidence of atrial fibrillation or other indications for anticoagulation.

CT angiography of the head (option D) and digital subtraction angiography of the neck (option E) are more invasive and higher-risk procedures compared to ultrasonography. They are typically reserved for cases where ultrasonography is inconclusive or when more detailed imaging is required.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is ultrasonography of the neck to evaluate for carotid artery disease.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider concerned that she may be pregnant. She has a history of regular menstruation every 4 weeks that lasts about 4 days with mild to moderate bleeding, but she missed her last period 2 weeks ago. A home pregnancy test was positive. She has a 6-year history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with daily methimazole. She is currently asymptomatic and has no complaints or concerns. A blood specimen is taken and confirms the diagnosis. Additionally, her thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is 2.0 μU/mL. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Continue methimazole
(B): Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil
(C): Add glucocorticoids
(D): Add propranolol
(E): Refer for radioiodine therapy
","Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Discontinue methimazole, start propylthiouracil.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient is pregnant and has a history of hyperthyroidism that is well-controlled with methimazole. Methimazole is contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy due to the risk of teratogenicity. Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to discontinue methimazole and start propylthiouracil, which is the preferred antithyroid medication during pregnancy.

Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the preferred antithyroid medication during the first trimester of pregnancy because it has a lower risk of teratogenicity compared to methimazole. After the first trimester, methimazole can be resumed if necessary. It is important to closely monitor thyroid function throughout pregnancy to ensure that the patient remains euthyroid.

Glucocorticoids are not indicated in the management of hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. They may be used in certain cases of thyroid storm or severe hyperthyroidism, but they are not the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to manage the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tachycardia and tremor. However, it does not address the underlying thyroid dysfunction and is not the first-line treatment for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy.

Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated during pregnancy due to the risk of fetal thyroid ablation and subsequent hypothyroidism. It is not the appropriate management option for this patient.",
"A 65-year-old man presents to the emergency department with back pain. The patient states that he has gradually worsening back pain that seems to have worsened after moving furniture the other day. He also states that while he walks, he feels numbness and weakness in his legs. The only time the patient states his back pain is improved is when he is riding his bike or pushing a cart at the grocery store. The patient has a past medical history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. He drinks 3 alcoholic drinks every day and has a 44 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 157/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a non-tender spine with normal mobility in all 4 directions. Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Compression fracture
(B): Herniated nucleus pulposus
(C): Musculoskeletal strain
(D): Spinal stenosis
(E): Vascular claudication
",Spinal stenosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Spinal stenosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis is a condition characterized by the narrowing of the spinal canal, which can lead to compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots. This can result in symptoms such as back pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs.

The patient's history of gradually worsening back pain, which worsened after moving furniture, is consistent with spinal stenosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of numbness and weakness in the legs while walking, known as neurogenic claudication, are classic findings in spinal stenosis. The fact that the patient experiences relief from back pain while riding a bike or pushing a cart suggests that these activities help to alleviate the symptoms of spinal stenosis by flexing the spine and relieving pressure on the nerves.

The patient's risk factors, including a history of osteoporosis, dyslipidemia, diabetes, heavy alcohol consumption, and smoking, are also associated with an increased risk of developing spinal stenosis.

Radiography of the spine and basic labs are ordered to further evaluate the patient's condition and confirm the diagnosis. Radiography may show evidence of spinal canal narrowing or other abnormalities, while basic labs can help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

In summary, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and risk factors, the most likely diagnosis is spinal stenosis.",
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fever, cough, purulent nasal discharge. She has experienced 7 similar episodes, each lasting 2–5 days in the previous 2 years. She has also had intermittent abdominal cramps and recurrent episodes of foul-smelling greasy diarrhea in the past year. She is at the 55th percentile for height and 35th percentile for weight. Her temperature is 38.9°C (102°F), pulse is 100/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows an erythematous oropharynx without exudate and tenderness over the frontoethmoidal sinuses. The abdomen is distended, nontender, and tympanitic to percussion. Bowel sounds are increased. Stool microscopy shows pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following?
Options:
(A): Progressive peripheral neuropathy
(B): Anaphylactic transfusion reactions
(C): Cutaneous granulomas
(D): Non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(E): Disseminated tuberculosis
",Anaphylactic transfusion reactions,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Anaphylactic transfusion reactions.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings, she is most likely suffering from Giardiasis, which is caused by the pear-shaped multi-flagellated organisms seen on stool microscopy. Giardiasis is a parasitic infection that commonly causes diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and foul-smelling stools. It can also lead to malabsorption and failure to thrive in children.

Patients with Giardiasis are at increased risk for anaphylactic transfusion reactions. This is because the infection can lead to the production of specific IgE antibodies, which can cause an allergic reaction when exposed to certain antigens, such as those found in blood transfusions. Therefore, patients with Giardiasis should be closely monitored during blood transfusions to prevent potential anaphylactic reactions.

Progressive peripheral neuropathy (choice A) is not associated with Giardiasis. Peripheral neuropathy can occur in certain conditions, such as diabetes or vitamin deficiencies, but it is not a known complication of Giardiasis.

Cutaneous granulomas (choice C) are not a common complication of Giardiasis. Cutaneous granulomas can occur in certain infections, such as tuberculosis or leishmaniasis, but they are not typically seen in Giardiasis.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (choice D) and disseminated tuberculosis (choice E) are not associated with Giardiasis. These conditions have different etiologies and are not directly related to Giardiasis.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Anaphylactic transfusion reactions.",
"An 8-year-old boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents with a rash. Past medical history is significant for a recent sore throat which caused him to miss several days at school. The patient’s vaccination status is unknown. On physical examination, the patient is pale and ill-looking. There are pink rings present on the torso and inner surfaces of the limbs. Cardiac exam is significant for a holosystolic murmur heard best over the apex of the heart. Which of the following histopathologic findings is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear
(B): Starry sky appearance
(C): Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystal deposits
(D): Granulomas with giant cells
(E): Caseating granulomas and giant cells
",Granulomas with giant cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Granulomas with giant cells.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with a rash, recent sore throat, and cardiac murmur is suggestive of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). ARF is a delayed immune response to group A Streptococcus infection, typically pharyngitis. It most commonly affects children between the ages of 5 and 15 years.

Histopathologic findings in ARF typically show granulomas with giant cells. These granulomas are composed of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages. The presence of giant cells, which are formed by the fusion of macrophages, is a characteristic feature of ARF.

Atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear (A) are typically seen in viral infections, such as infectious mononucleosis, and are not specific to ARF.

Starry sky appearance (B) is a histopathologic finding seen in Burkitt lymphoma, which is not associated with the patient's presentation.

Needle-shaped, negatively birefringent crystal deposits (C) are seen in gout, which is not associated with the patient's presentation.

Caseating granulomas and giant cells (E) are seen in tuberculosis, which is not associated with the patient's presentation.",
"A 59-year-old man presents to general medical clinic for his yearly checkup. He has no complaints except for a dry cough. He has a past medical history of type II diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, and depression. His home medications are sitagliptin/metformin, lisinopril, atorvastatin, albuterol inhaler, and citalopram. His vitals signs are stable, with blood pressure 126/79 mmHg. Hemoglobin A1C is 6.3%, and creatinine is 1.3 g/dL. The remainder of his physical exam is unremarkable. If this patient's cough is due to one of the medications he is taking, what would be the next step in management?
Options:
(A): Change citalopram to escitalopram
(B): Change lisinopril to propanolol
(C): Change lisinopril to amlodipine
(D): Change atorvastatin to to lovastatin
(E): Change lisinopril to losartan
",Change lisinopril to losartan,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Change lisinopril to losartan.

Explanation:
The patient's dry cough is most likely due to the medication lisinopril, which is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor commonly used to treat hypertension. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a dry cough in some patients, and this adverse effect is thought to be due to the accumulation of bradykinin in the lungs.

The next step in management would be to switch the patient from lisinopril to losartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). ARBs are an alternative class of medications used to treat hypertension and have a similar efficacy to ACE inhibitors. Unlike ACE inhibitors, ARBs do not cause a dry cough as a side effect. Therefore, switching the patient to losartan would likely resolve his dry cough while still effectively managing his hypertension.

It is important to note that changing the patient's other medications, such as citalopram, atorvastatin, or sitagliptin/metformin, would not address the underlying cause of the dry cough. Additionally, changing lisinopril to propranolol or amlodipine would not be appropriate as these medications do not have the same mechanism of action as lisinopril and would not effectively manage the patient's hypertension.",
"A male newborn is evaluated 24 hours after delivery for high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, and low-grade fever. He was born at 40 weeks' gestation at 2514 g (5.54 lb) to a 28-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, by an uncomplicated cesarean section. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. The infant's temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 170/min, and blood pressure is 71/39 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. These symptoms are mostly like due to maternal use of which of the following?
Options:
(A): GABAA receptor agonist
(B): Mu receptor agonist
(C): Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist
(D): Monoamine reuptake antagonist
(E): Thyroperoxidase inhibitor
",Mu receptor agonist,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Mu receptor agonist.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the newborn, including high-pitched crying, poor feeding, rhinorrhea, low-grade fever, hyperreflexia, tremors, and excessive startle response, are consistent with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS occurs when a newborn is exposed to drugs in utero and experiences withdrawal symptoms after birth. The most common cause of NAS is maternal opioid use, specifically mu receptor agonists such as heroin or prescription opioids like oxycodone or hydrocodone.

The mother's lack of prenatal care and the presence of withdrawal symptoms in the newborn strongly suggest maternal drug use during pregnancy. The symptoms of NAS typically appear within 24-72 hours after birth and can vary in severity depending on the type and amount of drug exposure.

GABAA receptor agonists (choice A) are not typically associated with the symptoms described in this case. They are more commonly used as sedatives or anxiolytics.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists (choice C) are not commonly associated with NAS. Maternal nicotine use during pregnancy can cause fetal growth restriction and other complications, but it does not typically result in the symptoms described in this case.

Monoamine reuptake antagonists (choice D) are not typically associated with NAS. These drugs, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly used to treat depression and anxiety disorders.

Thyroperoxidase inhibitors (choice E) are not typically associated with NAS. These drugs, such as propylthiouracil or methimazole, are used to treat hyperthyroidism and are not commonly associated with the symptoms described in this case.",
"A previously healthy 35-year-old primigravid woman at 12 weeks' gestation comes to the physician because of a fever, persistent headache, nausea, and abdominal discomfort for 1 week. During this time, she has also noticed that her gums bleed while brushing her teeth. A month ago, she returned from a camping trip to Sri Lanka. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°F), pulse is 104/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Examination shows pallor and mild scleral icterus.

A photograph of the peripheral blood smear is shown. Blood and urine cultures are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): HELLP syndrome
(B): Dengue hemorrhagic fever
(C): Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(D): Hemolytic uremic syndrome
(E): Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
""
",Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fever, and organ dysfunction. It is caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease ADAMTS13, leading to the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in small blood vessels.

In this case, the patient presents with fever, persistent headache, nausea, abdominal discomfort, and bleeding gums, which are all consistent with TTP. The laboratory findings of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) further support this diagnosis. The presence of schistocytes (red cell fragments) on the peripheral blood smear is a characteristic finding in TTP.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings:
- HELLP syndrome is a complication of pregnancy characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets. While this patient is pregnant, the laboratory findings and peripheral blood smear are not consistent with HELLP syndrome.
- Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a viral infection that can cause bleeding manifestations, but it typically presents with a more severe thrombocytopenia and a different clinical picture.
- Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is another thrombotic microangiopathy that can cause anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. However, it is more commonly associated with a prodrome of diarrhea, which is not mentioned in this case.
- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells by autoantibodies. While anemia is present in this case, the laboratory findings and peripheral blood smear are not consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).",
"A 36-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after being involved in a shooting. He sustained a gunshot wound in an altercation outside of a bar. On arrival, he is oriented to person but not to place or time. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 116/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 79/42 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 97%. Examination shows multiple abrasions over the arms and thorax. There is a 1-cm (0.4-in) entry wound with minimal bleeding on the right side of the chest in the 6th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. A focused assessment with sonography shows no obvious free fluid in the pericardium; assessment of the abdomen is equivocal. An x-ray of the chest shows mild opacification of the right lower lobe. Two large-bore cannulas are inserted and intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun. The patient is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Chest tube insertion in the fifth intercostal space at the midaxillary line
(B): CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
(C): Local wound exploration
(D): Exploratory laparotomy
(E): Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
",Exploratory laparotomy,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Exploratory laparotomy.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient has sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and presents with signs of hypovolemic shock (low blood pressure, tachycardia). The abdominal examination shows diffuse mild tenderness, which raises concern for intra-abdominal injury. The focused assessment with sonography is equivocal, and the x-ray shows opacification of the right lower lobe, suggesting a possible lung injury.

Given the mechanism of injury and the patient's presentation, there is a high suspicion for intra-abdominal injury, which may not be adequately assessed by physical examination or imaging alone. Exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate next step in management to identify and treat any potential intra-abdominal injuries, such as liver or bowel perforation, which may not be apparent on initial evaluation.

Chest tube insertion (option A) may be indicated if there is evidence of a pneumothorax or hemothorax, but this does not address the potential intra-abdominal injuries.

CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (option B) may provide more detailed information about the extent of injuries, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this unstable patient who requires immediate intervention.

Local wound exploration (option C) may be performed to assess the extent of the chest wall injury, but it does not address the potential intra-abdominal injuries.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (option E) may be considered in stable patients with specific indications, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this unstable patient with suspected intra-abdominal injuries.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is exploratory laparotomy (option D).",
"Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene results in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membranes of skeletal muscle in humans. This mutation results in a rare disease characterized by muscle cramping and stiffening that is usually most severe after exercise or strenuous activity and is typically relieved after affected individuals rest for a few minutes. Which of the following is expected in individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation?
Options:
(A): Muscle relaxation time: decreased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased
(B): Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased
(C): Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: no change
(D): Muscle relaxation time: no change, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased
(E): Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: decreased
","Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased",Correct,"The correct choice is (B): Muscle relaxation time: increased, cytosolic calcium concentration: increased.

Explanation: Mutations in the ATP2A1 gene result in loss of function of the calcium ATPase pump, which is responsible for pumping calcium ions from the cytosol into the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle. Without this pump, there is a decrease in the ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to sequester calcium ions, leading to an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. This increased cytosolic calcium concentration leads to prolonged muscle contraction and delayed muscle relaxation, resulting in muscle cramping and stiffening. Resting for a few minutes allows the cytosolic calcium concentration to decrease and muscle relaxation to occur. Therefore, individuals with an ATP2A1 gene mutation would have increased muscle relaxation time and increased cytosolic calcium concentration.",
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department with crushing chest pain (10/10 in severity), radiating to the left side of the neck and the left arm. His symptoms started 20 minutes ago while shaving. He also feels nauseated, lightheaded and short of breath. He has had type 2 diabetes for 27 years and essential hypertension for 19 years. He has smoked 20–30 cigarettes per day for the past 35 years. Family history is irrelevant. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg and the pulse is 107/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. ECG is shown in the image. Troponins are elevated. The patient is admitted to a unit with continuous cardiac monitoring. Aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine are given immediately and the patient now rates the pain as 4–5 out of 10. Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient condition?
Options:
(A): Percutaneous coronary intervention
(B): Intravenous alteplase
(C): Coronary artery bypass graft
(D): Oral ramipril
(E): Oral eplerenone
",Percutaneous coronary intervention,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Percutaneous coronary intervention.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and history, he is most likely experiencing an acute coronary syndrome, specifically an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The crushing chest pain, radiating to the left side of the neck and left arm, along with associated symptoms such as nausea, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, are classic symptoms of a myocardial infarction.

The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in multiple leads, confirming the diagnosis of STEMI. Elevated troponins further support the diagnosis.

The initial management of STEMI involves the administration of aspirin, clopidogrel, sublingual nitroglycerin, and morphine, which have already been given to the patient. These medications help to relieve pain, reduce myocardial oxygen demand, and prevent further clot formation.

The next step in the management of this patient is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI involves the use of a catheter to open the blocked coronary artery and restore blood flow to the heart muscle. It is the preferred treatment for STEMI, as it is associated with better outcomes compared to thrombolytic therapy (intravenous alteplase).

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a surgical procedure that may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the initial treatment of choice for STEMI.

Oral ramipril and oral eplerenone are medications used for long-term management of hypertension and heart failure, but they are not appropriate for the acute management of STEMI.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).",
"A 54-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of increasingly severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting. His last bowel movement was yesterday and he has not passed flatus since then. He underwent appendectomy at the age of 39. He has psoriasis, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic back pain. He drinks two beers daily. He takes a topical corticosteroid, ramipril, metformin, and ibuprofen daily. He is 176 cm (5 ft 9 in) tall and weighs 108 kg (240 lb); BMI is 35.4 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure is 112/67 mm Hg. Examination shows thick, scaly, plaques over both elbows and knees. Abdominal examination shows three well-healed laparoscopic scars. The abdomen is distended and there are frequent, high-pitched bowel sounds on auscultation. Digital rectal examination shows an empty rectum. Laboratory studies show:

Abdominal ultrasound shows nonpropulsive peristalsis of the small bowel. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?""
Options:
(A): Chronic inflammatory bowel disease
(B): Obesity
(C): Ibuprofen
(D): History of abdominal surgery
(E): Alcohol
",History of abdominal surgery,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): History of abdominal surgery.

Explanation:
The patient's history of abdominal surgery, specifically the appendectomy at the age of 39, is the most likely cause of his current condition. The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, and bilious vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of a distended abdomen and high-pitched bowel sounds, are consistent with a mechanical bowel obstruction. 

A history of abdominal surgery, especially involving the intestines, can lead to the formation of adhesions. Adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can develop between abdominal organs and tissues, causing them to stick together. These adhesions can lead to a mechanical obstruction of the bowel, preventing the normal passage of stool and gas.

The patient's symptoms of not passing flatus and having a distended abdomen further support the diagnosis of a bowel obstruction. The absence of bowel sounds on auscultation and an empty rectum on digital rectal examination are also consistent with this diagnosis.

While obesity, ibuprofen use, and alcohol consumption can all contribute to gastrointestinal issues, they are less likely to be the primary cause of a mechanical bowel obstruction in this patient. Chronic inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, can cause bowel obstruction, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has these conditions based on the provided information. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is his history of abdominal surgery.",
"A 28-year-old Caucasian woman presents to your office with recurrent abdominal cramping on her left side for 6 months. She additionally reports bloody diarrhea and tenesmus. You suspect ulcerative colitis. Which of the following findings would most strongly confirm your diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Involvement of terminal ileum
(B): No rectal involvement
(C): Noncaseating granulomas
(D): Transmural inflammation
(E): Continuous mucosal damage
",Continuous mucosal damage,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Continuous mucosal damage.

Explanation:
Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that primarily affects the colon and rectum. The hallmark feature of ulcerative colitis is continuous mucosal damage, which is characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum. This leads to symptoms such as bloody diarrhea and tenesmus, which the patient in this case presents with.

Option (A): Involvement of terminal ileum is more characteristic of Crohn's disease, another type of IBD. Ulcerative colitis typically affects the colon and rectum, without involvement of the terminal ileum.

Option (B): No rectal involvement is not consistent with ulcerative colitis. Rectal involvement is common in ulcerative colitis and can be a distinguishing feature from other types of IBD.

Option (C): Noncaseating granulomas are more commonly seen in Crohn's disease, not ulcerative colitis. Noncaseating granulomas are a histological finding that can help differentiate between the two conditions.

Option (D): Transmural inflammation is also more characteristic of Crohn's disease. Ulcerative colitis typically involves only the mucosal layer of the colon and rectum, without transmural inflammation.

Therefore, the finding of continuous mucosal damage would most strongly confirm the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis in this patient.",
"A 6-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents for difficulty breathing and bluish discoloration of the lips for the past hour. During the past 3 months, the patient has had several upper respiratory tract infections and poor weight gain. Physical examination shows crackles over both lung fields and enlargement of the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes. His serum IgA, IgE, and IgG titers are decreased. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid shows disc-shaped cysts. A defect in which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Actin filament assembly
(B): T-cell receptor signaling
(C): Thymus organogenesis
(D): Microtubule polymerization
(E): B-cell maturation
",T-cell receptor signaling,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) T-cell receptor signaling.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with a primary immunodeficiency disorder known as DiGeorge syndrome, which is caused by a defect in thymus organogenesis. DiGeorge syndrome is characterized by hypoplasia or aplasia of the thymus gland, leading to T-cell deficiency. This results in impaired T-cell receptor signaling and subsequent immune dysfunction.

The patient's symptoms of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, poor weight gain, and decreased serum immunoglobulin levels (IgA, IgE, and IgG) are all indicative of an immune deficiency. The crackles over both lung fields and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray suggest a pulmonary infection or inflammation.

The enlargement of the tonsils and cervical lymph nodes can be seen in DiGeorge syndrome due to the absence or underdevelopment of the thymus gland, which is responsible for the maturation of T-cells. The methenamine silver staining of bronchial lavage fluid showing disc-shaped cysts is consistent with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, a common opportunistic infection seen in patients with T-cell deficiencies.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is a defect in T-cell receptor signaling, which is characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome.",
"A 67-year-old man comes to the clinic complaining of fatigue and dizziness for the past 2 months. He reports that he gets tired easily compared to his baseline and feels dizzy when he exerts himself (e.g., when he walks long distances). His past medical history is significant for hypertension that is controlled with lisinopril. A physical examination demonstrates moderate hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy. His laboratory studies are shown below.

Leukocyte count and differential:
Leukocyte count: 11,500/mm^3
Segmented neutrophils: 40%
Bands: 3%

Mean corpuscular volume: 80 µm^3
Reticulocyte count: 3%
Lactate dehydrogenase: 45 U/L

A subsequent flow cytometry test demonstrates CD20+ cells. What is the most likely finding you would expect in this patient?
Options:
(A): Low levels of erythropoietin
(B): Low levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP)
(C): Myeloperoxidase positive cytoplasmic inclusions
(D): Presence of hairy cells
(E): Presence of smudge cells
",Presence of smudge cells,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Presence of smudge cells.

Explanation:
The presence of smudge cells is a characteristic finding in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is suggested by the flow cytometry test demonstrating CD20+ cells. Smudge cells, also known as basket cells or degenerative lymphocytes, are fragile lymphocytes that rupture during the preparation of blood smears, resulting in a characteristic appearance of fragmented or ""smudged"" cells. This finding is specific to CLL and is not seen in other types of leukemia or lymphoma.

Low levels of erythropoietin (option A) would not be expected in this patient as there is no evidence of anemia or decreased red blood cell production. The hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL is within the normal range, although it is slightly decreased.

Low levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) (option B) would not be expected in this patient as there is no evidence of a myeloproliferative disorder. The leukocyte count and differential are within normal limits, and there are no specific findings suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder.

Myeloperoxidase positive cytoplasmic inclusions (option C) would not be expected in this patient as there is no evidence of a myeloproliferative disorder. The leukocyte count and differential are within normal limits, and there are no specific findings suggestive of a myeloproliferative disorder.

The presence of hairy cells (option D) would not be expected in this patient as the clinical presentation and laboratory findings are not consistent with hairy cell leukemia. Hairy cell leukemia typically presents with pancytopenia, splenomegaly, and characteristic hairy cells on peripheral blood smear. In this patient, there is no evidence of pancytopenia, and the physical examination findings are more suggestive of lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly.",
"A 81-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he fell asleep at the dinner table and was not able to be roused by his family. His past medical history is significant for Alzheimer disease though he is still relatively functional at baseline. He has also been taking warfarin over the last 3 months after he suffered a deep venous thrombosis. After he was transported to the ED, his family found that the pills his grandson takes for seizures were missing. On presentation, he is found to be somnolent and physical exam reveals ataxia and nystagmus. After determining the cause of this patient's symptoms, his physicians begin monitoring his international normalized ratio, because they are concerned that it will start trending down. Which of the following treatments would most improve the urinary excretion of the substance likely responsible for these symptoms?
Options:
(A): Ammonium chloride
(B): Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(C): Mannitol
(D): Sodium bicarbonate
(E): Thiazide diuretics
",Sodium bicarbonate,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Sodium bicarbonate.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of somnolence, ataxia, and nystagmus are consistent with an overdose of a substance that affects the central nervous system. Given the history of the missing seizure medication, it is likely that the patient ingested his grandson's antiepileptic medication, which can cause sedation and ataxia in overdose.

To improve the urinary excretion of the substance responsible for these symptoms, the treatment of choice is sodium bicarbonate. Sodium bicarbonate is an alkaline substance that can increase the urinary pH. This alkalization of the urine can enhance the excretion of weakly acidic substances, such as the antiepileptic medication, by ion trapping. Ion trapping occurs when a weakly acidic substance becomes ionized in an alkaline environment, making it less likely to be reabsorbed by the renal tubules and more likely to be excreted in the urine.

Ammonium chloride (option A) is an acidifying agent and would not be effective in enhancing the excretion of a weakly acidic substance.

Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (option B) is a chelating agent that can bind to heavy metals and calcium. It is not effective in enhancing the excretion of medications.

Mannitol (option C) is an osmotic diuretic that can increase urine production but does not affect the urinary excretion of specific substances.

Thiazide diuretics (option E) are not effective in enhancing the excretion of weakly acidic substances. They primarily work by inhibiting sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidneys.",
"A 10-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of high-grade fever, myalgia, and generalized fatigue for 3 days. She returned from a vacation to northern Brazil 4 days ago.

Which of the following is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis?""
Options:
(A): Thick and thin blood smear
(B): Direct antiglobulin test
(C): Enzyme testing
(D): Sickle cell test
(E): Ultrasound of the abdomen
",Thick and thin blood smear,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Thick and thin blood smear.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with high-grade fever, myalgia, generalized fatigue, jaundice, and splenomegaly is consistent with a diagnosis of malaria. Malaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The most common species causing malaria in Brazil is Plasmodium vivax. 

Thick and thin blood smears are the gold standard for diagnosing malaria. The thick smear is used to detect the presence of parasites, while the thin smear is used to identify the species of Plasmodium. The presence of parasites in the blood smear confirms the diagnosis of malaria.

The other options are not appropriate for confirming the diagnosis of malaria in this case:
- (B) Direct antiglobulin test is used to diagnose autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.
- (C) Enzyme testing is not specific for malaria and would not confirm the diagnosis.
- (D) Sickle cell test is used to diagnose sickle cell disease, which is not relevant to this patient's presentation.
- (E) Ultrasound of the abdomen may be useful to assess the size of the spleen, but it does not confirm the diagnosis of malaria.",
"A 56-year-old woman presents to a physician with severe pain and swelling of the left inguinal area for 3 days. She has a fever and malaise. Last week she noted several painless red papules on her left thigh when she was on a summer trip to Madagascar. She has no history of serious illnesses and is on no medications. There has been no recent contact with any animals or pets. The temperature is 38.6℃ (101.5℉), the pulse is 78/min, the respiration rate is 12/min, and the blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Swelling of the left inguinal area was noted; however, there were no skin changes. Several large, tense, and tender lymph nodes with a boggy consistency were palpated in the inguinal region. The right inguinal area is normal on physical exam. There was no lymphadenopathy in other areas. No abnormalities existed in the lungs, heart, and abdomen. Microscopic examination of pus from the inguinal lymph nodes revealed gram-negative Coccobacilli. Serum anti-F1 titers show a 4-fold rise. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy at this time?
Options:
(A): Azithromycin
(B): Imipenem
(C): Chloramphenicol
(D): Streptomycin
(E): No pharmacotherapy
",Streptomycin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Streptomycin.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the patient is most likely suffering from bubonic plague, which is caused by the gram-negative Coccobacilli bacteria. The presence of severe pain and swelling in the left inguinal area, along with fever, malaise, and tender lymph nodes, is consistent with bubonic plague.

Streptomycin is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bubonic plague. It is a bactericidal antibiotic that is effective against the gram-negative Coccobacilli bacteria causing the infection. Streptomycin is the drug of choice for treating plague and has been shown to reduce mortality rates when administered early in the course of the disease.

Azithromycin, chloramphenicol, and imipenem are not the preferred treatment options for bubonic plague. Azithromycin and chloramphenicol may have some activity against the bacteria, but they are not as effective as streptomycin. Imipenem is not typically used for the treatment of bubonic plague.

No pharmacotherapy (option E) is not appropriate in this case because bubonic plague is a serious and potentially life-threatening infection that requires prompt treatment with antibiotics. Delaying treatment can lead to worsening of symptoms and complications.",
"A 60-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of sudden, painless loss of vision in her right eye that occurred 30 minutes ago while watching TV. She has coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus; she has had trouble adhering to her medication regimen. Her blood pressure is 160/85 mm Hg. Examination shows 20/50 vision in the left eye and no perception of light in the right eye. Direct pupillary reflex is present in the left eye, but absent in the right eye. Accommodation is intact bilaterally. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg in the left eye and 18 mm Hg in the right eye. Fundoscopic examination of the right eye shows a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula. The optic disc appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Central retinal vein occlusion
(B): Retinal detachment
(C): Central retinal artery occlusion
(D): Acute angle-closure glaucoma
(E): Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy
",Central retinal artery occlusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Central retinal artery occlusion.

Explanation:
The patient's sudden, painless loss of vision in the right eye, along with the absence of perception of light and absent direct pupillary reflex in the right eye, suggests a severe ischemic event affecting the retina. The presence of a pale, white retina with a bright red area within the macula on fundoscopic examination is consistent with central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO). CRAO is typically caused by embolic occlusion of the central retinal artery, leading to sudden and severe ischemia of the retina. Risk factors for CRAO include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus, all of which are present in this patient. The normal appearance of the optic disc suggests that the occlusion is located proximal to the optic disc. Immediate intervention is necessary to attempt to restore blood flow to the retina and potentially salvage vision. Options A, B, D, and E are not consistent with the clinical presentation and findings described.",
"A previously healthy 35-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of sudden weakness of her right arm and leg that started 3 hours ago. She returned from a business trip from Europe 3 days ago. She has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F), pulse is 115/min and regular, and blood pressure is 155/85 mm Hg. Examination shows decreased muscle strength on the entire right side. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ on the right. Babinski sign is present on the right. The left lower leg is swollen, erythematous, and tender to palpation. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Patent foramen ovale
(B): Atrial myxoma
(C): Mitral valve vegetation
(D): Atrial fibrillation
(E): Carotid artery dissection
",Patent foramen ovale,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Patent foramen ovale.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a paradoxical embolism, which occurs when a venous thrombus crosses from the right to the left side of the heart through a right-to-left shunt, such as a patent foramen ovale (PFO). The sudden onset of weakness in the right arm and leg, along with the presence of a right-to-left shunt, suggests an embolic event. The patient's recent travel history increases the suspicion for a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) as the source of the embolus. The swollen, erythematous, and tender left lower leg is consistent with a DVT. The presence of a PFO allows the embolus to bypass the pulmonary circulation and enter the systemic circulation, leading to symptoms of stroke. The decreased muscle strength on the entire right side, 4+ deep tendon reflexes on the right, and Babinski sign on the right are consistent with a left hemispheric stroke. Further evaluation, such as a transesophageal echocardiogram, is needed to confirm the presence of a PFO.",
"A 24-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room (ER) by her co-workers after they found her unconscious in her cubicle when they returned from lunch. They tell you that she has diabetes but do not know anything more about her condition. The woman’s vital signs include: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 24/min, temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), and blood pressure 90/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is breathing heavily and gives irrelevant responses to questions. The skin and mucous membranes appear dry. Examination of the abdomen reveals mild diffuse tenderness to palpation. Deep tendon reflexes in the extremities are 1+ bilaterally. Laboratory studies show:
Finger stick glucose 630 mg/dL
Arterial blood gas analysis:

The patient is immediately started on a bolus of intravenous (IV) 0.9% sodium chloride (NaCl). Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Infuse NaHCO3 slowly
(B): Switch fluids to 0.45% NaCl
(C): Start IV insulin infusion
(D): Replace potassium intravenously
(E): Start IV 5% dextrose
",Replace potassium intravenously,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Replace potassium intravenously.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a life-threatening complication of diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia, ketosis, and metabolic acidosis. The laboratory findings of high glucose, positive ketones, low bicarbonate (HCO3), and low pH confirm the diagnosis of DKA.

In DKA, there is a total body potassium deficit due to osmotic diuresis and intracellular shift of potassium. However, the initial serum potassium level may be normal or even elevated due to extracellular shifts of potassium. As insulin therapy is initiated, potassium is driven back into the cells, leading to a rapid decrease in serum potassium levels. Therefore, it is important to replace potassium intravenously to prevent hypokalemia and potential cardiac arrhythmias.

The other options are not the next best step in the management of this patient:
(A) Infusing NaHCO3 slowly is not indicated in this patient as the pH is only slightly low and can be corrected with insulin therapy.
(B) Switching fluids to 0.45% NaCl is not indicated as the patient is already receiving 0.9% NaCl, which is the appropriate initial fluid for resuscitation in DKA.
(C) Starting IV insulin infusion is the definitive treatment for DKA, but before initiating insulin therapy, potassium replacement should be started to prevent hypokalemia.
(E) Starting IV 5% dextrose is not indicated as the patient is already hyperglycemic and does not require additional glucose. Insulin therapy will help to lower the blood glucose levels.",
"A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his father because of altered mental status. According to the father, the patient was unable to get out of bed that morning and has become increasingly confused over the past several hours. The father also noticed it was “pretty cold” in his son's apartment because all of the windows were left open overnight. He has a history of hypothyroidism, schizoaffective disorder, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hypertension for which he takes medication. Ten days ago, he was started on a new drug. He appears lethargic. His rectal temperature is 32°C (89.6°F), pulse is 54/min, respirations are 8/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Examination shows weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes. Deep tendon reflexes are 1+ in the upper extremities. The pupils are dilated and poorly reactive to light. Throughout the examination, the patient attempts to remove his clothing. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?
Options:
(A): Lisinopril
(B): Fluphenazine
(C): Tolbutamide
(D): Levothyroxine
(E): Atorvastatin
""
",Fluphenazine,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Fluphenazine.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with the use of antipsychotic medications, such as fluphenazine. NMS is characterized by altered mental status, hyperthermia, autonomic dysfunction, and generalized muscle rigidity. The patient's altered mental status, lethargy, and attempts to remove his clothing are indicative of the altered mental status seen in NMS. The low rectal temperature of 32°C (89.6°F) is consistent with hypothermia, which can occur in severe cases of NMS. The dilated and poorly reactive pupils are also consistent with the autonomic dysfunction seen in NMS. The weakness in the lower extremities with absent deep tendon reflexes is indicative of generalized muscle rigidity, another hallmark feature of NMS. The fact that the patient was started on a new drug 10 days ago further supports the possibility of NMS as a drug-induced adverse effect. Therefore, fluphenazine is the most likely cause of these findings.",
"A 36-year-old woman presents with increased tiredness and lethargy for the past 4 weeks. Investigations show her hemoglobin level to be 8.6 gm/dL and serum creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL. The serum is negative for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and positive for C3 nephritic factor. Urinalysis shows a 3+ proteinuria. The renal biopsy demonstrates hypercellular glomerulus with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane. What is the most likely cause?
Options:
(A): Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN)
(B): Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
(C): Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
(D): Minimal change disease
(E): Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN)
",Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN),Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN).

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of increased tiredness and lethargy, along with laboratory findings of low hemoglobin level and elevated serum creatinine, suggests a renal disorder. The positive C3 nephritic factor and 3+ proteinuria on urinalysis further support a glomerular pathology.

Membrano proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is characterized by hypercellular glomeruli with electron dense deposits along the glomerular basement membrane, as seen in the renal biopsy findings described in the question. MPGN is associated with low C3 levels, which is consistent with the positive C3 nephritic factor in this case.

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is characterized by a recent history of streptococcal infection, which is not mentioned in the question. Additionally, PSGN typically presents with low C3 levels, which is not consistent with the positive C3 nephritic factor in this case.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) is characterized by a rapid decline in renal function, often leading to end-stage renal disease within weeks to months. While the patient in this case has an elevated serum creatinine, the duration of symptoms (4 weeks) is not consistent with the rapid progression seen in RPGN.

Minimal change disease is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, characterized by normal appearing glomeruli on light microscopy. This condition is unlikely in this case, as the renal biopsy findings demonstrate hypercellularity and electron dense deposits.

Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane without hypercellularity. This condition is not consistent with the renal biopsy findings described in the question.",
"A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department for sudden onset of difficulty breathing 6 hours ago. For the past several months, he has had shortness of breath on exertion and while lying down on the bed, frequent headaches, and swelling of his feet. He does not take any medications despite being diagnosed with hypertension 10 years ago. His pulse is 90/min, respirations are 20/min, blood pressure is 150/110 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination shows an overweight male in acute distress with audible wheezes. Crackles are heard bilaterally and are loudest at the lung bases. Which of the following findings on cardiac auscultation will most likely be present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Fixed split S2
(B): Loud P2
(C): S3 gallop
(D): Absent S4
(E): A loud S1
",S3 gallop,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) S3 gallop.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with symptoms of heart failure, including shortness of breath on exertion, orthopnea (shortness of breath while lying down), and peripheral edema (swelling of the feet). These symptoms, along with the physical examination findings of crackles heard bilaterally and wheezes, suggest that the patient has congestive heart failure (CHF).

The S3 gallop is an extra heart sound that is heard in patients with CHF. It is caused by rapid ventricular filling during diastole, which occurs when the left ventricle is unable to adequately pump blood out of the heart. The S3 gallop is often described as a ""ventricular gallop"" and is heard after the S2 heart sound. It is best heard with the bell of the stethoscope at the apex of the heart.

The other options are less likely to be present in this patient. A fixed split S2 is typically seen in conditions such as atrial septal defect, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. A loud P2 is associated with pulmonary hypertension, which may be a consequence of long-standing untreated hypertension but is less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's symptoms. An absent S4 is not specific to any particular condition and is not commonly associated with heart failure. A loud S1 is not typically associated with heart failure and is more commonly seen in conditions such as mitral stenosis.",

A medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?""
""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

Options:
(A): It indicates an increased likelihood of bias
(B): It indicates decreased external validity
(C): It indicates a lack of statistical significance
(D): It reflects a smaller sample size
(E): It indicates more narrow confidence intervals
",It reflects a smaller sample size,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): It reflects a smaller sample size.

Explanation: The standard error is a measure of the variability or precision of the sample mean. It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the sample size. A larger standard error indicates greater variability in the data.

In this case, the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. This suggests that there is more variability in the measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group compared to the other groups.

One possible explanation for this increased variability is a smaller sample size in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group. With a smaller sample size, there is a higher chance of random variation affecting the results, leading to greater variability in the measurements. This can result in a larger standard error.

Therefore, the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group likely reflects a smaller sample size in that group.",
"A 63-year-old man with diverticular disease comes to the emergency department because of painless rectal bleeding, dizziness, and lightheadedness for 2 hours.

Options:
(A): Hepatic stellate (Ito) cells
(B): Periportal hepatocytes
(C): Hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells
(D): Hepatic Kupffer cells
(E): Centrilobular hepatocytes
",Centrilobular hepatocytes,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Centrilobular hepatocytes.

Explanation:
The elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) indicate liver cell injury. In this patient, the levels of ALT and AST are significantly elevated, suggesting hepatocellular injury. The pattern of liver enzyme elevation is consistent with centrilobular hepatocyte injury. Centrilobular hepatocytes are located in the central zone of the liver lobule, which is the area closest to the central vein. This area is most susceptible to ischemic injury due to its location farthest from the oxygenated blood supply. In this patient, the severe hypotension and hypoperfusion resulting from the diverticular bleeding likely caused ischemic injury to the centrilobular hepatocytes, leading to their damage and subsequent release of ALT and AST into the bloodstream.",
"A 32-year-old man is brought by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a head-on motor vehicle collision at high speed. The patient was found unconscious by the paramedics and regained consciousness briefly during the ambulance ride. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient’s vitals show: pulse 110/min, respiratory rate 12/min, blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 96%. Physical examination reveals an unresponsive man with multiple bruises across the chest and along the upper arms with a laceration on the forehead. His is unresponsive to verbal commands and physical touch. His GCS is 6/15. The right pupil is fixed and dilated. An urgent noncontrast CT of the head is performed and shown in the image. The patient is prepared for emergency neurosurgery. Which of the following anesthesia medications would be the best option for this patient?
Options:
(A): Propofol
(B): Halothane
(C): Midazolam
(D): Nitrous oxide
(E): Sevoflurane
",Propofol,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Propofol.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is presenting with a severe head injury and signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), such as an unresponsive state, fixed and dilated pupil, and a low Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score. The patient requires urgent neurosurgery, and the anesthesia medication of choice in this situation would be propofol.

Propofol is a short-acting intravenous anesthetic agent that provides rapid induction and smooth emergence from anesthesia. It has a rapid onset of action and a short duration of effect, making it suitable for this emergent situation. Propofol also has the advantage of reducing cerebral metabolic demand and intracranial pressure, which is important in patients with traumatic brain injury.

Halothane (B) is an inhalation anesthetic that is not commonly used in current practice due to its potential for hepatotoxicity and arrhythmogenic effects. It is not the best option for this patient.

Midazolam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can be used for sedation and anxiolysis, but it is not the best choice for induction of anesthesia in this critically ill patient requiring emergency neurosurgery.

Nitrous oxide (D) is a weak anesthetic gas that is commonly used as an adjunct to other anesthetic agents. It is not suitable for rapid induction of anesthesia in this patient with a severe head injury.

Sevoflurane (E) is an inhalation anesthetic that is commonly used for maintenance of anesthesia. However, it is not the best choice for induction of anesthesia in this critically ill patient requiring emergency neurosurgery.

Therefore, the best option for anesthesia in this patient is propofol (A).",
"A 25-year-old female presents to urgent care with complaints of one day of burning and pain with urination, urgency, and frequency. She denies having a fever but has experienced intermittent chills. She is sexually active and inconsistently uses condoms. The patient has no past medical history. She is allergic to sulfa drugs. Physical examination of the genitalia is normal. Urinalysis shows positive leukocyte esterase and nitrites. The urine culture demonstrates gram-negative rods that form pink colonies on MacConkey agar. She is treated with an antibiotic and her symptoms quickly improve. The mechanism of the antibiotic she was most likely treated with is which of the following?
Options:
(A): Inhibits cell wall synthesis
(B): Binds D-ala D-ala in the cell wall
(C): Inhibits initiation complex
(D): Prevents attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA
(E): Inhibits sterol synthesis
",Inhibits cell wall synthesis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Inhibits cell wall synthesis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on urinalysis and urine culture, it is likely that she has a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by gram-negative rods. Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane that contains lipopolysaccharides and peptidoglycan, which are important components of the cell wall. Inhibiting cell wall synthesis is an effective mechanism to target and kill these bacteria.

Option (B) Binds D-ala D-ala in the cell wall is the mechanism of action for glycopeptide antibiotics like vancomycin, which are used to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria. This mechanism is not effective against gram-negative bacteria.

Option (C) Inhibits initiation complex is the mechanism of action for aminoglycoside antibiotics like gentamicin, which are used to treat severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and the findings on urinalysis and urine culture suggest a less severe UTI, and aminoglycosides are not typically used as first-line treatment for UTIs.

Option (D) Prevents attachment of aminoacyl-tRNA is the mechanism of action for tetracycline antibiotics, which are broad-spectrum antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis. While tetracyclines can be used to treat some UTIs, they are not the first-line treatment for gram-negative UTIs.

Option (E) Inhibits sterol synthesis is the mechanism of action for antifungal medications like fluconazole, which are used to treat fungal infections. This mechanism is not effective against bacteria.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action for the antibiotic used to treat this patient's UTI is inhibiting cell wall synthesis.",
"A 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the physician for shortness of breath with mild exertion, progressive weakness, and a dry cough that has persisted for 6 months. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 45 years. His medications include warfarin, enalapril, and amiodarone. His pulse is 85/min and irregularly irregular. Physical examination shows enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails. A CT scan of the chest shows clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea?
Options:
(A): Chronic airway inflammation
(B): Bronchial hyperresponsiveness and obstruction
(C): Fluid leak into the interstitium and alveoli
(D): Pleural scarring
(E): Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung
",Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, as well as the CT scan findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's dyspnea is excess collagen deposition in the extracellular matrix of the lung. 

The patient's history of smoking, along with the presence of enlarged fingertips and markedly curved nails, suggests the possibility of pulmonary fibrosis, which is characterized by excessive collagen deposition in the lung tissue. This can lead to progressive scarring and stiffening of the lung tissue, impairing its ability to expand and contract properly during breathing. 

The CT scan findings of clustered air spaces and reticular opacities in the basal parts of the lung are consistent with the presence of fibrotic changes in the lung tissue. These changes can result in reduced lung compliance and impaired gas exchange, leading to dyspnea with mild exertion.

Chronic airway inflammation (option A) and bronchial hyperresponsiveness and obstruction (option B) are more commonly associated with conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which typically present with symptoms such as wheezing and coughing. The absence of these symptoms, along with the CT scan findings of fibrotic changes, makes these options less likely.

Fluid leak into the interstitium and alveoli (option C) is seen in conditions such as pulmonary edema, which typically presents with symptoms such as frothy sputum and crackles on auscultation. The absence of these symptoms, along with the CT scan findings of fibrotic changes, makes this option less likely.

Pleural scarring (option D) is associated with conditions such as pleural effusion and pleural thickening, which typically present with symptoms such as pleuritic chest pain and decreased breath sounds on auscultation. The absence of these symptoms, along with the CT scan findings of fibrotic changes, makes this option less likely.",
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother after being found lying unconscious next to a bottle of pills. The patient’s mother mentions that he has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder 3 years ago for which he was taking a medication that resulted in only a slight improvement in his symptoms. She says he still found it difficult to concentrate on his studies and did not participate in any social events in college. He didn’t have many friends and was often found sitting alone in his room. He has also threatened to take his life on several occasions, but she did not think he was serious. While recording his vital signs, the patient goes into a coma. His ECG shows a QT interval of 450 milliseconds. Which of the following medications did this patient most likely overdose on?
Options:
(A): Bupropion
(B): Sertraline
(C): Venlafaxine
(D): Citalopram
(E): Clomipramine
",Clomipramine,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Clomipramine.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of being found unconscious after an overdose of pills, along with his history of major depressive disorder and suicidal ideation, suggests a possible intentional overdose. The ECG finding of a prolonged QT interval (450 milliseconds) is significant because it indicates a risk for potentially life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes. 

Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that is known to have a high risk of causing QT interval prolongation. TCAs, including clomipramine, can block cardiac potassium channels, leading to delayed repolarization and prolonged QT interval. This can predispose the patient to ventricular arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes, which can result in syncope, seizures, or even sudden cardiac death.

The other options (A) Bupropion, (B) Sertraline, (C) Venlafaxine, and (D) Citalopram are all antidepressant medications, but they are not typically associated with significant QT interval prolongation. While all medications have potential side effects, clomipramine is specifically known for its cardiac effects and is more likely to cause a prolonged QT interval in overdose situations.",
"In a study to determine the risk factors for myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age (age < 30 years), 30 young patients with the condition are recruited into the study group. Sixty similar but healthy individuals are recruited into the control group. Educational status is considered to be an important variable, as it would affect the awareness of the disease and its risk factors among the participants. Based on the level of education, 2 groups are formed: low educational status and high educational status. A chi-square test is performed to test the significance of the relationship, and an odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7. What inference can be made on the association between young age MI and educational status from this study?
Options:
(A): The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.
(B): The association is statistically significant, but low education is not a risk factor.
(C): The association is not statistically significant, but low education is a risk factor.
(D): One can not comment, as the p-value is not given.
(E): The association is statistically significant, and low education is a risk factor.
","The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.",Correct,"The correct answer is (A): The association is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor.

Explanation:
In this study, a chi-square test was performed to test the significance of the relationship between educational status and the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) at a young age. The odds ratio of 2.1 was computed for the association between low education and the risk of MI, with a confidence interval of 0.9–9.7.

To determine the significance of the association, we need to consider the confidence interval. The confidence interval of 0.9–9.7 indicates that the true odds ratio could range from 0.9 to 9.7. Since the confidence interval includes 1 (the null value), this suggests that the association between low education and the risk of MI is not statistically significant.

Therefore, we can infer that the association between young age MI and educational status is not statistically significant, and low education is not a risk factor for MI in this study.",
"A 32-year-old primigravid woman at 16 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. She is asymptomatic and has no history of serious illness. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F) and blood pressure is 108/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 16-week gestation. A quadruple screening test shows maternal serum AFP of 3 times the median and normal levels of serum β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. Which of the following is most likely to account for these findings?
Options:
(A): Fetal hydrocephalus
(B): Partial molar pregnancy
(C): Neural tube defect
(D): Trisomy 18
(E): Trisomy 21
",Neural tube defect,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Neural tube defect.

Explanation:
The quadruple screening test measures the levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG), estriol, and inhibin A. In this case, the patient has an elevated AFP level of 3 times the median, but normal levels of β-hCG, estriol, and inhibin A. 

Elevated AFP levels are associated with neural tube defects, such as spina bifida or anencephaly. Neural tube defects occur due to incomplete closure of the neural tube during embryonic development. The elevated AFP level is due to leakage of AFP from the fetus into the amniotic fluid and then into the maternal circulation.

Fetal hydrocephalus (choice A) is characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain. It is not associated with elevated AFP levels.

Partial molar pregnancy (choice B) is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease characterized by abnormal placental development. It is not associated with elevated AFP levels.

Trisomy 18 (choice D) and Trisomy 21 (choice E) are chromosomal abnormalities that can be detected through prenatal screening tests, but they are not associated with elevated AFP levels.",
"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of a sharp pain that radiates along his right hemithorax, which worsens with deep inspiration. He says this started abruptly about 6 hours ago. He says that he has not noticed that anything that makes his pain better or worse. He also denies any other symptoms. He works as a long-haul truck driver, and he informs you that he recently returned to the east coast from a trip to Utah. His medical history is significant for gout, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus type 2, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from when he was a child. He currently smokes 2 packs of cigarettes/day, drinks a 6-pack of beer/day, and he denies any illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. His physical examination shows minimal bibasilar rales, but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, normal heart sounds, and a benign abdominal physical examination. Which of the following is the most reasonable 1st step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a low-risk patient?
Options:
(A): ECG
(B): V/Q scan
(C): D-dimer
(D): Lower extremity venous ultrasound
(E): CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast
",D-dimer,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) D-dimer.

Explanation:
In a low-risk patient with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE), the most reasonable first step towards ruling out the diagnosis is to obtain a D-dimer test. D-dimer is a fibrin degradation product that is elevated in the setting of thrombus formation and can be used as a screening tool for PE. A negative D-dimer test has a high negative predictive value and can effectively rule out PE in low-risk patients. 

In this case, the patient presents with a sharp pain that worsens with deep inspiration, which is a common symptom of PE. However, he has no other symptoms or risk factors for PE, and his physical examination is relatively normal. Therefore, he is considered a low-risk patient. 

An ECG (option A) may be helpful in evaluating for other causes of chest pain, such as myocardial infarction or pericarditis, but it is not specific for PE. 

A V/Q scan (option B) and a CT pulmonary angiogram with IV contrast (option E) are both imaging modalities that can definitively diagnose or exclude PE. However, these tests are more invasive and expensive compared to a D-dimer test. They are typically reserved for patients with a high pretest probability of PE or for patients with a positive D-dimer test. 

A lower extremity venous ultrasound (option D) is used to evaluate for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a risk factor for PE. However, in this case, the patient does not have any symptoms or risk factors for DVT, so it is not the most reasonable first step. 

Therefore, the most reasonable first step towards ruling out the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in this low-risk patient is to obtain a D-dimer test.",
"A 47-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of her right hand. Specifically, she says that she was gardening 8 hours prior to presentation when she sustained a laceration over her distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Since then, they have become red and swollen. She has also had pain in her proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints for several years and reports that this pain is worse in the morning but improves over the day. The cells that are present in this patient's DIP joints and PIP joints are analyzed and compared. Which of the following is most likely to be true about this patient's findings?
Options:
(A): DIP has fewer neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP
(B): DIP has fewer neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP
(C): DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP
(D): DIP has more neutrophils and more monocytes than PIP
(E): DIP and PIP have similar numbers of neutrophils and monocytes
",DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) DIP has more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than PIP.

Explanation:
In this patient, the presence of redness, swelling, and pain in the DIP joints after sustaining a laceration suggests an inflammatory response. The DIP joints are specifically affected, which is consistent with the location of the laceration. On the other hand, the patient also reports chronic pain in the PIP joints and MCP joints, which suggests a separate underlying condition.

When comparing the cells present in the DIP joints and PIP joints, it is likely that the DIP joints will have more neutrophils and fewer monocytes than the PIP joints. Neutrophils are the first responders to an acute inflammatory process and are responsible for the initial inflammatory response. Monocytes, on the other hand, are involved in the later stages of inflammation and are responsible for tissue repair and remodeling.

Therefore, the presence of more neutrophils and fewer monocytes in the DIP joints compared to the PIP joints would be consistent with the acute inflammatory response following the laceration.",
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a severe headache. She states it is 10/10 in intensity and states that it is associated with chewing. She describes it as a dull pain over the sides of her head. The patient is otherwise healthy and is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 97.0°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 111/74 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that is worsened when the patient opens and closes their mouth. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Migraine headache
(B): Subarachnoid hemorrhage
(C): Temporal arteritis
(D): Temporomandibular joint dysfunction
(E): Tension headache
",Temporomandibular joint dysfunction,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Temporomandibular joint dysfunction.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of severe headache associated with chewing, dull pain over the sides of the head, and pain and tenderness over the mandibular and temporal region that worsens with opening and closing the mouth are consistent with temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ dysfunction). TMJ dysfunction is a common condition characterized by pain and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, which connects the jawbone to the skull. It can be caused by various factors, including jaw clenching, teeth grinding, trauma, or malalignment of the joint. The pain in TMJ dysfunction can radiate to the temples and cause headaches. Other symptoms may include jaw clicking or popping, difficulty opening or closing the mouth, and muscle tenderness. The absence of other concerning symptoms, such as fever, altered mental status, or neurological deficits, makes more serious conditions like subarachnoid hemorrhage or temporal arteritis less likely. Migraine headaches typically present with a pulsating or throbbing quality, and tension headaches are usually described as a band-like pressure around the head.",
"Twelve hours after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, a 36-year-old man has shortness of breath. He has asthma well controlled with an albuterol inhaler. His father died of lung cancer at 62 years of age. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 14 years. He does not drink alcohol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 122/76 mm Hg. Examination shows reduced breath sounds over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There is a clean, dry surgical incision over the midline of the abdomen. Bowel sounds are hypoactive. The calves are soft and nontender. His hemoglobin concentration is 12.9 g/dL, leukocyte count is 10,600/mm3, and platelet count is 230,000/mm3. An x-ray of the chest in supine position is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Asthma exacerbation
(B): Pneumonitis
(C): Pulmonary embolism
(D): Atelectasis
(E): Congestive heart failure
",Atelectasis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Atelectasis.

Explanation:
Atelectasis refers to the collapse or closure of a lung or a part of a lung. It can occur due to various reasons, including postoperative complications. In this case, the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy for a perforated duodenal ulcer, which is a surgical procedure involving the abdomen. The reduced breath sounds over the left lung base and the presence of a clean, dry surgical incision over the midline of the abdomen suggest that the patient may have developed atelectasis.

Other options can be ruled out based on the information provided:
(A) Asthma exacerbation: Although the patient has a history of asthma, the symptoms and findings on examination (reduced breath sounds over the left lung base) are not consistent with an asthma exacerbation.
(B) Pneumonitis: Pneumonitis refers to inflammation of the lung tissue. There is no evidence of inflammation or infection based on the information provided.
(C) Pulmonary embolism: Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of the pulmonary artery by a blood clot. The patient's symptoms and findings on examination are not consistent with a pulmonary embolism. Additionally, there is no mention of risk factors for pulmonary embolism in the patient's history.
(E) Congestive heart failure: There are no findings on cardiac examination to suggest congestive heart failure. Additionally, the patient's vital signs and absence of lower extremity edema make congestive heart failure less likely.",
"A 62-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 40 minutes after his wife noticed during breakfast that the left side of his face was drooping. He had difficulty putting on his shirt and shoes before coming to the hospital. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. He drinks one glass of wine daily. He is alert and oriented to time, place and person. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 99/min and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows equal and reactive pupils. There is drooping of the left side of the face. Muscle strength is decreased in the left upper and lower extremities. Plantar reflex shows an extensor response on the left side. Speech is dysarthric. There is a bruit on the right side of the neck. Fundoscopy shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count, coagulation profile, and serum concentrations of glucose and electrolytes are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): MRI of the brain
(B): Lumbar puncture
(C): Duplex ultrasonography of the neck
(D): Cerebral angiography
(E): CT scan of the head
",CT scan of the head,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) CT scan of the head.

Explanation:
This patient presents with acute onset of facial drooping, difficulty with motor tasks, decreased muscle strength, dysarthria, and an extensor plantar reflex on the left side. These findings are consistent with a contralateral hemispheric (cortical) stroke. The most common cause of ischemic stroke is atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries, which can lead to embolization of a thrombus to the cerebral circulation. The presence of a bruit on the right side of the neck suggests carotid artery disease as the cause of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is a CT scan of the head to evaluate for the presence of an acute intracranial hemorrhage, which would contraindicate the use of thrombolytic therapy.",
"A 24-year-old man, who recently migrated from a developing country, presents to a physician because of a 2-year history of cough, blood in his sputum, fever, and weight loss. His sputum smear and culture confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. His Mantoux test is 2 mm × 3 mm, and his chest radiograph is normal. High-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV-1 and Western blot assay for HIV-1 are positive. His CD4+ T cell count is 90/μL and HIV RNA is 30,000 copies/mL. He is started on a 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in appropriate doses. He becomes sputum smear-negative after 4 weeks and reports significant improvement in symptoms. After another 4 weeks, the physician removes pyrazinamide from the antitubercular regimen and adds antiretroviral therapy (dolutegravir/tenofovir/emtricitabine). After 3 weeks, the patient presents with complaints of fever and significantly increased cough for 3 days. There is no respiratory distress but generalized lymphadenopathy is present. His chest radiograph shows pulmonary infiltrates and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, sputum smear is negative, Mantoux test is 12 mm × 14 mm, CD4+ T cell count is 370/μL, and HIV RNA is 2,900 copies/mL. What is the most appropriate initial step in treatment?
Options:
(A): Stop antiretroviral therapy and continue antitubercular therapy
(B): Change antiretroviral therapy to darunavir/ritonavir plus tenofovir/emtricitabine
(C): Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-pyrazinamide-ethambutol-streptomycin
(D): Change antitubercular therapy to isoniazid-rifampin-ethambutol-streptomycin
(E): Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change
",Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Continue antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with fever, increased cough, generalized lymphadenopathy, and radiographic findings suggestive of worsening pulmonary tuberculosis despite being on antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy. However, it is important to note that the patient's sputum smear is negative, indicating a response to antitubercular therapy. The Mantoux test has also shown an increase in size, which can be a sign of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in patients with HIV infection.

IRIS is an exaggerated immune response to a previously unrecognized infection or a paradoxical worsening of a known infection after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. It commonly occurs in patients with low CD4+ T cell counts who start antiretroviral therapy and experience immune recovery. In this case, the patient's CD4+ T cell count has increased from 90/μL to 370/μL, indicating immune recovery.

The most appropriate initial step in the treatment of IRIS is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change. IRIS is a self-limiting condition that usually resolves with time. It is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs of worsening or complications, and supportive care can be provided as needed.

Stopping antiretroviral therapy or changing the antiretroviral regimen is not recommended in this case, as it may disrupt the patient's HIV treatment and potentially lead to viral rebound and worsening of the overall clinical condition.

Changing the antitubercular therapy to include streptomycin is not indicated in this case, as streptomycin is not routinely used in the treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis. The initial 4-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol is appropriate and should be continued.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial step in treatment is to continue both antitubercular therapy and antiretroviral therapy without any change.",
"A 6-year-old boy presents with fever, malaise, and intense pain in the anterior neck. His vital signs include: body temperature 39.0°C (102.2°F), heart rate 120/min, and respiratory rate 18/min and regular. On physical examination, there is erythema, tenderness and enlargement of the thyroid gland that is worse on the left. Pain is worsened during neck hyperextension and relieved during neck flexion. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits. An ultrasound of the thyroid gland reveals a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Postviral inflammatory process
(B): Pyriform sinus fistula
(C): Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO)
(D): Perithyroidal fibrosis
(E): Autoantibodies to the thyrotropin receptor (TRAb)
",Pyriform sinus fistula,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Pyriform sinus fistula.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the patient presents with fever, malaise, intense pain in the anterior neck, erythema, tenderness, and enlargement of the thyroid gland. The pain is worsened during neck hyperextension and relieved during neck flexion. Thyroid function tests are within normal limits. An ultrasound reveals a unifocal perithyroidal hypoechoic space.

Pyriform sinus fistula is the most likely mechanism underlying this patient's condition. Pyriform sinus fistula is a remnant of the fourth branchial pouch that connects the oropharynx with the thyroid gland. It is predominantly left-sided. In children and young adults, it is the most common cause of acute thyroiditis. The symptoms of acute thyroiditis include sudden onset of neck pain and tenderness, fever, chills, and other signs of infection. The thyroid gland may be enlarged, tender, and asymmetric. Neck pain often radiates to the mandible, ears, or occiput. Neck flexion reduces the severity of the pain, while neck hyperextension worsens it. 

Postviral inflammatory process (A) is not the most likely mechanism in this case because the symptoms and findings are not consistent with a typical postviral inflammatory process. 

Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) (C) is not the most likely mechanism in this case because it is associated with autoimmune thyroiditis, which typically presents with different symptoms and findings, such as lymphocytic infiltration and destruction of thyroid follicles.

Perithyroidal fibrosis (D) is not the most likely mechanism in this case because it does not explain the acute onset of symptoms and the presence of a perithyroidal hypoechoic space on ultrasound.

Autoantibodies to the thyrotropin receptor (TRAb) (E) are associated with Graves' disease, which typically presents with different symptoms and findings, such as hyperthyroidism, diffuse thyroid enlargement, and ophthalmopathy.",
"A 65-year-old previously healthy man presents to the primary care physician with the chief complaint of red colored urine over the past month. He states that he does not experience dysuria. On physical exam there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. With this presentation which is the most likely cause of this patient's hematuria?
Options:
(A): Bladder tumor
(B): Renal cell carcinoma
(C): Beeturia
(D): Urinary tract infection
(E): Urethral injury
",Bladder tumor,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bladder tumor.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is a 65-year-old man with red colored urine and no dysuria. The absence of costovertebral angle tenderness suggests that the source of hematuria is not from the kidneys. Bladder tumor is the most likely cause of hematuria in this patient, especially considering his age. Renal cell carcinoma (choice B) is less likely because there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Beeturia (choice C) refers to the reddish discoloration of urine after consuming beets and is not a cause of persistent hematuria. Urinary tract infection (choice D) typically presents with dysuria, which the patient does not have. Urethral injury (choice E) would be less likely in the absence of trauma or other symptoms suggestive of injury.",
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother with confusion, abdominal pain, and vomiting for the previous day. The patient’s mother says he started complaining of pain in his abdomen after he got back from school yesterday and vomited 3 times during the night. This morning, he seemed confused so she rushed him to the ER. She has also noticed that he has been urinating frequently and drinking a lot of water recently, and he has lost 6 kg (13.2 lb) over the past 20 days. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/50 mm Hg, heart rate 110/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and temperature 35.6°C (96.0°F). His BMI is 18 kg/m2. On physical examination, he is disoriented to time and place and is taking deep and labored breaths. There is diffuse tenderness to palpation in the abdomen with guarding. Laboratory tests are significant for a pH of 7.19 and a blood glucose level of 754 mg/dL. The doctor explains to his mother that her son has developed a life-threatening complication of a disease characterized by decreased levels of a hormone. Which of the following would you most likely expect to see in this patient?
Options:
(A): Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes
(B): Decreased activity of hormone sensitive lipase
(C): Decreased proteolysis
(D): Increased lipoprotein lipase activity
(E): Decreased glucose uptake by brain cells
",Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, he is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening complication of diabetes mellitus. DKA is characterized by decreased levels of insulin, which leads to increased blood glucose levels and subsequent metabolic derangements.

In DKA, there is a deficiency of insulin, which is responsible for facilitating glucose uptake by various tissues, including adipocytes (fat cells). Without insulin, adipocytes cannot take up glucose efficiently, leading to decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes.

This decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes results in increased lipolysis (breakdown of fats) and release of free fatty acids into the bloodstream. These free fatty acids are then converted to ketone bodies in the liver, leading to the characteristic ketosis seen in DKA.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient would be decreased glucose uptake by adipocytes, as seen in option (A).",
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department because of worsening abdominal pain for the past 2 days. She reports nausea and vomiting and is unable to tolerate oral intake. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38.1°C (100.6°F), the pulse is 92/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 132/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows yellowish discoloration of her sclera. Her abdomen is tender in the right upper quadrant. There is no abdominal distention or organomegaly. The laboratory tests show the following results:
Hemoglobin 13 g/dL
Leukocyte count 16,000/mm3
Urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL
Creatinine 2 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase 432 U/L
Alanine aminotransferase 196 U/L

Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant shows dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder. The pancreas is not well visualized. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone and metronidazole are initiated. After 12 hours, the patient appears acutely ill and is not oriented to time. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), the pulse is 105/min, the respirations are 22/min, and the blood pressure is 112/82 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan
(B): Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
(C): Laparoscopic cholecystectomy
(D): Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
(E): Percutaneous cholecystostomy
",Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP),Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholangitis, which is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, and evidence of biliary obstruction. The laboratory findings of elevated alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and bilirubin levels further support this diagnosis. The ultrasound findings of dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and multiple hyperechoic spheres within the gallbladder are suggestive of choledocholithiasis, which is a common cause of acute cholangitis.

The patient's worsening clinical condition with an acute change in mental status, along with the persistent fever, tachycardia, and hypotension, suggests the development of severe cholangitis or cholangitis-associated sepsis. In this setting, urgent intervention is required to relieve biliary obstruction and control the infection.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the most appropriate next step in management. ERCP allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. It can be used to identify and remove common bile duct stones, which is the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, ERCP can be used to place a biliary stent to relieve biliary obstruction and facilitate drainage of infected bile. This procedure can be performed urgently and is associated with a high success rate in resolving the biliary obstruction and controlling the infection.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan (A) may provide additional information about the extent of the biliary obstruction and the presence of complications such as abscess formation, but it does not provide a definitive treatment for the underlying cause.

Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (C) is the definitive treatment for symptomatic cholelithiasis but is not indicated in the acute setting of cholangitis. It is typically performed after the resolution of the acute infection.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) (D) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed images of the biliary tree. However, in the setting of acute cholangitis, urgent intervention is required to relieve biliary obstruction and control the infection, which cannot be achieved with MRCP alone.

Percutaneous cholecystostomy (E) is a minimally invasive procedure that involves the placement of a catheter into the gallbladder to drain infected bile. It can be considered in patients who are not candidates for ERCP or in whom ERCP is unsuccessful. However, ERCP is the preferred initial intervention in the management of acute cholangitis.",
"A 62-year-old man presents to his primary care doctor with continued hypertension despite adherence to multiple anti-hypertensive medications. The physician suspects that the patient may have elevated aldosterone levels and wants to initiate a trial of an aldosterone receptor antagonist. The patient is very concerned about side effects, particularly impotence and gynecomastia, as he had a friend who took a similar medication and had these side-effects. Which of the following is the best medication to initiate, given his concerns and the physician's diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Spironolactone
(B): Eplerenone
(C): Amiloride
(D): Triamterene
(E): Ethacrynic acid
",Eplerenone,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Eplerenone.

Explanation:
Eplerenone is the best medication to initiate in this case, given the patient's concerns about side effects and the physician's diagnosis of elevated aldosterone levels. Eplerenone is a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist that does not block the androgen receptor, unlike spironolactone. This means that eplerenone is less likely to cause side effects such as impotence and gynecomastia. It is the drug of choice for long-term treatment in men if low-dose spironolactone is ineffective.

Spironolactone (option A) is also an aldosterone receptor antagonist, but it is a nonselective antagonist that can block the androgen receptor, leading to side effects such as impotence and gynecomastia. While spironolactone can be effective in treating hypertension, eplerenone is preferred in this case due to the patient's concerns about side effects.

Amiloride (option C) and triamterene (option D) are potassium-sparing diuretics, but they are not aldosterone receptor antagonists. They are alternative options for patients intolerant of spironolactone and eplerenone, but they are not the best initial choice in this case.

Ethacrynic acid (option E) is a loop diuretic and is not an aldosterone receptor antagonist. It is not indicated for the treatment of elevated aldosterone levels and hypertension in this case.",
"A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a recent episode of chest pain. She says she was previously well and denies any history of similar symptoms. She reports that, at onset, she felt as if she was going to die and says her heart beating has been beating really fast. There was also profuse sweating, and she says she feels short of breath. She could not recall how long the event lasted but can remember that the symptoms did go away on their own by the time she arrived at the emergency department. Her vitals rapidly returned to normal while giving her medical history and she begins to look and act more calm. No significant past medical history or current medications.  Physical examination is unremarkable. Her electrocardiogram and initial cardiac enzymes are normal. Which the following is necessary to confirm the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): 1 month of associated symptoms 
(B): Average of 1 disruptive event per week
(C): Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions
(D): Family history
(E): Agoraphobia
",1 month of associated symptoms ,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): 1 month of associated symptoms.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of chest pain, feeling as if she was going to die, rapid heart rate, profuse sweating, and shortness of breath, the most likely diagnosis is panic disorder. Panic disorder is characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, which are sudden episodes of intense fear or discomfort that reach a peak within minutes. These attacks are often accompanied by physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, and fear of losing control or dying.

To confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder, the patient must have experienced at least one month of associated symptoms, such as persistent worry about having additional attacks, significant behavioral changes related to the attacks, or a maladaptive change in behavior to avoid panic attacks or their consequences. This criterion is necessary to differentiate panic disorder from other conditions that may present with similar symptoms, such as cardiac or respiratory disorders.

Option (B): Average of 1 disruptive event per week is not the correct answer because the frequency of panic attacks alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder. The duration and associated symptoms are also important factors.

Option (C): Disruptive events lasting > 30 minutes on 2 separate occasions is not the correct answer because the duration of the panic attacks alone is not sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of panic disorder. The associated symptoms and duration of symptoms over a period of one month are also important factors.

Option (D): Family history is not the correct answer because although a family history of panic disorder may increase the risk of developing the condition, it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this patient. The diagnosis of panic disorder is based on the patient's symptoms and duration of symptoms.

Option (E): Agoraphobia is not the correct answer because although agoraphobia is commonly associated with panic disorder, it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this patient. Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder characterized by a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack or other embarrassing or incapacitating symptoms.",
"A previously healthy 14-year-old boy is brought to the physician for evaluation because of loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and extreme irritability for the past 3 weeks. He was recently kicked off of the school's football team after missing too many practices. He has also been avoiding his family and friends because he is not in the mood to see them, but he admits that he is lonely. He has not left his room for 2 days, which prompted his father to bring him to the physician. He has no medical conditions and does not take any medications. He does not drink alcohol or use recreational drugs. While the father is in the waiting room, a mental status examination is conducted, which shows a constricted affect. Cognition is intact. He says that he would be better off dead and refuses to be treated. He says he wants to use his father's licensed firearm to “end his misery” over the weekend when his parents are at church. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Agree to his wish for no further treatment
(B): Begin paroxetine therapy
(C): Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents
(D): Reassure the patient that he will feel better
(E): Start outpatient psychotherapy
",Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder, including loss of appetite, sleeplessness, extreme irritability, social withdrawal, and suicidal ideation. The fact that he expresses a desire to use his father's firearm to ""end his misery"" is a serious concern and indicates a high risk for self-harm. In this case, the most appropriate next step in management is involuntary hospitalization after informing the parents.

Involuntary hospitalization is necessary when a patient poses a significant risk to themselves or others. In this case, the patient's suicidal ideation and access to a firearm make him a high-risk individual. Informing the parents is important to ensure their involvement in the patient's care and to provide them with the necessary information and support.

Agreeing to the patient's wish for no further treatment (option A) is not appropriate because it would neglect the patient's safety and well-being. The patient's suicidal ideation requires immediate intervention.

Beginning paroxetine therapy (option B) may be a treatment option for major depressive disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's immediate safety is the priority, and hospitalization is necessary to address the risk of self-harm.

Reassuring the patient that he will feel better (option D) is not appropriate in this situation. The patient's symptoms are severe and he is expressing suicidal ideation. Reassurance alone is not sufficient and immediate intervention is necessary.

Starting outpatient psychotherapy (option E) may be a treatment option for major depressive disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's immediate safety is the priority, and hospitalization is necessary to address the risk of self-harm.",
"A previously healthy 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of generalized malaise and a palpable swelling in the left axilla. The parents report that 2 weeks ago, his daycare group visited an animal shelter, after which he developed a rash on the left hand. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F). Physical examination shows three linear crusts on an erythematous background on the dorsum of the left hand. There is tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of an axillary lymph node shows necrotizing granulomas. The most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Bacillary angiomatosis
(B): Burkitt lymphoma
(C): Condylomata lata
(D): Brucellosis
(E): Bubonic plague
",Bacillary angiomatosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bacillary angiomatosis.

Explanation:
The clinical findings in this patient, including the rash on the left hand, tender left-sided axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy, and histopathologic examination showing necrotizing granulomas, are consistent with bacillary angiomatosis. Bacillary angiomatosis is caused by infection with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana, which are gram-negative bacilli. These organisms are also involved in the pathogenesis of cat scratch disease, which can present with similar clinical findings. Cat scratch disease typically occurs after a scratch or bite from a cat, and is characterized by regional lymphadenopathy, fever, and a papule or pustule at the site of inoculation. In this case, the patient's exposure to an animal shelter suggests possible exposure to cats, which could have led to infection with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. Therefore, the most likely causal organism of this patient's clinical findings is also involved in the pathogenesis of cat scratch disease, or bacillary angiomatosis.",
"A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe dyspnea and a productive cough containing streaks of blood since the day before. He had a sudden pruritic papular rash on his right thigh when he was in the southwestern USA hiking in northern Arizona and New Mexico. The next day he developed severely painful inguinal swelling on the same side; however, he did not see a physician and controlled the pain with painkillers. There is no other history of serious illness. He does not take any other medications. He appears confused. The temperature is 39.5℃ (103.1℉), the pulse is 105/min, the respiration rate is 32/min, and the blood pressure is 95/45 mm Hg. Rales are heard in the lower lobe of the left lung on auscultation. The right inguinal lymph nodes are enlarged with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core. The surrounding area is edematous without overlying erythema or cellulitis. A computerized tomography (CT) scan is shown in the picture. Which of the following best explains these findings?
Options:
(A): Lyme disease
(B): Malaria
(C): Plague
(D): Tick typhus
(E): Legionnaire's disease
",Plague,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Plague.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with bubonic plague, which is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis. The patient's history of hiking in the southwestern USA, specifically in northern Arizona and New Mexico, is significant because these areas are known to have endemic plague. The sudden pruritic papular rash on the right thigh followed by severely painful inguinal swelling on the same side are classic findings in bubonic plague. The enlarged inguinal lymph nodes with a spongy consistency and an underlying hard core further support this diagnosis. The patient's dyspnea, productive cough with streaks of blood, and rales in the lower lobe of the left lung suggest secondary pneumonic plague, which can occur when the infection spreads to the lungs. The patient's confusion and vital signs (elevated temperature, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension) are consistent with severe sepsis, which can occur in cases of plague. The CT scan may show findings such as pulmonary infiltrates or pleural effusions, which are common in pneumonic plague. Overall, the patient's clinical presentation, history, and imaging findings are most consistent with bubonic plague.",
"A 44-year-old man presents to the family medicine clinic for some small bumps on his left thigh. The lesions are non-pruritic and have been present for the last 3 weeks. He reports feeling fatigued and malaise for the past few months. The patient has no known medical problems and takes no medications. He smokes one pack of cigarettes per day and uses intravenous street drugs. His heart rate is 82/min, the respiratory rate is 14/min, the temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), and the blood pressure is 126/80 mm Hg. Auscultation of the heart is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Three 2-3 mm, dome-shaped, hardened papules are noted on the left thigh. Central umbilication can be observed in each papule. There is a non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Kaposi sarcoma
(B): Bed bug bite
(C): Molluscum contagiosum
(D): Atopic dermatitis
(E): Acute urticaria
",Molluscum contagiosum,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Molluscum contagiosum.

Explanation:
Molluscum contagiosum is a viral skin infection caused by the poxvirus. It is commonly seen in children but can also occur in adults, especially those with weakened immune systems. The presentation of small, dome-shaped papules with central umbilication is classic for molluscum contagiosum. These papules are usually painless and non-pruritic. The presence of cervical lymphadenopathy suggests systemic involvement and a possible immunocompromised state in this patient. 

Kaposi sarcoma (choice A) is a malignancy associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection. It typically presents as violaceous, raised lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. It is more commonly seen in patients with HIV/AIDS or other immunosuppressive conditions.

Bed bug bites (choice B) typically present as itchy, red, raised bumps that may be arranged in a linear pattern. The lesions are usually not hardened or dome-shaped, and central umbilication is not seen.

Atopic dermatitis (choice D) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by pruritic, erythematous, and scaly patches. It is commonly seen in individuals with a personal or family history of atopy, such as asthma or allergic rhinitis. The presentation does not match the description given in the question.

Acute urticaria (choice E) is a transient skin condition characterized by the sudden onset of pruritic, raised wheals. It is often caused by an allergic reaction to medications, foods, or insect bites. The lesions of acute urticaria are typically not dome-shaped or hardened, and central umbilication is not seen.",
"A prominent male politician has secret homosexual desires. However, rather than engaging in homosexual behavior, he holds rallies against gay rights and regularly criticizes gay people. The politician is displaying which of the following defense mechanisms?
Options:
(A): Repression
(B): Reaction formation
(C): Denial
(D): Displacement
(E): Sublimation
",Reaction formation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Reaction formation.

Explanation:
Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which a person consciously expresses thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that are the opposite of their true desires or impulses. In this case, the politician has secret homosexual desires but instead of acknowledging or accepting them, he engages in rallies against gay rights and criticizes gay people. This behavior is a way for him to counteract or suppress his true desires by expressing the opposite viewpoint.",
"A 55-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a general checkup. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation and is currently taking warfarin, insulin, lisinopril, and metoprolol. The patient’s brother recently died from a heart attack and he has switched to an all vegetarian diet in order to improve his health. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient’s physical exam is unremarkable. His laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 12 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 7,550/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 197,000/mm^3
INR: 1.0

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best explanation for this patient’s laboratory values?
Options:
(A): Dietary changes
(B): Increased hepatic metabolism
(C): Increased renal clearance
(D): Laboratory error
(E): Medication noncompliance
",Dietary changes,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Dietary changes.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory values are within normal range, indicating that there is no evidence of increased hepatic metabolism, increased renal clearance, laboratory error, or medication noncompliance. The most likely explanation for the patient's laboratory values is the recent dietary changes. Switching to an all vegetarian diet can have an impact on various laboratory values. For example, a vegetarian diet may lead to lower levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit due to reduced intake of iron, which is primarily found in animal products. Additionally, a vegetarian diet may affect electrolyte levels, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride, as well as other metabolic parameters like glucose and calcium. Therefore, the best explanation for this patient's laboratory values is dietary changes.",
"A 20-year-old woman in the army recruit collapses during an especially hot day at basic training. She was in her normal excellent state of health prior to this event. Two weeks ago, she had an upper respiratory infection (URI) but has since recovered. Her father has chronic kidney disease (CKD), bilateral hearing loss, and vision problems. At the hospital, her temperature is 40.3°C (104.5°F), blood pressure is 85/55 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to have altered mental status and her skin is dry, hot, and erythematous. She is complaining of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia. Catheterization produces 200 mL of tea-colored urine. Urine dipstick is positive for blood, but urinalysis is negative for RBCs or WBCs. Which of the following is most likely responsible for her condition?
Options:
(A): A mutation of the COL4A5 gene
(B): Neisseria meningitides
(C): Heat exhaustion
(D): Heat stroke
(E): IgA nephropathy
",Heat stroke,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Heat stroke.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with heat stroke, which is a severe form of heat-related illness. Heat stroke occurs when the body's thermoregulatory mechanisms fail to maintain normal body temperature, resulting in a core body temperature above 40°C (104°F). 

The patient's collapse during a hot day at basic training, along with the presence of altered mental status, dry and hot skin, and a high temperature of 40.3°C (104.5°F), are all indicative of heat stroke. The patient's symptoms of severe bilateral flank pain and generalized myalgia can be attributed to the muscle breakdown that occurs in heat stroke, known as rhabdomyolysis. 

The patient's tea-colored urine and positive urine dipstick for blood suggest the presence of hematuria, which can occur in heat stroke due to the breakdown of red blood cells. The absence of red blood cells or white blood cells on urinalysis is consistent with the diagnosis of heat stroke, as the hematuria is caused by the breakdown of red blood cells rather than inflammation or infection.

The other options are not likely responsible for the patient's condition:
(A) A mutation of the COL4A5 gene is associated with Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that primarily affects the kidneys and can cause hematuria, but it does not present with the characteristic symptoms of heat stroke.
(B) Neisseria meningitidis is a bacterium that can cause meningitis, but it does not explain the patient's symptoms of heat stroke.
(C) Heat exhaustion is a milder form of heat-related illness characterized by dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, but it does not cause the severe symptoms seen in heat stroke.
(E) IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the glomeruli, leading to hematuria, but it does not explain the patient's symptoms of heat stroke.",
"A 60-year-old man with a long-standing history of chronic hepatitis C infection comes to the emergency department because of abdominal distention and scleral icterus for the past month. His heart rate is 76/min, respiratory rate is 14/min, temperature is 36.0°C (96.8°F), and blood pressure is 110/86 mm Hg. Physical examination show signs suggestive of liver cirrhosis. Which of the following signs is a direct result of hyperestrinism in cirrhotic patients?
Options:
(A): Coagulopathy
(B): Gynecomastia
(C): Jaundice
(D): Lower limb swelling
(E): Caput medusae
",Gynecomastia,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Gynecomastia.

Explanation:
Gynecomastia is a direct result of hyperestrinism in cirrhotic patients. In male patients with cirrhosis, particularly that related to alcohol use, signs of hyperestrogenemia such as gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, and loss of male-pattern hair distribution may be found. Hyperestrinism occurs in cirrhosis due to impaired liver function, which leads to decreased clearance of estrogen. This results in an imbalance between estrogen and androgen levels, leading to the development of gynecomastia. Gynecomastia is the enlargement of breast tissue in males and is a common finding in cirrhotic patients.",
"A 47-year-old woman seeks evaluation at your office because she has had postcoital vaginal bleeding for the past 8 months with occasional intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge. Her family history is negative for malignancies and inherited disorders. She is the result of a pregnancy complicated by numerous miscarriages in the 1960s, for which her mother received diethylstilbestrol. During a pelvic examination, you notice a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina. The bimanual examination is negative for adnexal masses. You suspect the presence of carcinoma and, therefore, send tissue samples to pathology, which confirmed the presence of malignant cells. Which of the following is the most likely malignant tumor in this patient?
Options:
(A): Clear cell adenocarcinoma
(B): Melanoma
(C): Botryoid sarcoma
(D): Verrucous carcinoma
(E): Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)
",Clear cell adenocarcinoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Clear cell adenocarcinoma.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero and the presence of a polypoid mass on the anterior wall of the vagina, the most likely malignant tumor in this patient is clear cell adenocarcinoma. Clear cell adenocarcinoma is a rare form of vaginal malignancy that occurs most often in females who were exposed to DES in utero. DES was a synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women between the 1940s and 1970s to prevent miscarriages. However, it was later discovered that DES exposure in utero can lead to various health issues, including clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina.

The patient's symptoms of postcoital vaginal bleeding and intermenstrual watery, blood-tinged vaginal discharge are also consistent with clear cell adenocarcinoma. Other potential malignant tumors, such as melanoma, botryoid sarcoma, verrucous carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Therefore, the most likely malignant tumor in this patient is clear cell adenocarcinoma.",
"A 35-year-old man visits your office for his annual health checkup. He was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder 6 months ago, which is being treated with citalopram. He comments that his symptoms have improved since initiating the prescribed therapy; however, in the past 2 months, he has been unable to have sexual intercourse due to weak tumescence and low libido. His blood pressure is 122/74 mm Hg, heart rate is 75/min, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals regular heart and lung sounds. What is the appropriate step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Lowering citalopram dose
(B): Addition of bupropion
(C): Switch to fluoxetine
(D): Addition of sildenafil
(E): Switch to selegiline
",Lowering citalopram dose,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Lowering citalopram dose.

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing sexual dysfunction, specifically weak tumescence and low libido, which are known side effects of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) commonly used to treat generalized anxiety disorder. Lowering the dose of citalopram is the appropriate step in managing this patient's symptoms. It is important to note that sexual dysfunction is a common side effect of SSRIs and can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. By reducing the dose of citalopram, the aim is to minimize the side effects while still maintaining the therapeutic benefits for the patient's anxiety disorder. It is important to monitor the patient's symptoms and adjust the medication as needed to find the optimal balance between symptom control and minimizing side effects.",
"A 63-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. During this period, the patient has had recurrent episodes of high-grade fever, night sweats, and feelings of fatigue. Two months ago, he had herpes zoster that was treated with acyclovir. He appears pale. Temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows generalized painless lymphadenopathy. The liver and the spleen are palpated 2–3 cm below the right and the left costal margin, respectively. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 42%

Segmented neutrophils 46%
Eosinophils 1%
Lymphocytes 50%
Monocytes 3%
Platelet count 120,000/mm3
Blood smear shows mature lymphocytes that rupture easily and appear as artifacts on a blood smear. Flow cytometry shows lymphocytes expressing CD5, CD19, CD20, and CD23. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?""
Options:
(A): Chlorambucil only
(B): All-trans retinoic acid
(C): Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab
(D): Observation and disease progression monitoring
(E): Imatinib only
""
","Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab",Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a neoplastic disorder characterized by the accumulation of mature-appearing lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. The presence of generalized painless lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and weight loss are consistent with advanced disease.

The treatment of CLL depends on the stage and risk stratification of the disease. In this case, the patient has advanced disease with symptoms and organomegaly, indicating the need for treatment. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). FCR is the standard first-line treatment for physically fit patients with CLL and has been shown to improve overall survival compared to other treatment options.

Chlorambucil (option A) is an alkylating agent that can be used in the treatment of CLL, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient with advanced disease.

All-trans retinoic acid (option B) is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), not CLL. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are not consistent with APL.

Observation and disease progression monitoring (option D) is not appropriate for this patient with advanced disease and symptoms.

Imatinib (option E) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), not CLL. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are not consistent with CML.",
"A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency room with chest pain. He developed severe, crushing, substernal chest pain 10 hours ago while he was hiking in the Adirondack mountains. He was with 2 friends at the time who gave him aspirin before carrying him 5 miles to a town to get phone service, where they then called emergency medical services. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. He takes enalapril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has a 20-pack-year smoking history and is an avid hiker. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 102/60 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He is diaphoretic and intermittently conscious. Bilateral rales are heard on pulmonary auscultation. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I and aVL. Despite appropriate management, the patient expires. An autopsy is performed demonstrating ischemia in the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Which of the following vessels was most likely affected in this patient?
Options:
(A): Left anterior descending artery
(B): Left circumflex artery
(C): Left coronary artery
(D): Posterior descending artery
(E): Right marginal artery
",Left circumflex artery,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Left circumflex artery.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and autopsy findings, the most likely vessel affected in this patient is the left circumflex artery. The patient's symptoms of severe, crushing, substernal chest pain, along with the ST elevations in leads I and aVL on the electrocardiogram, are consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). The left circumflex artery is one of the main branches of the left coronary artery and supplies blood to the lateral wall of the left ventricle, including the left atrium and posterior left ventricle. Ischemia in these areas suggests that the left circumflex artery was affected.

The other options can be ruled out based on the patient's presentation and autopsy findings:
- The left anterior descending artery (option A) supplies blood to the anterior wall of the left ventricle and is not typically associated with ischemia in the left atrium or posterior left ventricle.
- The left coronary artery (option C) is a general term that includes both the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex artery. While the left coronary artery as a whole may be affected in a myocardial infarction, the specific findings in this patient point to the left circumflex artery.
- The posterior descending artery (option D) supplies blood to the posterior wall of the left ventricle and is not typically associated with ischemia in the left atrium or posterior left ventricle.
- The right marginal artery (option E) supplies blood to the right ventricle and is not typically associated with ischemia in the left atrium or posterior left ventricle.",
"A 61-year-old man comes to the physician with several months of sharp, shooting pain in both legs. Twenty years ago, he had a painless ulcer on his penis that resolved without treatment. He has no history of serious illness. Examination shows small pupils that constrict with accommodation but do not react to light. Sensation to pinprick and light touch is decreased over the distal lower extremities. Patellar reflexes are absent bilaterally. His gait is unsteady and broad-based. This patient is at increased risk for which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Atrioventricular block
(B): Mitral valve regurgitation
(C): Penile squamous cell carcinoma
(D): Inflammatory polyarthritis
(E): Thoracic aortic aneurysm
",Thoracic aortic aneurysm,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Thoracic aortic aneurysm.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with neurosyphilis, which is a late manifestation of untreated syphilis. Neurosyphilis can affect the cardiovascular system, leading to the development of aortic aneurysms. The thoracic aorta is the most commonly affected site. The risk of aortic aneurysm formation is increased in patients with neurosyphilis due to the inflammation and weakening of the vessel wall caused by the infection. Therefore, this patient is at increased risk for thoracic aortic aneurysm. 

Option (A) Atrioventricular block is not associated with neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis primarily affects the central nervous system and does not typically involve the cardiac conduction system.

Option (B) Mitral valve regurgitation is not associated with neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis primarily affects the central nervous system and does not typically involve the heart valves.

Option (C) Penile squamous cell carcinoma is not associated with neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis primarily affects the central nervous system and does not typically lead to the development of penile cancer.

Option (D) Inflammatory polyarthritis is not associated with neurosyphilis. Neurosyphilis primarily affects the central nervous system and does not typically cause joint inflammation.",
"A 55-year-old woman presents with severe pruritus and fatigue. She denies any similar symptoms in the past. No significant past medical history. Upon physical examination, scleral icterus is present, and significant hepatosplenomegaly is noted. Mild peripheral edema is also present. Laboratory findings are significant for elevated serum levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), immunoglobulins, as well as cholesterol (especially HDL fraction). Antiviral antibodies are not present. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is also elevated. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are found. A liver biopsy is performed, and the histopathologic examination shows bile duct injury, cholestasis, and granuloma formation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Primary biliary cirrhosis
(B): Hemolytic anemia
(C): Hepatitis A
(D): Gilbert syndrome
(E): Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I
",Primary biliary cirrhosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Primary biliary cirrhosis.

Explanation:
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts. It primarily affects middle-aged women. The most common presenting symptoms are fatigue and pruritus. Other symptoms may include hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and peripheral edema. Laboratory findings in PBC typically show elevated serum levels of bilirubin, aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP). Immunoglobulins, especially IgM, are also elevated. Cholesterol levels, particularly the HDL fraction, may be increased. The presence of anti-mitochondrial antibodies is highly specific for PBC. Liver biopsy findings in PBC include bile duct injury, cholestasis, and granuloma formation. Hemolytic anemia, hepatitis A, Gilbert syndrome, and Crigler–Najjar syndrome type I are not consistent with the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described in this patient.",
"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unconscious. He was at a college party exhibiting belligerent behavior when he suddenly passed out and fell to the ground. His past medical history is not known. His temperature is 100°F (37.8°C), blood pressure is 107/48 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient is covered with emesis and responds incoherently to questions. As the patient begins to wake up he continues vomiting. The patient is started on IV fluids, analgesics, and anti-emetics and begins to feel better. Thirty minutes later the patient presents with muscle rigidity and is no longer responding coherently to questions. His temperature is 103°F (39.4°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 125/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient's basic laboratory studies are drawn and he is started on IV fluids, given lorazepam, and placed under a cooling blanket. Despite these initial measures, his symptoms persist. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Acetaminophen
(B): Dantrolene
(C): Diazepam
(D): Intubation
(E): Supportive therapy
",Dantrolene,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Dantrolene.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with muscle rigidity and altered mental status after receiving lorazepam and being placed under a cooling blanket is consistent with malignant hyperthermia (MH). MH is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by hypermetabolism of skeletal muscle in response to certain triggering agents, such as volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine. The classic signs of MH include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnea, and acidosis. The initial management of MH involves discontinuation of the triggering agent, administration of dantrolene, and supportive care. Dantrolene is a skeletal muscle relaxant that acts by inhibiting calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing muscle contractility and heat production. It is the treatment of choice for MH and should be administered as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. Acetaminophen is not indicated in the management of MH. Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used as an adjunctive treatment for muscle rigidity, but it is not the primary treatment for MH. Intubation may be necessary if the patient develops respiratory compromise, but it is not the next best step in management. Supportive therapy is important in the management of MH, but it is not the next best step in management.",
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of pain in his right knee for the past week. The pain is exacerbated by jogging and climbing up stairs. He has no history of trauma to the knee. He is otherwise healthy. He is an active member of his school's gymnastics team. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the right knee shows a tender swelling at the proximal tibia; range of motion is full. Knee extension against resistance causes pain in the anterior proximal tibia. The remainder of the examinations shows no abnormalities. X-ray of the right knee shows anterior tibial soft tissue swelling with fragmentation of the tibial tuberosity. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Options:
(A): Administration of oral ketorolac
(B): Perform joint aspiration
(C): Open reduction of the tuberosity
(D): Administration of oral methotrexate
(E): Application of a lower leg cast
""
",Administration of oral ketorolac,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Administration of oral ketorolac.

The patient's presentation is consistent with Osgood-Schlatter disease, which is a common cause of knee pain in active adolescents. Osgood-Schlatter disease is an overuse injury that occurs at the tibial tuberosity, where the patellar tendon inserts. It typically presents with pain and swelling over the tibial tuberosity, which is exacerbated by activities such as running, jumping, and climbing stairs.

The initial management of Osgood-Schlatter disease is conservative and focuses on pain control and activity modification. Administration of oral ketorolac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is an appropriate first step in managing the patient's pain. NSAIDs help reduce inflammation and relieve pain, allowing the patient to continue with their activities while minimizing discomfort.

Performing joint aspiration (B) is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of joint effusion or infection. Osgood-Schlatter disease primarily affects the tibial tuberosity and does not involve the joint itself.

Open reduction of the tuberosity (C) is not necessary in Osgood-Schlatter disease. This procedure is typically reserved for cases of tibial tuberosity avulsion fractures, which present with more severe pain, inability to bear weight, and limited range of motion. The patient in this case has no evidence of a fracture.

Administration of oral methotrexate (D) is not indicated in Osgood-Schlatter disease. Methotrexate is a medication used in the treatment of autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. It is not appropriate for the management of Osgood-Schlatter disease, which is an overuse injury.

Application of a lower leg cast (E) is not necessary in Osgood-Schlatter disease. Immobilization with a cast is typically reserved for cases of severe pain or inability to bear weight, which are not present in this patient. Conservative management with pain control and activity modification is usually sufficient for Osgood-Schlatter disease.",
"Three days after undergoing an open cholecystectomy, an obese 57-year-old woman has fever, chills, and a headache. She has right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration and has had a productive cough for the last 12 hours. She had an episode of hypotension after the operation that resolved with intravenous fluid therapy. She underwent an abdominal hysterectomy 16 years ago for multiple fibroids of the uterus. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 17 years. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 98/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Inspiratory crackles are heard at the right lung base. The abdomen is soft and nontender. There is a healing surgical incision below the right ribcage. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Pulmonary embolism
(B): Subphrenic abscess
(C): Pneumonia
(D): Atelectasis
(E): Pneumothorax
",Pneumonia,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Pneumonia.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, headache, right-sided chest pain that increases on inspiration, and productive cough are consistent with pneumonia. The presence of crackles on auscultation of the right lung base further supports this diagnosis. Pneumonia is an infection of the lung parenchyma that can occur after surgery, especially in patients who are obese, have a history of smoking, or have had previous abdominal surgery. The patient's history of hypotension after the operation may suggest sepsis, which can be a complication of pneumonia. The absence of abdominal tenderness and the presence of a healing surgical incision below the right ribcage make subphrenic abscess less likely. Pulmonary embolism typically presents with sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis, which are not described in this patient. Atelectasis, which is collapse of lung tissue, can occur after surgery but is less likely given the patient's symptoms of fever, chills, and productive cough. Pneumothorax, which is air in the pleural space, typically presents with sudden-onset dyspnea and pleuritic chest pain, which are not described in this patient.",
"A 55-year-old man presents with a red rash over his face for the last 3 months. The patient says he moved to Nevada 6 months ago because of a new job where he works outdoors; however, he worked indoors in an office before. His vital signs include: blood pressure 100/60 mm Hg, pulse 64/min, respiratory rate 18/min. The patient’s rash is shown in the exhibit. Which of the following is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient?
Options:
(A): Oral tetracycline
(B): Oral clonidine
(C): Topical metronidazole
(D): Topical benzoyl peroxide
(E): Vascular laser
",Topical metronidazole,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Topical metronidazole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of moving to Nevada and working outdoors, along with the appearance of the rash on his face, the most likely diagnosis is rosacea. Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that commonly affects the face, causing redness, flushing, and sometimes small red bumps or pustules.

Topical metronidazole is the best initial step in the treatment of this patient because it is a first-line treatment for rosacea. Metronidazole is an antibiotic with anti-inflammatory properties that helps reduce the redness and inflammation associated with rosacea. It is available in gel, cream, or lotion form and is applied topically to the affected areas of the skin.

Oral tetracycline (option A) is also a treatment option for rosacea, but it is typically reserved for more severe cases or when topical treatments are not effective. Oral clonidine (option B) is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and is not indicated for the treatment of rosacea. Topical benzoyl peroxide (option D) is commonly used to treat acne, but it is not effective for rosacea. Vascular laser (option E) may be used in certain cases of rosacea to target visible blood vessels, but it is not the best initial step in treatment.",
"A previously healthy 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise for the last 6 months. She does not smoke. Her maternal uncle had similar symptoms. Cardiac examination shows wide splitting of S2. The second component of S2 is loud and best heard at the 2nd left intercostal space. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's cardiac findings?
Options:
(A): Increased right ventricular preload
(B): Increased left ventricular preload
(C): Increased right ventricular afterload
(D): Increased left ventricular afterload
(E): Increased left-to-right shunting
",Increased right ventricular afterload,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Increased right ventricular afterload.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain during exercise, along with the cardiac findings of wide splitting of S2 and a loud second component of S2 heard at the 2nd left intercostal space, are consistent with pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, leading to increased afterload on the right ventricle.

Option (A) Increased right ventricular preload is incorrect because increased right ventricular preload would result in a louder first component of S2, not the second component.

Option (B) Increased left ventricular preload is incorrect because left ventricular preload does not directly affect the splitting of S2 or the loudness of the second component.

Option (D) Increased left ventricular afterload is incorrect because the symptoms and findings described are more consistent with right ventricular afterload, not left ventricular afterload.

Option (E) Increased left-to-right shunting is incorrect because the symptoms and findings described are not consistent with a shunt between the left and right sides of the heart.",
"An 11-year-old boy presents to your office with pitting edema and proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours. You suspect that this patient has experienced a loss of polyanions in his glomerular basement membranes. Which of the following findings would confirm your diagnosis?
Options:
(A): WBC casts in the urine
(B): RBC casts in the urine
(C): Selective albuminuria
(D): Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine
(E): Bence-Jones proteinuria
",Selective albuminuria,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Selective albuminuria.

Explanation:
Selective albuminuria refers to the presence of albumin in the urine while other proteins are not present or are present in very low amounts. In this case, the patient has proteinuria exceeding 3.5g in 24 hours, indicating a significant loss of protein in the urine. The presence of pitting edema also suggests fluid retention, which can be caused by the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.

WBC casts in the urine (option A) suggest inflammation or infection in the urinary tract, but it does not confirm the diagnosis of loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.

RBC casts in the urine (option B) suggest glomerular damage or inflammation, but it does not confirm the diagnosis of loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.

Negatively birefringent crystals in the urine (option D) are typically seen in conditions such as gout or pseudogout, and they do not confirm the diagnosis of loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.

Bence-Jones proteinuria (option E) refers to the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chains in the urine and is typically seen in multiple myeloma. It is not specific to the loss of polyanions in the glomerular basement membranes.",
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent pain in her neck, right shoulder, and arm, as well as a tingling sensation in her right hand. She first noticed her symptoms after she got off a rollercoaster ride 2 months ago. Physical examination shows weakness when extending the right wrist against resistance. An MRI of the head and neck is shown. This patient's condition is most likely the result of nerve root compression by a structure derived from which of the following embryologic layers?
Options:
(A): Endoderm
(B): Neural crest
(C): Notochord
(D): Neural tube
(E): Surface ectoderm
",Notochord,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Notochord.

Explanation:
The symptoms described by the patient, including intermittent pain in the neck, right shoulder, and arm, as well as a tingling sensation in the right hand, are consistent with nerve root compression. Nerve root compression occurs when there is pressure on the nerves as they exit the spinal cord. In this case, the nerve root compression is likely caused by a structure derived from the notochord.

During embryonic development, the notochord is a structure that forms from the mesoderm and plays a crucial role in the development of the central nervous system. It serves as a scaffold for the formation of the neural tube, which eventually develops into the spinal cord. The notochord also gives rise to the intervertebral discs, which are located between the vertebrae in the spine.

In this patient's case, the nerve root compression is likely due to a herniated intervertebral disc. The herniated disc can compress the nerve roots as they exit the spinal cord, leading to the symptoms described. The notochord-derived intervertebral disc is the structure responsible for the nerve root compression in this scenario.",
"A 32-year-old female is brought to the emergency room by her friend for acute onset abdominal pain. She states that she was in a kickboxing class when she suddenly developed left-sided abdominal pain. Her past medical history is significant for chlamydia. She is currently sexually active and does not use contraception. Her menstrual periods occur regularly every 30 days. Her last menstrual period ended 2 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 14/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On physical exam, there is left-sided, lower abdominal tenderness and guarding. Pelvic examination is notable for clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa. A pelvic ultrasound with Doppler reveals a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Ectopic pregnancy
(B): Mittelschmerz
(C): Ovarian torsion
(D): Pelvic inflammatory disease
(E): Ruptured ovarian cyst
",Ruptured ovarian cyst,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Ruptured ovarian cyst.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a ruptured ovarian cyst. The patient's sudden onset of left-sided abdominal pain, along with tenderness and guarding on physical examination, suggests an acute abdominal condition. The presence of clear mucous in the vaginal introitus and tenderness of the left adnexa on pelvic examination further supports this diagnosis.

Ruptured ovarian cysts are a common cause of acute abdominal pain in women of reproductive age. They occur when a fluid-filled sac on the ovary bursts, releasing its contents into the abdominal cavity. This can cause irritation and inflammation, leading to pain and tenderness. The presence of a large amount of fluid in the rectouterine pouch on pelvic ultrasound with Doppler is consistent with a ruptured ovarian cyst.

Ectopic pregnancy (choice A) is a possibility in sexually active women, but the absence of vaginal bleeding, the recent normal menstrual period, and the absence of a positive pregnancy test make this diagnosis less likely.

Mittelschmerz (choice B) refers to the mid-cycle pain that some women experience during ovulation. However, the severity and sudden onset of the pain, along with the presence of tenderness and guarding, are not consistent with Mittelschmerz.

Ovarian torsion (choice C) is another possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with more severe and sudden-onset pain, along with nausea and vomiting. The absence of these symptoms makes ovarian torsion less likely.

Pelvic inflammatory disease (choice D) is characterized by lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and fever. While the patient has lower abdominal pain and clear mucous in the vaginal introitus, the absence of fever and the recent normal menstrual period make pelvic inflammatory disease less likely.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a ruptured ovarian cyst.",
"A 63-year-old man from the countryside presents with leg swelling and right upper abdominal tenderness. He reports a history of myocardial infarction 4 years ago, but he has no supporting documentation. At the moment, his only medication is aspirin. He also stated that he used to have ‘high blood sugars’ when checked in the hospital 4 years ago, but he did not follow up regarding this issue. He works as a farmer and noticed that it became much harder for him to work in the last few days because of fatigue and syncope. He has a 24-pack-year history of smoking and consumes alcohol occasionally. The vital signs include: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, respiratory rate 16/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, the patient is pale and acrocyanotic. There is a visible jugular vein distention and bilateral lower leg pitting edema. The pulmonary auscultation is significant for occasional bilateral wheezes. Cardiac auscultation is significant for a decreased S1, S3 gallop, and grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space. Abdominal percussion and palpation are suggestive of ascites. The hepatic margin is 3 cm below the right costal margin. Hepatojugular reflux is positive. Which of the following is the most likely clinical finding observed in this patient on an echocardiogram?
Options:
(A): Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41%
(B): Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation
(C): Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle
(D): Abnormal left ventricular relaxation
(E): Decreased right atrial pressure
",Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Increased peak tricuspid regurgitation.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, including symptoms of leg swelling, right upper abdominal tenderness, fatigue, and syncope, along with physical examination findings such as jugular vein distention, bilateral lower leg pitting edema, and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur best heard at the left sternal border in the 4th left intercostal space, the most likely clinical finding observed on an echocardiogram would be increased peak tricuspid regurgitation.

Tricuspid regurgitation occurs when the tricuspid valve, which separates the right atrium and right ventricle, does not close properly during systole, leading to backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium. This can result in symptoms such as fatigue and syncope, as well as signs of right-sided heart failure, including jugular vein distention, lower extremity edema, and ascites.

An echocardiogram is a non-invasive imaging test that uses ultrasound to visualize the heart and its structures. It can provide information about the structure and function of the heart, including the presence and severity of valvular regurgitation. In this case, an echocardiogram would likely show increased peak tricuspid regurgitation, confirming the clinical suspicion based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

The other options are less likely based on the given clinical information. Left ventricular ejection fraction of 41% (option A) would suggest reduced left ventricular function, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with right-sided heart failure. Hypokinetic wall of the left ventricle (option C) and abnormal left ventricular relaxation (option D) are also less likely given the predominance of right-sided symptoms and findings. Decreased right atrial pressure (option E) would not explain the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty discarding items in her home. She says that the accumulation of things in her kitchen and dining room makes regular use of these spaces incredibly difficult. Her behavior started when she was in high school. She feels anxious when she tries to discard her possessions and her husband tries to clean and organize the home. This behavior frustrates her because most of the items she saves have little emotional or monetary value. She reports that there has been no improvement despite attending cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for the past 6 months. She now feels that her behavior is “taking over” her life. She does not drink, smoke, or use illicit drugs. She takes no medications. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 116/80 mm Hg. On mental status examination, she is calm, alert, and oriented to person, place, and time. Her mood is depressed; her speech is organized, logical, and coherent; and there are no psychotic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Atomoxetine
(B): Fluoxetine
(C): Lamotrigine
(D): Buspirone
(E): Methylphenidate
",Fluoxetine,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Fluoxetine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, she is presenting with symptoms consistent with hoarding disorder. Hoarding disorder is characterized by persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, due to a perceived need to save them. This behavior leads to the accumulation of possessions that clutter and congest living areas, making them unusable for their intended purpose.

The first-line treatment for hoarding disorder is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine. SSRIs have been shown to be effective in reducing hoarding symptoms and improving overall functioning. Fluoxetine is a commonly used SSRI and has been specifically studied and approved for the treatment of hoarding disorder.

The patient's lack of improvement with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) suggests that pharmacotherapy may be necessary to augment her treatment. While CBT is an important component of treatment for hoarding disorder, medication can be added to address underlying neurobiological factors that contribute to the disorder.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to start her on fluoxetine, an SSRI.",
"A 59-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider complaining of diffuse bodily aches. She reports a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips that is worse in her right hip. She has a history of hypertension and recurrent renal stones for which she takes lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. She was admitted to the hospital earlier in the year after falling in her front yard and sustaining a distal radius fracture and vertebral compression fracture. Her temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 145/85 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 20/min. On exam, she is well-appearing with mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips. She has mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction. She has full range of motion in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Serum findings are notable for the following:

Serum:
Na+: 141 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 22 mEq/L
Urea nitrogen: 17 mg/dL
Glucose: 110 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.12 mg/dL
Ca2+: 11.2 mg/dL
Phosphate: 2.3 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.9 mg/dL
Alkaline phosphatase: 120 U/L

A radiograph of this patient’s right hip would most likely reveal which of the following?
Options:
(A): Expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins
(B): Irregular blastic lesion
(C): Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone
(D): Poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue
(E): Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis
",Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis of the hip. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as the hips and knees.

The patient's history of gradually worsening pain in her shoulders and hips, with the pain being worse in her right hip, is consistent with osteoarthritis. The presence of mild tenderness to palpation in her shoulders and hips, as well as mild pain with hip flexion and shoulder abduction, further supports this diagnosis.

The radiograph of the patient's right hip would most likely reveal a well-defined cystic lesion with peritrabecular fibrosis. This finding is characteristic of osteoarthritis and is caused by the formation of osteophytes (bone spurs) and the remodeling of bone in response to the degenerative changes in the joint.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. An expansile lytic lesion with thin sclerotic margins (option A) is more suggestive of a bone tumor, such as metastatic cancer. An irregular blastic lesion (option B) is more suggestive of Paget disease of the bone. Medullary bone destruction with elevated periosteum from cortical bone (option C) is more suggestive of an infection or inflammatory condition. A poorly marginated lesion extending into adjacent soft tissue (option D) is more suggestive of a soft tissue tumor or infection.",
"A 20-year-old woman is brought in for a psychiatric consultation by her mother who is concerned because of her daughter’s recent bizarre behavior. The patient’s father died from lung cancer 1 week ago. Though this has been stressful for the whole family, the daughter has been hearing voices and having intrusive thoughts ever since. These voices have conversations about her and how she should have been the one to die and they encourage her to kill herself. She has not been able to concentrate at work or at school. She has no other history of medical or psychiatric illness. She denies recent use of any medication. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, and temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F). On physical exam, she appears gaunt and anxious. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. CMP, CBC, and TSH are normal. A urine toxicology test is negative. What is the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Brief psychotic disorder
(B): Schizophreniform
(C): Adjustment disorder
(D): Schizophrenia
(E): Bereavement
",Brief psychotic disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Brief psychotic disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of hearing voices, having intrusive thoughts, and experiencing conversations about herself, along with the encouragement to kill herself, are indicative of psychotic symptoms. These symptoms have been present since the death of her father, which suggests a temporal relationship between the stressor and the onset of symptoms. The patient's symptoms are severe enough to impair her ability to function at work and school. Additionally, her physical exam findings of appearing gaunt and anxious are consistent with the distress she is experiencing. The absence of any other medical or psychiatric history, normal laboratory tests, and negative urine toxicology test support the diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder. This disorder is characterized by the presence of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions, that last for less than 1 month and are typically triggered by a significant stressor. In this case, the stressor is the recent death of the patient's father.",
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with difficulty breathing and a sensation that her heart was racing for the past 3 days. She adds that she has lost weight over the last 7 weeks, despite a good appetite, and is anxious most of the time with difficulty sleeping at night. She has smoked 10 cigarettes per day for the past 15 years. Her blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), and pulse is irregular with a rate of 140–150/min. On physical examination she is thin, frail, and appears anxious. Her palms are sweaty and there are fine tremors on extension of both hands. She has a palpable smooth thyroid mass. Examination of the eyes reveals bilateral exophthalmos. An electrocardiogram is obtained and shown in the picture. Which of the following has a strong positive correlation with this patient’s heart rhythm?
Options:
(A): Digoxin blood level
(B): PR interval
(C): QT interval
(D): Age
(E): Amiodarone blood level
",Age,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Age.

Explanation:
In this patient, the clinical presentation, including symptoms of difficulty breathing, palpitations, weight loss, anxiety, and tremors, along with physical examination findings of a thyroid mass and exophthalmos, are consistent with hyperthyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is a condition characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones, which can lead to a variety of cardiovascular manifestations, including tachycardia and arrhythmias.

The electrocardiogram (ECG) shown in the picture demonstrates an irregularly irregular rhythm, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is a common arrhythmia associated with hyperthyroidism. It is important to note that AF can occur in patients of any age, but the risk increases with age.

Age is a well-established risk factor for the development of AF. The prevalence of AF increases with advancing age, and older individuals are more likely to develop AF compared to younger individuals. This is due to age-related changes in the electrical conduction system of the heart, as well as the presence of other comorbidities that increase the risk of AF, such as hypertension and structural heart disease.

Therefore, in this patient, age has a strong positive correlation with the development of AF, which is the underlying cause of her irregular heart rhythm.",
"A 27-year-old male suddenly develops severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea. The patient reports consuming undercooked ground beef four days prior to the onset of the symptoms. Which of the following best describes the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process?
Options:
(A): Depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, leading to mucosal cell death
(B): Increased pH of gastrointestinal lumen resulting in reduced mucosal absorption
(C): Increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, resulting in decreased absorption and increased secretion in the digestive tract
(D): Inhibition of elongation factor-2 (EF-2), resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells
(E): Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells
","Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit, resulting in decreased protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal cramping and bloody diarrhea, along with a history of consuming undercooked ground beef, suggest a bacterial infection. One of the most common bacteria associated with this presentation is Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), specifically the strain known as E. coli O157:H7.

STEC produces Shiga toxins, which are responsible for the toxin-mediated mechanism of this disease process. These toxins inhibit the 60S ribosomal subunit, which is involved in protein synthesis in gastrointestinal mucosal cells. By inhibiting protein synthesis, the toxins cause death of the intestinal epithelium, leading to bloody diarrhea.

Option (A) is incorrect because depolymerization of actin filaments in gastrointestinal mucosal cells is not the mechanism of action for Shiga toxins.

Option (B) is incorrect because increased pH of the gastrointestinal lumen does not result in reduced mucosal absorption. In fact, changes in pH can affect the absorption of certain medications, but it is not the primary mechanism of action for Shiga toxins.

Option (C) is incorrect because increased intracellular cAMP in gastrointestinal mucosal cells is not the mechanism of action for Shiga toxins. Increased cAMP levels are associated with other bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin, which cause secretory diarrhea.

Option (D) is incorrect because inhibition of elongation factor-2 (EF-2) is not the mechanism of action for Shiga toxins. EF-2 is involved in protein synthesis, but it is not the target of these toxins.",
"A 46-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with one week of intermittent nausea and vomiting. She does not have any sick contacts, and her medical history is significant only for diabetes well-controlled on metformin. She also complains of some weakness and back/leg pain. She says that she recently returned from traveling abroad and had been administered an antibiotic during her travels for an unknown infection. On presentation, her temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 119/78 mmHg, pulse is 62/min, and respirations are 25/min. An EKG is obtained showing flattening of the T wave. After further testing, the physician prescribes a thiazide for this patient. Which of the following diseases is also associated with this patient's most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Rheumatoid arthritis
(B): Sickle cell disease
(C): Sjogren syndrome
(D): Systemic lupus erythematosus
(E): Wilson disease
",Wilson disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Wilson disease.

Explanation:
Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective hepatic copper transport, resulting in copper accumulation throughout the body. It typically presents in childhood or adolescence but can also present in adulthood. The symptoms can vary widely and may include hepatic, neurologic, and psychiatric manifestations.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of intermittent nausea and vomiting, weakness, and back/leg pain, along with the history of recent travel and antibiotic use, are suggestive of Wilson disease. The flattening of the T wave on EKG is a characteristic finding in Wilson disease due to the associated electrolyte abnormalities.

Thiazide diuretics are commonly used in the treatment of Wilson disease to promote urinary copper excretion and reduce copper accumulation in the body. Therefore, the prescription of a thiazide diuretic further supports the diagnosis of Wilson disease in this patient.

The other options (A) Rheumatoid arthritis, (B) Sickle cell disease, (C) Sjogren syndrome, and (D) Systemic lupus erythematosus are not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the patient's presentation.",
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle collision. He was the front seat unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. The patient has a Glasgow Coma Scale of 5 and is subsequently intubated. Physical exam is notable for subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area. Needle decompression and chest tube placement are performed, and the patient is stabilized after receiving 2 units of blood and 2 liters of fluid. Chest radiography demonstrates proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax. The patient is transferred to the trauma intensive care unit. On the unit, a repeat chest radiograph is notable for a recurrent pneumothorax with the chest tube in place. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Esophageal rupture
(B): Inappropriate chest tube placement
(C): Spontaneous pneumothorax
(D): Tension pneumothorax
(E): Tracheobronchial rupture
",Tracheobronchial rupture,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Tracheobronchial rupture.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient initially presented with subcutaneous emphysema in the clavicular area, which is a sign of air escaping from the respiratory system. The patient underwent needle decompression and chest tube placement, which resolved the initial pneumothorax. However, on a repeat chest radiograph, a recurrent pneumothorax is noted with the chest tube in place. This suggests that there is ongoing air leakage from the respiratory system, which is most likely due to a tracheobronchial rupture.

Esophageal rupture (option A) is less likely in this case because the patient did not present with symptoms such as severe chest pain, subcutaneous emphysema in the neck, or signs of mediastinitis.

Inappropriate chest tube placement (option B) is unlikely because the initial chest radiograph demonstrated proper tube location and resolution of the pneumothorax.

Spontaneous pneumothorax (option C) is less likely in this case because the patient's presentation is consistent with traumatic pneumothorax due to the motor vehicle collision.

Tension pneumothorax (option D) is less likely because the patient's condition has been stabilized after needle decompression and chest tube placement. A tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention, and the patient's symptoms would not have resolved with the initial treatment if tension pneumothorax was present.",
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 12 hours after the sudden onset of shortness of breath and substernal chest pain at rest; the pain is increased by inspiration. He has also had a nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise for the past 5 days. He does not smoke or use illicit drugs. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 125/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 85/45 mm Hg. Physical examination shows distended neck veins. Auscultation of the chest discloses bilateral basilar rales and muffled heart sounds. An ECG shows sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Kawasaki disease
(B): Rheumatic fever
(C): Dressler syndrome
(D): Infective endocarditis
(E): Cardiac tamponade
",Cardiac tamponade,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Cardiac tamponade.

Explanation:
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac, leading to compression of the heart and impaired cardiac function. The patient in this scenario presents with symptoms and signs consistent with cardiac tamponade.

The sudden onset of shortness of breath and substernal chest pain at rest, which is increased by inspiration, is a classic symptom of cardiac tamponade. The patient also has a nonproductive cough, fever, and malaise, which may be indicative of an underlying infection that could have led to the development of cardiac tamponade.

Physical examination findings of distended neck veins, bilateral basilar rales, and muffled heart sounds are consistent with cardiac tamponade. The distended neck veins are a result of increased venous pressure due to impaired filling of the heart. The basilar rales indicate fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can occur due to elevated pressures in the pulmonary circulation. The muffled heart sounds are a result of the fluid surrounding the heart, which dampens the transmission of sound.

The ECG findings of sinus tachycardia, diffuse ST segment elevation, low voltage QRS complexes, and fluctuating R wave amplitude are also consistent with cardiac tamponade. Sinus tachycardia is a compensatory response to decreased cardiac output. The diffuse ST segment elevation is a result of the impaired electrical conduction due to the fluid surrounding the heart. The low voltage QRS complexes and fluctuating R wave amplitude are due to the compression of the heart by the fluid.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade.",
"A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of frequent headaches and blurry vision during the past 4 months. He has also had difficulties achieving an erection over the past few weeks. Physical examination shows a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally. An MRI of the brain shows an intrasellar mass. The mass is most likely derived from which of the following types of cells?
Options:
(A): Thyrotrophs
(B): Lactotrophs
(C): Somatotrophs
(D): Gonadotrophs
(E): Corticotrophs
",Lactotrophs,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Lactotrophs.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of frequent headaches, blurry vision, and difficulties achieving an erection, along with the physical examination findings of a temporal visual field deficit bilaterally, the most likely diagnosis is a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas are benign tumors that arise from the cells of the pituitary gland.

The pituitary gland is composed of different types of cells, each responsible for producing and releasing specific hormones. Lactotrophs are the cells in the pituitary gland that produce and release prolactin, a hormone involved in milk production and regulation of reproductive function.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of headaches, visual disturbances, and erectile dysfunction are consistent with the effects of a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma, also known as a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary adenoma and can cause symptoms such as headaches, visual field deficits, and sexual dysfunction.

Therefore, the intrasellar mass seen on the MRI is most likely derived from lactotrophs, making option (B) Lactotrophs the correct answer.",
"A 33-year-old G2P1 woman presents to the office because of poor diabetic control. She is currently at 18 weeks gestation and admits to having poor control of her type 1 diabetes before becoming pregnant. Her family history is non-contributory. The physical examination shows a pregnant woman with a fundal height of 20 cm (7.9 in). An abdominal ultrasound is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound?
Options:
(A): Amelia
(B): Anencephaly
(C): Sacral agenesis
(D): Spina bifida
(E): Ventricular septal defect
",Ventricular septal defect,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Ventricular septal defect.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound is a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD is a common congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the septum (wall) between the two ventricles of the heart. 

The patient's poor diabetic control before becoming pregnant increases the risk of congenital abnormalities in the fetus. Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy can lead to various complications, including congenital heart defects. 

The fundal height of 20 cm at 18 weeks gestation is within the expected range, and it does not provide any specific information about the presence of a congenital abnormality. 

Amelia refers to the complete absence of one or more limbs, which is not related to the patient's history or the findings on the ultrasound. 

Anencephaly is a neural tube defect characterized by the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. While poorly controlled diabetes can increase the risk of neural tube defects, the physical examination findings and the ultrasound findings do not suggest anencephaly. 

Sacral agenesis is a rare congenital abnormality characterized by the incomplete development or absence of the sacrum, which is a bone at the base of the spine. Again, this condition is not suggested by the information provided. 

Spina bifida is another neural tube defect characterized by the incomplete closure of the spinal cord and its surrounding structures. While poorly controlled diabetes can increase the risk of spina bifida, the physical examination findings and the ultrasound findings do not suggest this condition. 

Therefore, the most likely congenital abnormality shown on the ultrasound in this scenario is a ventricular septal defect.",
"A 45-year-old G3P3 presents complaining of the feeling of a foreign body in her vagina that worsens on standing. She does not have urinary or fecal incontinence or any other genitourinary symptoms. She has no known gynecologic diseases. There were no complications with her pregnancies, all of which were full-term vaginal deliveries. She is sexually active with her husband and no longer uses oral contraceptives. She has an 11 pack-year history of smoking. Her weight is 79 kg (174 lb) and her height is 155 cm (5 ft). Her vital signs are within normal limits. The physical examination is unremarkable. The gynecologic examination reveals descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus. On Valsalva and standing, the cervix descents to the plane of the hymen. The uterus is not enlarged and the ovaries are non-palpable. Which of the following treatments is most reasonable to offer this patient?
Options:
(A): Support pessary
(B): Estrogen therapy
(C): Space-filling pessary
(D): Posterior colporrhaphy
(E): Sacral colpopexy
",Support pessary,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Support pessary.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, she likely has pelvic organ prolapse (POP), specifically a posterior vaginal defect (rectocele). The feeling of a foreign body in the vagina that worsens on standing is a common symptom of POP. The descent of the cervix halfway towards the introitus on examination further supports this diagnosis.

The initial management of POP, especially in patients who are symptomatic but do not have significant urinary or fecal incontinence, is conservative and non-surgical. The most reasonable treatment option in this case is a support pessary.

A support pessary is a device that is inserted into the vagina to provide support to the prolapsed organs and alleviate symptoms. It can be used to support the cervix and prevent it from descending further. The ring pessary, with or without support, is a commonly used supportive pessary. In one series, nearly all prolapse symptoms resolved with the use of a pessary, and there was no difference in success rates based on the location of the prolapse (anterior, apical, or posterior).

Estrogen therapy (option B) is not the most reasonable treatment option in this case because the patient does not have any genitourinary symptoms that would suggest estrogen deficiency. Estrogen therapy is typically used in postmenopausal women with genitourinary symptoms such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, or urinary symptoms.

Space-filling pessaries (option C) are commonly used for more advanced posterior prolapse (stage 3 or 4) and may not be necessary or effective in this patient with a less severe prolapse.

Posterior colporrhaphy (option D) and sacral colpopexy (option E) are surgical options for the treatment of POP. However, conservative management with a pessary is the most reasonable initial treatment option in this patient, especially since she does not have significant symptoms or complications from her prolapse.

Therefore, the most reasonable treatment to offer this patient is a support pessary (option A).",
"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 2, comes to the emergency department because of sudden-onset, severe right flank pain. She was in her aerobics class when the pain started but denies any trauma to the region. She has a history of recurrent ovarian cysts. Menses occur regularly at 28-day intervals. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99.3°F). Abdominal examination shows tenderness in the right lower quadrant with guarding. Pelvic ultrasound shows a large simple cyst on the right ovary. Right ovarian artery flow is detectable on Doppler, but there is no flow detected in the right ovarian vein. Which of the following ligaments is most likely to have been involved?
Options:
(A): Broad ligament
(B): Round ligament of the uterus
(C): Ovarian ligament
(D): Cardinal ligament
(E): Infundibulopelvic ligament
",Infundibulopelvic ligament,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Infundibulopelvic ligament.

Explanation:
The infundibulopelvic ligament, also known as the suspensory ligament of the ovary, is the most likely ligament to be involved in this case. The patient's symptoms, including sudden-onset severe right flank pain and tenderness in the right lower quadrant, along with the presence of a large simple cyst on the right ovary, suggest ovarian torsion.

Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists on its pedicle, compromising blood flow to the ovary. This can lead to severe pain and ischemia. In this case, the absence of flow in the right ovarian vein on Doppler ultrasound suggests compromised venous drainage due to torsion.

The infundibulopelvic ligament is responsible for suspending the ovary and contains the ovarian artery, ovarian vein, and nerves. When the ovary twists, the infundibulopelvic ligament becomes twisted, leading to torsion. This can result in compromised blood flow to the ovary, causing severe pain and potentially leading to ischemia and necrosis if not promptly treated.

The other ligaments listed in the options are not typically involved in ovarian torsion. The broad ligament is a peritoneal fold that supports the uterus and contains the fallopian tubes, round ligament of the uterus, and ovarian ligament. The round ligament of the uterus connects the uterus to the labia majora and is not directly involved in ovarian torsion. The ovarian ligament connects the ovary to the uterus and is not typically involved in torsion. The cardinal ligament provides support to the cervix and is not directly involved in ovarian torsion.",
"A 69-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Physical examination shows nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. The spleen is palpated 5 cm below the costal margin. Her leukocyte count is 12,000/mm3 and platelet count is 217,000/mm3. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Ringed sideroblasts
(B): Teardrop cells
(C): Smudge cells
(D): Reed-Sternberg cells
(E): Hypergammaglobulinemia
",Smudge cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Smudge cells.

Explanation:
The presence of nontender cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, along with palpable spleen, suggests the possibility of a hematologic malignancy, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL is a type of leukemia characterized by the proliferation of mature-appearing lymphocytes. Smudge cells, also known as basket cells or degenerative lymphocytes, are fragile lymphocytes that rupture during the preparation of blood smears, resulting in a characteristic appearance of smudged or fragmented cells. Smudge cells are commonly seen in CLL due to the fragile nature of the leukemic lymphocytes. 

Ringed sideroblasts (A) are seen in sideroblastic anemia, a disorder characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and the presence of iron-laden mitochondria in erythroblasts. This is not typically associated with the clinical presentation described in the question.

Teardrop cells (B) are seen in myelofibrosis, a disorder characterized by bone marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis. This is not typically associated with the clinical presentation described in the question.

Reed-Sternberg cells (D) are characteristic of Hodgkin lymphoma, a lymphoproliferative disorder. The clinical presentation and findings described in the question are not consistent with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Hypergammaglobulinemia (E) is a nonspecific finding that can be seen in various conditions, including chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, and multiple myeloma. It is not specific to the clinical presentation described in the question.",
"A 24-year-old married woman presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain since last night. She also complains of scant vaginal bleeding. She says she visited a physician last year who said she had a pelvic infection, but she was never treated because of insurance issues. She also says her period has been delayed this month. She is afebrile. The pulse is 124/min and the blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg. On examination, her abdomen is distended and tender. A pregnancy test was positive. A complication of infection with which of the following organisms most likely led to this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Candida albicans
(B): Neisseria gonorrhoeae
(C): Chlamydia trachomatis
(D): Mycoplasma genitalium
(E): Haemophilus influenzae
",Chlamydia trachomatis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Chlamydia trachomatis.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which is an infection of the upper genital tract. PID can lead to complications such as tubo-ovarian abscess, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. The most common organisms associated with PID are sexually transmitted infections, particularly Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

In this case, the patient's history of a previous pelvic infection and positive pregnancy test suggests that the infection has ascended to the upper genital tract, leading to PID. Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of PID, accounting for approximately 50% of cases. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is also a common cause, but it is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms have been present for a longer duration.

Candida albicans is a fungal infection and is not typically associated with PID. Mycoplasma genitalium is a less common cause of PID compared to Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Haemophilus influenzae is not a common cause of PID in sexually active individuals.

Therefore, the most likely organism leading to this patient's condition is Chlamydia trachomatis.",
"A 44-year-old man comes to the clinic because of a 6-month history of progressive fatigue. He has a history of intravenous heroin use. Physical examination shows scleral icterus. A serum study is positive for hepatitis C RNA. Therapy with interferon-α is initiated in combination with a second drug. The expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of which of the following enzymes?
Options:
(A): DNA integrase
(B): Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
(C): DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
(D): DNA gyrase
(E): Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase
",Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has a positive serum study for hepatitis C RNA, indicating an active hepatitis C infection. The therapy with interferon-α is initiated to treat the hepatitis C infection. Interferon-α is known to have antiviral effects by inhibiting viral replication.

The additional drug that is given in combination with interferon-α is most likely a nucleoside or nucleotide analog, which inhibits viral replication by interfering with the synthesis of viral nucleic acids. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is an enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides, which are essential for viral RNA synthesis. Inhibition of IMPDH prevents the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, leading to inhibition of viral RNA synthesis and replication.

Therefore, the expected beneficial effect of the additional drug is most likely due to inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH).",
"A 42-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He has not been to the doctor since he was 22 years of age. He reports that over the past three months, he has felt tired and weak despite no changes in diet or exercise. He is otherwise healthy and takes no medications. Family history is notable for colorectal cancer in his father and paternal uncle, ovarian cancer in his paternal grandmother, and pancreatic cancer in his paternal uncle. Physical examination is notable for conjunctival pallor. A complete blood count reveals a hemoglobin of 9.1 g/dL and hematocrit of 31%. A stool sample is hemoccult positive and a colonoscopy reveals a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon. Which of the following processes is most likely impaired in this patient?
Options:
(A): Homologous recombination
(B): Base excision repair
(C): Nucleotide excision repair
(D): Mismatch repair
(E): Non-homologous end joining
",Mismatch repair,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Mismatch repair.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with colorectal cancer, given his symptoms of fatigue, positive stool sample for blood, and the presence of a hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon on colonoscopy. The family history of colorectal cancer further supports this diagnosis. 

Mismatch repair is a DNA repair mechanism that corrects errors that occur during DNA replication. It is responsible for identifying and removing mismatched nucleotides that can lead to mutations. Mutations in genes involved in mismatch repair, such as MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, can lead to a condition called Lynch syndrome, which is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. 

In this patient, the impaired mismatch repair is likely contributing to the development of colorectal cancer. The presence of a fungating hemorrhagic mass in the ascending colon suggests an advanced stage of the disease. The patient's fatigue and anemia can be attributed to chronic blood loss from the tumor.",
"A 38-year-old woman presents to an urgent care clinic with the complaint of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain for the past 2 hours. She states that she has experienced similar pain in the past. These episodes occur mostly after meals and often subside several hours after she finishes eating. Due to this reason she mostly avoids eating. She says she has lost a few pounds in the last couple of months. She is a smoker and drinks alcohol occasionally. Past medical history is insignificant except for chronic knee pain, for which she takes over the counter painkillers. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 120/89 mm Hg. A physical abdominal exam is unremarkable, including examination of the abdomen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Duodenal peptic ulcer
(B): Choledocholithiasis
(C): Pancreatitis
(D): Gastric peptic ulcer
(E): Gallbladder cancer
",Gastric peptic ulcer,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Gastric peptic ulcer.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of epigastric discomfort and cramping pain that occurs mostly after meals and subsides several hours after eating is consistent with the symptoms of a gastric peptic ulcer. Gastric peptic ulcers are commonly associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as the over-the-counter painkillers the patient is taking for her chronic knee pain. The pain is typically described as a burning or gnawing sensation in the epigastric region. The fact that the patient avoids eating due to the pain and has lost weight in the past couple of months further supports the diagnosis of a gastric peptic ulcer. Other risk factors for gastric peptic ulcers include smoking and alcohol consumption, which the patient also has. The physical abdominal exam being unremarkable is consistent with a gastric peptic ulcer, as the pain is typically not associated with abdominal tenderness or other physical findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a gastric peptic ulcer.",
"A 19-year-old female college soccer player presents to a sports medicine clinic with right knee pain. One day prior she twisted her right knee and felt a “pop” while chasing after a ball. She has since felt severe throbbing knee pain and noticed a rapid increase in swelling around her knee. She is able to bear weight but feels “unstable” on her right leg. On exam, anterior drawer and Lachman’s tests are positive. The physician informs her that she has likely injured an important structure in her knee. What is the function of the structure that she has most likely injured?
Options:
(A): Prevent excess posterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur
(B): Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur
(C): Resist excess varus force on the knee
(D): Resist excess valgus force on the knee
(E): Provide a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles
",Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Prevent excess anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient most likely injured the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her knee. The ACL is responsible for preventing excess anterior translation of the tibia (shinbone) relative to the femur (thighbone). When the ACL is injured, there is increased anterior movement of the tibia, leading to instability and positive findings on the anterior drawer and Lachman's tests.

Option (A) is incorrect because the ACL prevents excess anterior translation, not posterior translation, of the tibia relative to the femur.

Option (C) is incorrect because the ACL is not involved in resisting varus force on the knee. Varus force refers to a force that pushes the knee inward, while valgus force refers to a force that pushes the knee outward.

Option (D) is incorrect because the ACL is not involved in resisting valgus force on the knee. Valgus force refers to a force that pushes the knee outward, while varus force refers to a force that pushes the knee inward.

Option (E) is incorrect because the function described does not match the function of the ACL. The ACL does not provide a cushion between the lateral tibial and femoral condyles.",
"Six hours after birth, a newborn boy is evaluated for tachypnea. He was delivered at 41 weeks' gestation via Caesarian section and the amniotic fluid was meconium-stained. His respiratory rate is 75/min. Physical examination shows increased work of breathing. X-rays of the abdomen and chest show no abnormalities. Echocardiography shows elevated pulmonary artery pressure. He is started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, and there is immediate improvement in his tachypnea and oxygenation status. Three hours later, the newborn is tachypneic and there is blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis?
Options:
(A): Increase in concentration of serum myoglobin
(B): Closure of the ductus arteriosus
(C): Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+
(D): Inhibition of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase
(E): Allosteric alteration of heme groups
",Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+

Explanation:
The most likely cause of this infant's cyanosis is the oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+. This is because the infant was started on an inhaled medication that increases smooth muscle cGMP, which suggests that the medication is a pulmonary vasodilator. The immediate improvement in tachypnea and oxygenation status indicates that the medication successfully reduced pulmonary artery pressure. However, three hours later, the infant becomes tachypneic again and develops blue-grey discoloration of the lips, fingers, and toes. This is consistent with methemoglobinemia, which occurs when there is an increase in the concentration of methemoglobin (Fe3+) in the blood. Methemoglobin cannot bind oxygen effectively, leading to tissue hypoxia and cyanosis. In this case, the inhaled medication likely caused the oxidization of Fe2+ to Fe3+, resulting in methemoglobinemia and subsequent cyanosis.",
"A study is conducted to determine the most effective ways to prevent transmission of various infective agents. One of the agents studied is a picornavirus that preferentially infects hepatocytes. The investigator determines that inactivating this virus can prevent its spread. Which of the following disinfectants is most likely to inactivate this virus?
Options:
(A): Benzalkonium chloride
(B): Chlorhexidine
(C): Sodium hypochlorite
(D): Sulfuric acid
(E): Ethyl alcohol
",Sodium hypochlorite,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Sodium hypochlorite.

Explanation:
According to the provided context information, it is stated that coronaviruses, which are a type of picornavirus, can be inactivated by 6% sodium hypochlorite solutions. Additionally, concentrations of 1:40 or higher of sodium hypochlorite have been shown to achieve satisfactory killing of coronaviruses. Therefore, sodium hypochlorite is the most likely disinfectant to effectively inactivate this picornavirus and prevent its spread. 

The other options, such as benzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, sulfuric acid, and ethyl alcohol, have not been shown to effectively kill coronaviruses unless combined with 70% ethanol.",
"A 34-year-old woman comes to the physician requesting prenatal care. For the past 2 months, she has had increasing breast tenderness, nausea, 3-kg (6.6-lb) weight gain, and urinary frequency. She is not sure about the date of her last menstrual period. She has been trying to conceive with her husband since she stopped taking oral contraceptives 6 months ago; she was happy to tell him last week that she is pregnant. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows mild, nontender abdominal enlargement. The cervical os is closed. Urine β-hCG is negative. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Delusion of pregnancy
(B): Pseudocyesis
(C): Pregnancy
(D): Incomplete abortion
(E): Ectopic pregnancy
",Pseudocyesis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Pseudocyesis.

Explanation:
Pseudocyesis, also known as false pregnancy or phantom pregnancy, is a condition in which a woman experiences the signs and symptoms of pregnancy, such as breast tenderness, weight gain, and abdominal enlargement, despite not being pregnant. This condition is believed to be caused by psychological factors, such as a strong desire to become pregnant or underlying emotional issues.

In this case, the patient has been trying to conceive with her husband for 6 months and was happy to tell him that she is pregnant. However, her urine β-hCG is negative and transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities. These findings suggest that she is not actually pregnant but is experiencing pseudocyesis.

The other options can be ruled out based on the information provided:
- Delusion of pregnancy (A): This refers to a psychiatric condition in which a woman strongly believes she is pregnant despite evidence to the contrary. However, the patient in this case does not exhibit any signs of psychiatric illness.
- Pregnancy (C): While the patient desires to be pregnant and is experiencing some symptoms commonly associated with pregnancy, the negative urine β-hCG and normal transvaginal ultrasonography indicate that she is not actually pregnant.
- Incomplete abortion (D): This refers to a pregnancy that has ended but some products of conception remain in the uterus. However, the patient's cervical os is closed, which is not consistent with an incomplete abortion.
- Ectopic pregnancy (E): This refers to a pregnancy that implants outside of the uterus, typically in the fallopian tube. However, the patient's transvaginal ultrasonography shows no abnormalities, making ectopic pregnancy unlikely.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is pseudocyesis.",
"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine physical examination. He lives in a group home and takes no medications. During the appointment, he frequently repeats the same information and needs to be reminded why he is at the doctor's office. He says that he is a famous poet and recently had a poem published in a national magazine. His vital signs are within normal limits. He has a constricted affect. Neurological examination shows no focal deficits. On mental status examination, he has no long-term memory deficits and is able to count in serial sevens without error. An MRI of the brain shows atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies. Which of the following is the most likely predisposing factor for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Consumption of undercooked meat
(B): Chronic hypertension
(C): Intravenous heroin use
(D): Alcohol use disorder
(E): Spirochete infection
",Alcohol use disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Alcohol use disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. This deficiency is commonly seen in individuals with alcohol use disorder due to poor nutrition and impaired thiamine absorption. The atrophy of the anterior thalami and small mamillary bodies seen on the MRI are characteristic findings in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. The patient's memory deficits, repetition of information, and confabulation (claiming to be a famous poet) are also consistent with this condition. Consumption of undercooked meat (A) is associated with infection by the spirochete bacteria that causes syphilis, which can lead to neurosyphilis and cognitive impairment. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with neurosyphilis. Chronic hypertension (B) can lead to vascular dementia, but the patient's MRI findings and clinical presentation are not consistent with this condition. Intravenous heroin use (C) is associated with an increased risk of infectious diseases, such as HIV and hepatitis, but it is not a common cause of the patient's presentation. Spirochete infection (E) is associated with neurosyphilis, which can cause cognitive impairment, but the patient's presentation is not consistent with this condition.",
"A medical student decides to join an immunology research center, which specifically works on capsular polysaccharide vaccine development against bacteria, such as Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. As a member of a research team working on the Hib vaccine, he asks his senior colleague why capsular polysaccharides are conjugated to protein carriers like tetanus toxoid during vaccine development. Which of the following is the best response to this question?
Options:
(A): Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgG2 dominant antibody responses
(B): Conjugation with a protein carrier generates IgM dominant antibody responses
(C): Polysaccharides conjugated with proteins are T cell-independent antigens
(D): Conjugation with a protein carrier improves vaccine stability
(E): Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants
",Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Conjugation with a protein carrier provides effective protection to infants.

Explanation:
Conjugation with a protein carrier is necessary during vaccine development to induce T cell-dependent memory, which increases immunogenicity in young children. Antibodies against the capsular polysaccharide activate complement, are opsonophagocytic and bactericidal, and protect from lethal Hib challenge in animal models. The protein carrier provides effective protection to infants by enhancing the immune response and generating a memory response, which is important for long-term immunity.",
"An investigator is studying the pattern of glutamate release from presynaptic nerve terminals in human volunteers with Alzheimer disease. The concentration of glutamate in the CA1 region of the hippocampus is measured using magnetic resonance spectroscopy after Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated. Which of the following events most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters?
Options:
(A): Activation of G protein-coupled receptors
(B): Synthesis of glutamine
(C): Accumulation of cAMP
(D): Opening of ligand-gated ion channels
(E): Influx of calcium
",Influx of calcium,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Influx of calcium.

Explanation:
The release of neurotransmitters, including glutamate, from presynaptic nerve terminals is triggered by the influx of calcium. When the Schaffer collateral fibers are electrically stimulated, voltage-gated calcium channels in the presynaptic terminal open, allowing calcium ions to enter the terminal. This influx of calcium is necessary for the fusion of synaptic vesicles containing glutamate with the presynaptic membrane and the subsequent release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft. Therefore, the influx of calcium is the event that most likely occurs immediately prior to the release of neurotransmitters.",
"A 24-year-old woman presents to a physician with a history of exposure to a close friend who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She was told by her friend that she need to see a physician because she needs to be treated as well, even if she is not having symptoms yet. She currently denies any headaches, vision changes, nausea or vomiting, or neck stiffness. Her physical exam is within normal limits. Her vital signs are stable. She is prescribed rifampin for prophylaxis with specific instructions on when to follow up if symptoms develop. When asked about the possibility of pregnancy, she mentioned that she uses combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for contraception. The physician suggested that her husband should use condoms for contraception as she requires antibiotic therapy. Which of the following mechanisms best explains the need for additional contraception?
Options:
(A): Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.
(B): Rifampin inhibits CYP3A4, which metabolizes progestins.
(C): Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of progestins.
(D): Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of estrogens.
(E): Rifampin directly interferes with intestinal absorption of progestins.
","Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.",Correct,"The correct choice is (A): Rifampin alters normal gastrointestinal flora, which leads to a decrease in the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens.

Explanation:
Rifampin is known to induce hepatic enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes, which can increase the metabolism of certain drugs. In the case of combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), rifampin can increase the metabolism of estrogen components, leading to a decrease in their effectiveness. This occurs because rifampin alters the normal gastrointestinal flora, which affects the enterohepatic circulation of estrogens. The enterohepatic circulation is the process by which drugs and other substances are absorbed in the intestines, transported to the liver, and then reabsorbed into the bloodstream. Rifampin disrupts this process, resulting in decreased levels of estrogens in the body and potentially reducing the effectiveness of OCPs. Therefore, additional contraception, such as condoms, is recommended to ensure adequate protection against pregnancy while taking rifampin.",
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of a painless, nonpruritic skin lesion on her right thigh. She initially thought it was an insect bite, but it has slowly increased in size over the past weeks. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 75/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a 0.8-cm hyperpigmented papule. When the skin lesion is squeezed, the surface retracts inwards. A photograph of the lesion is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Dysplastic nevus
(B): Dermatofibroma
(C): Cherry hemangioma
(D): Actinic keratosis
(E): Seborrheic keratosis
",Dermatofibroma,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Dermatofibroma.

Explanation:
Based on the description provided, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's skin lesion is a dermatofibroma. Dermatofibromas are benign skin growths that commonly occur on the extremities, such as the thighs. They often present as small, firm, hyperpigmented papules or nodules. The lesion may have a central dimple or depression, which is known as the ""dimple sign"" and can be observed when the lesion is squeezed. This is consistent with the finding described in the question stem, where the surface of the lesion retracts inwards when squeezed.

Dysplastic nevi, also known as atypical moles, are typically larger than the lesion described in the question stem and often have irregular borders and variable pigmentation. They are also associated with an increased risk of melanoma, but the presentation in this case does not suggest a dysplastic nevus.

Cherry hemangiomas are small, bright red papules that are typically found on the trunk and extremities. They do not have the characteristic dimple or depression seen in dermatofibromas.

Actinic keratosis is a precancerous skin lesion that is typically caused by sun exposure. It presents as rough, scaly patches on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, scalp, and hands. The description in the question stem does not match the presentation of actinic keratosis.

Seborrheic keratosis is a common benign skin growth that typically presents as a waxy, stuck-on lesion. It is often brown or black in color and can have a verrucous or ""stuck-on"" appearance. The description in the question stem does not match the presentation of seborrheic keratosis.",
"A previously healthy 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his parents because of fever and a rash for 6 days. His temperature is 38.9°C (102°F). Examination shows right-sided anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, bilateral conjunctival injection, erythema of the tongue and lips, and a maculopapular rash involving the hands, feet, perineum, and trunk. Which of the following is the most common complication of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Coronary artery aneurysm
(B): Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis
(C): Hearing loss
(D): Retinopathy
(E): Peripheral neuropathy
",Coronary artery aneurysm,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Coronary artery aneurysm.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by fever, rash, conjunctival injection, cervical lymphadenopathy, and mucous membrane changes. The most common complication of Kawasaki disease is coronary artery aneurysm. This occurs in approximately 15-25% of untreated cases and can lead to myocardial infarction or sudden death. Prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin can reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysm formation. 

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (choice B) is not a common complication of Kawasaki disease. It is more commonly associated with other conditions such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis.

Hearing loss (choice C) can occur in Kawasaki disease, but it is not the most common complication. It is estimated to occur in approximately 5-10% of cases.

Retinopathy (choice D) and peripheral neuropathy (choice E) are not commonly associated with Kawasaki disease.",
"A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police. He was found at a local celebration acting very strangely and was reported by other patrons of the event. The patient is very anxious and initially is hesitant to answer questions. He denies any substance use and states that he was just trying to have a good time. The patient's responses are slightly delayed and he seems to have difficulty processing his thoughts. The patient tells you he feels very anxious and asks for some medication to calm him down. The patient has a past medical history of psoriasis which is treated with topical steroids. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. On physical exam, you note an anxious young man. HEENT exam reveals a dry mouth and conjunctival injection. Neurological exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in his upper and lower extremities. Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia, and pulmonary exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely intoxication in this patient?
Options:
(A): Alcohol
(B): Benzodiazepines
(C): Marijuana
(D): Cocaine
(E): Phencyclidine
",Marijuana,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Marijuana.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely intoxication in this patient is marijuana. The patient's symptoms of anxiety, delayed responses, difficulty processing thoughts, dry mouth, and conjunctival injection are consistent with the effects of marijuana use. Marijuana can cause anxiety and impair cognitive function, leading to delayed responses and difficulty processing thoughts. Dry mouth and conjunctival injection are common physical findings associated with marijuana use. The patient's vital signs, including tachycardia, are also consistent with marijuana intoxication. It is important to note that the patient denies substance use, which is a common characteristic of individuals under the influence of marijuana. Additionally, the patient's past medical history of psoriasis and treatment with topical steroids is not relevant to the current presentation and does not suggest an alternative diagnosis.",
"A 75-year-old with hypertension and atrial fibrillation comes to the emergency department because of a 2-hour history of severe abdominal pain and nausea. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the past 45 years. The patient undergoes emergency laparotomy and is found to have dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and an adjacent segment of the transverse colon. The most likely cause of his condition is occlusion of a branch of which of the following arteries?
Options:
(A): Median sacral artery
(B): Inferior mesenteric artery
(C): Celiac artery
(D): Internal iliac artery
(E): Superior mesenteric artery
",Superior mesenteric artery,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Superior mesenteric artery.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain and nausea, along with the finding of dusky discoloration of the hepatic colonic flexure and adjacent segment of the transverse colon, suggests ischemic colitis. Ischemic colitis is most commonly caused by occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) or one of its branches. Risk factors for SMA occlusion include advanced age, hypertension, smoking, and atrial fibrillation, all of which are present in this patient. The SMA supplies blood to the midgut, including the transverse colon, and occlusion of its branches can lead to ischemia and infarction of the affected bowel segment. The other options listed (A, B, C, and D) are not associated with the specific presentation and risk factors described in this patient.",
"A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following?
Options:
(A): The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population
(B): The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group
(C): The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population
(D): The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths
(E): The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year
",The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths.

Explanation:
In this study, the researchers calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) to measure mortality rates in psychiatric patients. SMRs are calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths by the expected number of deaths. The observed number of deaths refers to the actual number of deaths that occurred in the study population, while the expected number of deaths is the number of deaths that would be expected based on the mortality rates in the general population. By comparing the observed and expected number of deaths, SMRs provide a measure of the relative risk of mortality in the study population compared to the general population. In this case, the overall SMR was 1.63, indicating that the mortality rate in the psychiatric patients was 1.63 times higher than expected. The higher SMRs in men, younger age groups, and patients with alcohol and drug dependence suggest that these subgroups had even higher mortality rates compared to the general population.",
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his grandparents. He is in a wheelchair with soft restraints because he has been violent and had been trying to hurt himself that day. The child’s parents died in a car accident 1 month ago. His grandparents also brought the medications he stopped taking after his parents’ death, including multivitamins, allopurinol, and diazepam. They say that their grandson has been using these medications for many years; however, they are unable to provide any medical history and claim that their grandson has been behaving strangely, exhibiting facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements for the past few days. They also note that he has had no teeth since the time they first met him at the age of 2. An intramuscular medication is administered to calm the boy down prior to drawing blood from him for laboratory tests. Which of the following biochemical pathway abnormalities is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway
(B): Aminolevulinic acid synthetase of the heme metabolism pathway
(C): Adenosine deaminase of the purine metabolism pathway
(D): Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway
(E): Thymidylate synthetase of the pyrimidine metabolism pathway
",Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase of the purine metabolism pathway.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HGPRT), an enzyme involved in the purine metabolism pathway. The symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome include self-mutilation, aggression, and neurologic abnormalities such as facial grimacing, irregular involuntary contractions, and writhing movements. The absence of teeth since the age of 2 is also a characteristic finding in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The patient's behavior and symptoms are likely exacerbated by the recent loss of his parents, which may have contributed to his increased agitation and self-harming behavior. The administration of an intramuscular medication to calm the patient down prior to laboratory tests suggests that the healthcare team is trying to manage his symptoms and obtain necessary blood samples.",
"A 34-year-old woman with poorly controlled Crohn disease comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of hair loss and a rash on her face. She has also noticed that food has recently tasted bland to her. She had to undergo segmental small bowel resection several times because of intestinal obstruction and fistula formation. Examination shows several bullous, erythematous perioral plaques. There are two well-circumscribed circular patches of hair loss on the scalp. A deficiency of which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Retinoic acid
(B): Niacin
(C): Cobalamin
(D): Iron
(E): Zinc
",Zinc,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Zinc.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with zinc deficiency. Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including immune function, wound healing, and DNA synthesis. In patients with Crohn disease, malabsorption due to intestinal resection and inflammation can lead to zinc deficiency.

The patient's symptoms of hair loss, rash on the face, and bland taste in food are all characteristic of zinc deficiency. Hair loss is a common manifestation of zinc deficiency and typically presents as well-circumscribed circular patches of hair loss on the scalp. The rash on the face, known as perioral plaques, is also a common finding in zinc deficiency. Additionally, zinc is important for taste perception, and a deficiency can lead to a decreased ability to taste food.

Retinoic acid (A) deficiency can cause skin changes, but it is not associated with hair loss or taste changes. Niacin (B) deficiency can cause a rash, but it does not typically present with hair loss or taste changes. Cobalamin (C) deficiency can cause hair loss, but it is not associated with the specific rash described in the patient. Iron (D) deficiency can cause hair loss, but it is not associated with the rash or taste changes seen in this patient.",
"A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 20 weeks of gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal exam. Her last pregnancy was unremarkable and she gave birth to a healthy rhesus (RhD) positive girl. Her past medical history is notable for a blood transfusion after a car accident with a complex femur fracture about 3 years ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 92/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. Examination shows that the uterus is at the umbilicus. Ultrasound examination reveals normal fetal heart rate, movement, and anatomy. Routine prenatal labs show the following:
Blood type A Rh-
Leukocyte count 11,000/mm3
Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL
Platelet count 345,000/mm3
Serum
Anti-D antibody screen Negative
Rubella IgM Negative
Rubella IgG Negative
Varicella IgM Negative
Varicella IgG Positive
STD panel Negative
Urine
Protein Trace
Culture No growth
Cervical cytology Normal
Which of the following is the best next step in management of this patient?""
Options:
(A): Administer anti-D immunoglobulin now and repeat antibody screening shortly before delivery.
(B): Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.
(C): Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks and administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks. No further management is needed.
(D): No further screening is needed. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin shortly after delivery
(E): No further management is needed
""
",Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks. Administer anti-D immunoglobulin at 28 weeks and after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient is Rh(D) negative and has a history of a previous pregnancy with a Rh(D) positive baby. This puts her at risk for developing Rh(D) alloimmunization, which can lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn in subsequent pregnancies. The best next step in management is to repeat antibody screening at 28 weeks of gestation. This is because the initial antibody screen was negative, but it is important to monitor for the development of anti-D antibodies throughout the pregnancy. If the antibody screen remains negative at 28 weeks, anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered to prevent sensitization. Anti-D immunoglobulin should also be administered after delivery if the newborn is Rh(D) positive to prevent the development of antibodies in future pregnancies. Therefore, option (B) is the correct choice.",
"A 52-year-old man presents to the physician because of ongoing shortness of breath, which is more prominent when he lies down. Occasionally, he experiences palpitations, especially during strenuous activities. In addition to this, he has been experiencing difficulty in digestion and often experiences regurgitation and dysphagia. He reports that he emigrated from Mexico 20 years ago and visits his hometown twice a year. The vital signs include: blood pressure 120/75 mm Hg, respiratory rate 19/min, and pulse 100/min. The physical examination shows jugular vein distention along with pitting edema in the ankles. Bilateral basilar crackles and an S3 gallop are heard on auscultation of the chest. A chest X-ray is taken. An electrocardiogram (ECG) shows no significant findings. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s physical and diagnostic findings?
Options:
(A): Alcohol abuse
(B): Hypertensive changes
(C): Parasitic infection
(D): Myocardial infarction
(E): Bacterial infection
",Parasitic infection,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Parasitic infection.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical findings are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The shortness of breath that worsens when lying down, jugular vein distention, pitting edema in the ankles, and bilateral basilar crackles on auscultation are all indicative of fluid overload in the body, which is a characteristic feature of CHF. The S3 gallop is also a common finding in CHF.

The patient's history of emigrating from Mexico and visiting his hometown twice a year is important because it raises suspicion for Chagas disease, which is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Chagas disease is endemic in Mexico and other parts of Central and South America. The parasite can cause chronic inflammation and damage to the heart muscle, leading to the development of CHF.

The absence of significant findings on the electrocardiogram (ECG) does not rule out a parasitic infection as the cause of the patient's symptoms. In Chagas disease, ECG abnormalities may not be present in the early stages of the disease.

Alcohol abuse (option A) can cause cardiomyopathy and lead to heart failure, but the patient's history and physical findings are more suggestive of a parasitic infection.

Hypertensive changes (option B) can lead to heart failure, but the patient's blood pressure is within the normal range and there are no other findings to suggest hypertensive heart disease as the cause of his symptoms.

Myocardial infarction (option D) typically presents with chest pain and ECG changes indicative of ischemia or infarction. The patient's symptoms and physical findings are not consistent with a myocardial infarction.

Bacterial infection (option E) can cause sepsis and lead to heart failure, but there are no signs or symptoms to suggest an acute bacterial infection in this patient. Additionally, the absence of fever and the chronic nature of the symptoms make a bacterial infection less likely.",
"A 33-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician with bilateral joint pain. She says that the pain has been slowly worsening over the past 3 days. Otherwise, she complains of fatigue, a subjective fever, and a sunburn on her face which she attributes to gardening. The patient is an immigrant from Spain and works as an office assistant. She is not aware of any chronic medical conditions and takes a multivitamin daily. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 125/64 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Decreased anti-dsDNA antibodies
(B): Decreased complement levels
(C): Increased anti-centromere antibodies
(D): Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies
(E): Increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies
",Decreased complement levels,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Decreased complement levels.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of bilateral joint pain, fatigue, subjective fever, and a sunburn-like rash on her face, along with the physical exam finding of bilateral redness over the maxillary prominences, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). 

In SLE, the immune system produces autoantibodies that target self-antigens, leading to inflammation and tissue damage. One of the characteristic features of SLE is the presence of immune complexes, which are formed when autoantibodies bind to self-antigens. These immune complexes can activate the complement system, leading to complement consumption and decreased complement levels.

Therefore, in this patient with suspected SLE, the most likely finding would be decreased complement levels (Choice B). The other options are not typically associated with SLE. Decreased anti-dsDNA antibodies (Choice A) and increased anti-topoisomerase antibodies (Choice E) are seen in systemic sclerosis. Increased anti-centromere antibodies (Choice C) are seen in limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Increased anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (Choice D) are seen in rheumatoid arthritis.",
"A 40-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 4-day history of left leg pain. Over the weekend, he scraped his left thigh when he fell on a muddy field while playing flag football with some friends. Since that time, he has had progressively worsening redness and pain in his left thigh. Past medical history is unremarkable. His temperature is 39.4°C (103.0°F), heart rate is 120/min, and blood pressure is 95/60 mm Hg. Physical exam is significant for a poorly-demarcated area of redness on his left thigh, extending to about a 10 cm radius from a small scrape. This area is extremely tender to palpation, and palpation elicits an unusual 'crunchy' sensation. CT scan shows free air in the soft tissue of the left leg. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Bacterial endocarditis
(B): Bacterial pneumonia
(C): Bacterial sinusitis
(D): Food-borne illness
(E): Urinary tract infection
",Food-borne illness,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Food-borne illness.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is necrotizing fasciitis, which is a severe soft tissue infection. The presence of free air in the soft tissue on CT scan is highly suggestive of gas-producing bacteria, which are commonly associated with necrotizing fasciitis. 

Necrotizing fasciitis is often caused by bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract, which can enter the body through a break in the skin, such as the scrape on the patient's thigh. These bacteria can be ingested through contaminated food, leading to a food-borne illness. Therefore, the organism responsible for this patient's presentation is also a common cause of food-borne illness.

Bacterial endocarditis (A), bacterial meningitis (B), bacterial pneumonia (C), and urinary tract infection (E) are not typically associated with the clinical presentation described in the question. Bacterial sinusitis (C) is also unlikely as the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are localized to the left thigh and not suggestive of sinus involvement.",
"A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a racing heart and lightheadedness for 3 hours. He has had similar episodes in the past, but the symptoms never lasted this long. He denies chest pain, shortness of breath, headaches, and fevers. He had a myocardial infarction 4 years ago and currently takes captopril, metoprolol, and atorvastatin. His pulse is irregular and cardiac auscultation reveals an irregular heart rhythm. Laboratory reports show:
Serum glucose 88 mg/dL

An ECG shows the absence of P-waves with an irregular RR complex. A few hours later, his symptoms subside and he is discharged with an additional anticoagulation drug. Which of the following mechanisms explains how this new medication will exert its effects?
Options:
(A): Activation of the antithrombin enzyme
(B): Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase enzyme
(C): Inhibition of the ADP receptors
(D): Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors
(E): Blockage of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors
",Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, irregular heart rhythm, and absence of P-waves on ECG are consistent with atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is a common arrhythmia characterized by rapid and irregular atrial electrical activity, resulting in an irregular ventricular response. It is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke, due to the formation of blood clots in the atria.

Anticoagulation therapy is essential in patients with AF to prevent the formation of blood clots. The most commonly used anticoagulant for this purpose is warfarin, which acts by inhibiting the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors (factors II, VII, IX, and X) in the liver. These clotting factors are necessary for the formation of a stable blood clot.

By inhibiting the synthesis of these clotting factors, warfarin reduces the ability of the blood to clot, thereby preventing the formation of blood clots in the atria. This reduces the risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke, in patients with AF.

Therefore, the mechanism by which the new medication will exert its effects in this patient is the inhibition of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors.",
"A 31-year-old man, who was hospitalized for substance-induced psychosis two days prior, has had episodic neck stiffness and pain for the past 8 hours. These episodes last for approximately 25 minutes and are accompanied by his neck rotating to the right. During the last episode, he was able to relieve the stiffness by lightly touching his jaw. He has received six doses of haloperidol for auditory hallucinations since his admission. He appears anxious. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 108/min, and blood pressure is 128/86 mm Hg. Examination shows a flexed neck rotated to the right. The neck is rigid with limited range of motion. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Benztropine
(B): Physical therapy
(C): Dantrolene
(D): Baclofen
(E): Propranolol
",Benztropine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Benztropine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including episodic neck stiffness and pain with rotation to the right, along with relief of symptoms by touching his jaw, are consistent with acute dystonia. Acute dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions, often involving the neck muscles. It can be a side effect of antipsychotic medications such as haloperidol. 

The most appropriate therapy for acute dystonia is an anticholinergic medication, such as benztropine. Benztropine blocks the action of acetylcholine in the central nervous system, helping to relieve muscle spasms and stiffness. It is commonly used to treat drug-induced dystonia. 

Physical therapy, dantrolene, baclofen, and propranolol are not the first-line treatments for acute dystonia. Physical therapy may be helpful for long-term management of dystonia, but it is not the initial treatment for acute symptoms. Dantrolene is a muscle relaxant that is used primarily for the treatment of malignant hyperthermia and spasticity, not acute dystonia. Baclofen is also a muscle relaxant, but it is primarily used for the treatment of spasticity associated with conditions such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury. Propranolol is a beta-blocker that is used primarily for the treatment of hypertension and cardiac conditions, and it is not indicated for the treatment of acute dystonia.",
"A 31-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with fevers, chills, and night sweats. After a physical exam and a series of laboratory tests, the patient undergoes a lymph node biopsy (Image A). Three days later, while awaiting treatment, he presents to his physician complaining of generalized swelling and is found to have 4+ protein in his urine. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be found on renal biopsy in this patient?
Options:
(A): Rapidly progresive glomerulonephritis
(B): Amyloidosis
(C): Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
(D): Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(E): Minimal change disease
",Minimal change disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Minimal change disease.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of generalized swelling and significant proteinuria (4+) is suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the presence of proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. 

Among the options provided, minimal change disease is the most likely pathological finding on renal biopsy in this patient. Minimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and accounts for a significant proportion of cases in adults as well. It is characterized by normal appearing glomeruli on light microscopy, hence the name ""minimal change."" However, electron microscopy reveals effacement of the foot processes of podocytes, which is the underlying pathologic finding in this disease.

Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (A) is characterized by a rapid decline in renal function over days to weeks, often leading to end-stage renal disease. It is typically associated with crescent formation on renal biopsy.

Amyloidosis (B) is a condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in various organs, including the kidneys. Renal biopsy in amyloidosis typically shows the presence of amyloid deposits within the glomeruli and blood vessels.

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (C) is a type of glomerulonephritis characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and proliferation of mesangial cells. It is associated with immune complex deposition and can present with nephrotic or nephritic syndrome.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (D) is a pattern of glomerular injury characterized by sclerosis involving only a portion (segment) of the glomerulus. It is a common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults and can be primary or secondary to other conditions.",
"A microbiologist has isolated several colonies of Escherichia coli on an agar plate. The microbiologist exposes the agar plate to ciprofloxacin, which destroys all of the bacteria except for one surviving colony. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony?
Options:
(A): Replacement of D-alanine
(B): Mutation of DNA gyrase
(C): Inactivation by bacterial transferase
(D): Production of β-lactamase
(E): Modification of surface binding proteins
",Mutation of DNA gyrase,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): Mutation of DNA gyrase.

Explanation:
Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that targets DNA gyrase, an enzyme involved in DNA replication and repair. The most likely mechanism of antibiotic resistance in the surviving colony is a mutation in the DNA gyrase gene. This mutation alters the structure or function of DNA gyrase, making it less susceptible to the inhibitory effects of ciprofloxacin. As a result, the bacteria are able to survive exposure to the antibiotic. This mechanism of resistance is commonly observed in fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of Escherichia coli.",
"A 48-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his son with a fever over the past day. The patient’s son adds that his father has been having some behavioral problems, as well, and that he was complaining about bugs crawling over his skin this morning even though there were no insects. Past medical history is unremarkable. No current medications. The patient was an alcoholic for several years but abruptly quit drinking 5 days ago. The patient’s temperature is 40.0°C (104.0°F), pulse is 130/min, blood pressure is 146/88 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, he is confused, restless, agitated, and lacks orientation to time, place or person. Which of the following the most appropriate initial course of treatment of this patient?
Options:
(A): Chlorpromazine
(B): Clonidine
(C): Diazepam
(D): Haloperidol
(E): Phenytoin
",Diazepam,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Diazepam.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with alcohol withdrawal delirium, also known as delirium tremens (DTs). DTs typically occur 2-4 days after the cessation of alcohol intake and are characterized by severe autonomic hyperactivity, altered mental status, and perceptual disturbances. The symptoms can include fever, tachycardia, hypertension, tremors, diaphoresis, hallucinations, and delusions.

The initial treatment of choice for alcohol withdrawal delirium is benzodiazepines, such as diazepam. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing the severity of withdrawal symptoms and preventing progression to more severe complications, such as seizures and cardiovascular instability. Diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that can be given orally or intravenously. It has a rapid onset of action and provides sedation, anxiolysis, and anticonvulsant effects.

Chlorpromazine (A) is an antipsychotic medication that is not typically used as the initial treatment for alcohol withdrawal delirium. It may be used in combination with benzodiazepines if the patient is experiencing severe agitation or hallucinations.

Clonidine (B) is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist that is primarily used for the treatment of hypertension. While it may help with some of the autonomic symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, it is not the initial treatment of choice for alcohol withdrawal delirium.

Haloperidol (D) is an antipsychotic medication that may be used in combination with benzodiazepines for the treatment of severe agitation or hallucinations in alcohol withdrawal delirium. However, it is not the initial treatment of choice.

Phenytoin (E) is an antiepileptic medication that is not typically used as the initial treatment for alcohol withdrawal delirium. It may be considered if the patient is experiencing seizures, but benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment for both the prevention and treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures.",
"Eight weeks after starting a new weight-loss medication, a 43-year-old woman with obesity comes to the physician because of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence. She also complains of progressively worsening night-time vision. She has had no fever, chills, or vomiting. Physical examination shows dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of the drug she is taking?
Options:
(A): Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release
(B): Inhibition of serotonin reuptake
(C): Stimulation of norepinephrine release
(D): Inhibition of lipase
(E): Secretion of glucose-dependent insulin
",Inhibition of lipase,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Inhibition of lipase.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of greasy diarrhea, excessive belching, and flatulence are suggestive of malabsorption of fat. This is likely due to the inhibition of lipase, which is an enzyme responsible for breaking down dietary fats into absorbable forms. By inhibiting lipase, the weight-loss medication prevents the absorption of dietary fats, leading to the symptoms of fat malabsorption.

The patient's progressively worsening night-time vision and dry, scaly skin on her extremities and face are consistent with vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that requires the presence of dietary fats for absorption. Inhibition of lipase would impair the absorption of vitamin A, leading to its deficiency and the associated symptoms.

Stimulation of monoamine neurotransmitter release (option A) and stimulation of norepinephrine release (option C) are mechanisms of action commonly seen in medications used for the treatment of depression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), respectively. These mechanisms are not relevant to the symptoms described in the patient.

Inhibition of serotonin reuptake (option B) is a mechanism of action seen in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are commonly used as antidepressants. This mechanism is not relevant to the symptoms described in the patient.

Secretion of glucose-dependent insulin (option E) is a mechanism of action seen in medications used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This mechanism is not relevant to the symptoms described in the patient.",
"A 70-year-old man with chronic heart failure presents to the emergency department due to difficulty in breathing. The patient is a known hypertensive for 20 years maintained on amlodipine and telmisartan. The physician notes that he is also being given a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. Which drug is being referred to in this case?
Options:
(A): Furosemide
(B): Hydrochlorothiazide
(C): Triamterene
(D): Acetazolamide
(E): Eplerenone
",Triamterene,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Triamterene.

Explanation:
Triamterene is a diuretic that blocks the Na+ channels in the cortical collecting tubule. It is commonly used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. By blocking the Na+ channels, triamterene inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and water, leading to increased urine output and decreased fluid volume in the body. This helps to reduce blood pressure and relieve symptoms of fluid overload, such as difficulty in breathing. Triamterene is often used in combination with other diuretics, such as thiazides or loop diuretics, to enhance its diuretic effect. In this case, the patient is already on amlodipine and telmisartan, which are commonly used antihypertensive medications. Triamterene is likely added to the patient's regimen to further control blood pressure and manage fluid overload associated with heart failure.",
"A 59-year-old man with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department for evaluation of his fever and night sweats. He is extremely lethargic and is unable to provide an adequate history to his physician. His wife noted that roughly 3 days ago, her husband mentioned that something bit him, but she cannot remember what exactly. The vital signs include blood pressure 85/67 mm Hg, pulse rate 107/min, and respiratory rate 35/min. Upon examination, the man is currently afebrile but is lethargic and pale. His spleen is surgically absent. There are some swollen bite marks on his right hand with red streaks extending to his elbow. Which of the following bites would be most concerning in this patient?
Options:
(A): Cat bite
(B): Human bite
(C): Spider bite
(D): Fish bite
(E): Dog bite
",Dog bite,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Dog bite.

Explanation:
In this patient with sickle cell disease, the most concerning bite would be a dog bite. Dog bites can lead to serious infections, including cellulitis and osteomyelitis, which can be particularly dangerous in individuals with compromised immune systems, such as those with sickle cell disease. The presence of swollen bite marks on the right hand with red streaks extending to the elbow suggests an ascending infection, which is a serious complication. Additionally, the patient's lethargy, pale appearance, and vital signs (low blood pressure, elevated heart rate, and increased respiratory rate) indicate that he is in a state of sepsis, which can be life-threatening. Prompt medical attention and treatment with antibiotics are necessary in this case.",
"A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of increasing weakness in both legs for 7 days. She also reports a tingling sensation in her legs that is exacerbated by taking a hot shower. She is sexually active with one male partner and does not use condoms. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.1°F). Physical examination shows decreased muscle strength and clonus in both lower extremities. Patellar reflex is 4+ bilaterally and plantar reflex shows an extensor response on both sides. Abdominal reflex is absent. An MRI of the brain is shown. Which of the following findings is most likely to further support the diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum
(B): Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy
(C): Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation
(D): Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture
(E): Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum
""
",Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid immunofixation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sensory abnormalities. GBS is often preceded by an infection, and in this case, the patient's sexual activity without condom use may have put her at risk for a sexually transmitted infection that could have triggered the autoimmune response.

The presence of immunoglobulin bands on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) immunofixation is a characteristic finding in GBS. CSF analysis is an important diagnostic tool in GBS, as it can show elevated protein levels and the presence of albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein without an increase in white blood cells). The immunofixation test can further confirm the presence of immunoglobulin bands, which are indicative of an immune response in the central nervous system.

The other options are not consistent with the diagnosis of GBS:
(A) Positive antibody response to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen in the serum is suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome, which is not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the patient.
(B) Oligodendrocytes that stain positive for polyomavirus proteins on brain biopsy would be more consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, which typically presents with focal neurological deficits and is not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the patient.
(D) Identification of gram-positive cocci in groups on blood culture would suggest a bacterial infection, such as streptococcal or staphylococcal infection, which is not consistent with the autoimmune nature of GBS.
(E) Detection of high-affinity antibodies to dsDNA in the serum is suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not associated with the symptoms and findings described in the patient.",
"A group of investigators is studying the association between a fire retardant chemical used on furniture and interstitial lung disease. They use hospital records to identify 50 people who have been diagnosed with interstitial lung disease. They also identify a group of 50 people without interstitial lung disease who are matched in age and geographic location to those with the disease. The participants' exposure to the chemical is assessed by surveys and home visits. Which of the following best describes this study design?
Options:
(A): Case-control study
(B): Cross-sectional study
(C): Case series
(D): Retrospective cohort study
(E): Randomized controlled trial
",Case-control study,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Case-control study.

Explanation:
In this study design, the investigators are comparing a group of individuals with interstitial lung disease (cases) to a group without the disease (controls). This is done by using hospital records to identify the cases and then selecting a group of controls who are matched in age and geographic location to the cases. The exposure to the fire retardant chemical used on furniture is assessed in both groups through surveys and home visits.

A case-control study is a retrospective study design, meaning that it starts after the onset of the disease. The cases are identified first, and then the exposure history is assessed. This study design is useful for investigating the association between an exposure and a disease outcome.

A cross-sectional study involves collecting data on both exposure and disease status at the same time, without following the participants over time. This study design is not applicable in this scenario as the investigators are interested in the association between exposure to the fire retardant chemical and the development of interstitial lung disease.

A case series involves describing and analyzing a group of patients with a particular disease or condition. It does not involve a comparison group and does not assess exposure.

A retrospective cohort study involves identifying a group of individuals with a particular exposure and a group without the exposure, and then following them over time to determine the development of the disease outcome. This study design is not applicable in this scenario as the investigators are not following the participants over time.

A randomized controlled trial involves randomly assigning participants to different groups, with one group receiving the exposure of interest and the other group serving as a control. This study design is not applicable in this scenario as the exposure to the fire retardant chemical is not being manipulated by the investigators.",
"A 41-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after a suicide attempt. His wife found him on the bathroom floor with an empty bottle of medication next to him. He has a history of major depressive disorder. His only medication is nortriptyline. His pulse is 127/min and blood pressure is 90/61 mm Hg. Examination shows dilated pupils and dry skin. The abdomen is distended and there is dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region. An ECG shows tachycardia and a QRS complex width of 130 ms. In addition to intravenous fluid resuscitation, which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Atropine
(B): Naloxone
(C): Cyproheptadine
(D): Ammonium chloride
(E): Sodium bicarbonate
",Sodium bicarbonate,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Sodium bicarbonate.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose, which can cause anticholinergic effects (dilated pupils, dry skin), cardiovascular toxicity (tachycardia, widened QRS complex), and gastrointestinal effects (abdominal distension, dullness on percussion in the suprapubic region). The initial management of TCA overdose includes intravenous fluid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability. However, sodium bicarbonate is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case.

Sodium bicarbonate is used in TCA overdose to treat the cardiovascular toxicity caused by sodium channel blockade. TCAs inhibit fast sodium channels, leading to prolonged depolarization and widening of the QRS complex on the ECG. This can result in life-threatening arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Sodium bicarbonate works by increasing the extracellular pH, which reduces the binding of TCAs to sodium channels and promotes the dissociation of the drug from the channel. This helps to normalize the QRS complex width and prevent arrhythmias.

Atropine (choice A) is not indicated in this case because the patient's tachycardia is likely due to TCA toxicity rather than a primary bradycardia. Atropine is used to treat bradycardia by blocking the effects of the vagus nerve on the heart.

Naloxone (choice B) is used to reverse the effects of opioid overdose, but it is not effective in treating TCA toxicity.

Cyproheptadine (choice C) is an antihistamine that can be used as an antidote for serotonin syndrome, but it is not indicated in this case of TCA overdose.

Ammonium chloride (choice D) is used to treat metabolic alkalosis, which is not a feature of TCA overdose. It is not indicated in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case is sodium bicarbonate (choice E) to treat the cardiovascular toxicity associated with TCA overdose.",
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the hospital for elective surgery. However, due to an unexpected bleeding event, the physician had to order a blood transfusion to replace the blood lost in the surgery. After this, the patient became irritable and had difficulty breathing, suggesting an allergic reaction, which was immediately treated with epinephrine. This patient is otherwise healthy, and her history does not indicate any health conditions or known allergies. The physician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder that was not previously diagnosed. If serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, which of the following would be expected?
Options:
(A): High IgM, low IgA, and IgE
(B): Low IgA, high IgG, normal IgE
(C): Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM
(D): High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG
(E): Normal serum immunoglobulin values
","Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM",Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Low IgA, normal IgG, and IgM.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient experienced an allergic reaction after receiving a blood transfusion, suggesting a possible immunodeficiency disorder. One specific mechanism of immunodeficiency that can cause allergic transfusion reactions is the presence of class-specific IgG anti-IgA antibodies in patients who are IgA deficient. Selective IgA deficiency is a common immunodeficiency disorder, occurring in approximately 1 in 300 to 500 people. However, only a minority of IgA-deficient patients develop anti-IgA antibodies.

Therefore, if serum is taken from this patient to analyze her condition further, it would be expected to show low IgA levels due to selective IgA deficiency. The levels of IgG and IgM would be normal because the patient's history does not indicate any other immunodeficiency disorders.

High IgM, low IgA, and IgE (Option A) is incorrect because IgE levels are not necessarily elevated in selective IgA deficiency.

Low IgA, high IgG, normal IgE (Option B) is incorrect because IgG levels are not typically elevated in selective IgA deficiency.

High IgE, normal IgA, and IgG (Option D) is incorrect because IgE levels are not necessarily elevated in selective IgA deficiency.

Normal serum immunoglobulin values (Option E) is incorrect because selective IgA deficiency would result in low IgA levels.",
"A 21-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after being found unconscious in his apartment by his mother. On arrival, he is unable to provide history. The mother reports that there is no history of serious illness in the family. The patient appears drowsy and dehydrated. His temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 170/100 mm Hg. Examination shows several track marks on his forearms and large contusions over his forehead, legs, and back. There is blood coming from the mouth. The patient is catheterized and tea-colored urine is drained. Urinalysis shows:
Urine
pH 5.8
Specific gravity 1.045
Blood 3+
Glucose 3+
Proteins 1+
Ketones 1+
RBC none
WBC 0-1/hpf
Urine toxicology is positive for opiates and cocaine. Intravenous fluids and sodium nitroprusside drip are started. The patient is most likely to have which of the following?""
Options:
(A): Low serum potassium
(B): Low serum lactate dehydrogenase
(C): Low blood urea nitrogen
(D): Elevated serum calcium
(E): Elevated serum creatine kinase
",Elevated serum creatine kinase,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Elevated serum creatine kinase.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a drug overdose, as evidenced by the track marks, positive urine toxicology for opiates and cocaine, and the drowsiness and dehydration. The blood in the mouth may be due to trauma from the contusions or a complication of the drug overdose. The tea-colored urine is concerning for rhabdomyolysis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue. Rhabdomyolysis can be caused by drug toxicity, including cocaine, and can lead to the release of intracellular enzymes, such as creatine kinase, into the bloodstream.

Elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) is a marker of muscle damage and is commonly seen in rhabdomyolysis. In this case, the patient's contusions and the presence of blood in the urine suggest muscle injury, which is supported by the elevated CK levels. The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation or findings on urinalysis.",
"A 30-year-old G4P3 woman at 38 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery unit complaining of contractions every 5 minutes for the past hour. Her previous births have been via uncomplicated caesarean sections, but she wishes to attempt vaginal delivery this time. Her prenatal care is notable for gestational diabetes controlled with diet and exercise. The delivery is prolonged, but the patient's pain is controlled with epidural analgesia. She delivers a male infant with Apgar scores of 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Fundal massage is performed, but the placenta does not pass. The obstetrician manually removes the placenta, but a red mass protrudes through the vagina attached to the placenta. The patient loses 500 mL of blood over the next minute, during which her blood pressure decreases from 120/80 mmHg to 90/65 mmHg. What is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Uterine artery ligation
(B): Hysterectomy
(C): Intravenous oxytocin
(D): Elevate posterior fornix
(E): Red blood cell transfusion
",Elevate posterior fornix,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Elevate posterior fornix.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is experiencing a postpartum hemorrhage, which is a potentially life-threatening complication. The presence of a red mass protruding through the vagina suggests that the patient has a uterine inversion, which occurs when the uterus turns inside out after delivery of the placenta. This can lead to severe bleeding and hypotension.

Elevating the posterior fornix is the best next step in management for a uterine inversion. This maneuver involves manually pushing the inverted uterus back into its normal position. By doing so, the blood vessels that were compressed during the inversion are released, allowing for improved blood flow and decreased bleeding. It is important to perform this maneuver promptly to prevent further complications.

Uterine artery ligation (A) is not the best next step in management for a uterine inversion. While it may be necessary in cases of severe bleeding, it is not the initial step in managing a uterine inversion.

Hysterectomy (B) is not indicated as the initial step in managing a uterine inversion. It is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for cases where conservative measures have failed to control the bleeding.

Intravenous oxytocin (C) is not the best next step in management for a uterine inversion. While oxytocin can help to contract the uterus and control bleeding, it is not the primary intervention for a uterine inversion.

Red blood cell transfusion (E) may be necessary if the patient continues to bleed and becomes hemodynamically unstable. However, it is not the best next step in management for a uterine inversion. The priority is to correct the uterine inversion and control the bleeding.",
"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician to establish care. He recently moved to the area and has not been to a primary care physician for over 5 years. He has no history of serious illness, but has intermittent bilateral knee pain for which he takes 650 mg acetaminophen every other day. He is married with three children and is sexually active with his wife. During the past 10 years, he has unsuccessfully tried to lose weight. He has smoked one half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years. About 2–3 times per week he has 1–2 glasses of wine with dinner. He is 160 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 93 kg (205 lb); BMI is 36.3 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits.

Transabdominal ultrasonography shows a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these liver abnormalities?""
Options:
(A): Autoimmune liver damage
(B): Congestive hepatopathy
(C): Insulin resistance
(D): Acetaminophen use
(E): Alcohol use
",Insulin resistance,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Insulin resistance.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario has a mildly enlarged, diffusely hyperechoic liver, which is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is strongly associated with insulin resistance, which is characterized by decreased tissue sensitivity to insulin. Insulin resistance leads to increased hepatic lipogenesis and decreased hepatic fatty acid oxidation, resulting in the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver. This leads to the development of hepatic steatosis, which is the initial stage of NAFLD.

The patient's history is also suggestive of insulin resistance. He has a BMI of 36.3 kg/m2, which is classified as obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for insulin resistance. Additionally, the patient has a history of unsuccessful weight loss attempts, which further supports the presence of insulin resistance.

Other laboratory findings in the patient, such as an elevated hemoglobin A1c level of 6.3% and a history of intermittent bilateral knee pain, suggest the possibility of underlying metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes, both of which are associated with insulin resistance.

The other options listed (A) Autoimmune liver damage, (B) Congestive hepatopathy, (D) Acetaminophen use, and (E) Alcohol use are less likely to be the underlying cause of the liver abnormalities in this patient. There are no clinical or laboratory findings to suggest autoimmune liver damage, congestive hepatopathy, or acetaminophen use as the cause. While alcohol use can cause liver abnormalities, the patient's alcohol consumption is within moderate limits (2-3 glasses of wine per week) and is unlikely to be the primary cause of his liver abnormalities.",
"A 16-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance from a soccer game. During the game, he was about to kick the ball when another player collided with his leg from the front. He was unable to stand up after this collision and reported severe knee pain. On presentation, he was found to have a mild knee effusion. Physical exam showed that his knee could be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but it could not be pulled anteriorly in the same position. The anatomic structure that was most likely injured in this patient has which of the following characteristics?
Options:
(A): Runs anteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle
(B): Runs anteriorly from the medial femoral condyle
(C): Runs medially from the lateral femoral condyle
(D): Runs posteriorly from the lateral femoral condyle
(E): Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle
",Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's knee can be pushed posteriorly at 90 degrees of flexion but cannot be pulled anteriorly in the same position. This finding suggests an injury to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), which runs posteriorly from the medial femoral condyle. The PCL is one of the major ligaments in the knee and helps to stabilize the joint by preventing the tibia from moving too far backward in relation to the femur. Injuries to the PCL typically occur with a forceful blow to the front of the knee, such as in this case where the patient experienced a collision from the front. The presence of a mild knee effusion further supports the possibility of a PCL injury.",
"A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions presents to the emergency room with shortness of breath. He notes that he stopped taking his furosemide two weeks prior, because he ran out of pills. On exam, his oxygen saturation is 78%, his lungs have crackles throughout, and jugular venous pulsation is located at the earlobe. EKG and troponin levels are normal. Which of the following is consistent with this man's pulmonary physiology?
Options:
(A): Normal Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, normal diffusion distance
(B): Decreased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, normal diffusion distance
(C): Decreased Aa gradient, increased surface area for diffusion, decreased diffusion distance
(D): Increased Aa gradient, normal surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance
(E): Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance
","Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with pulmonary edema, which is caused by fluid accumulation in the lungs. The crackles on lung exam and low oxygen saturation indicate impaired gas exchange. The jugular venous pulsation at the earlobe suggests elevated left atrial pressure, which can be caused by left ventricular failure.

The A-a gradient is a measure of the difference in oxygen tension between the alveoli and the arterial blood. In this patient, the A-a gradient is likely increased due to impaired gas exchange caused by pulmonary edema.

Decreased surface area for diffusion refers to a reduction in the available area for gas exchange in the lungs. In this patient, the fluid-filled alveoli and interstitial spaces reduce the surface area for diffusion, contributing to impaired gas exchange.

Increased diffusion distance refers to an increase in the distance that oxygen must travel from the alveoli to the capillaries. In this patient, the fluid-filled alveoli and thickened interstitial spaces increase the diffusion distance, further impairing gas exchange.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E): Increased Aa gradient, decreased surface area for diffusion, increased diffusion distance.",
"A 50-year-old man presents to the office with complaints of fever and chills for 4 weeks. He adds that he is fatigued all the time and has generalized weakness.

",Babesiosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Babesiosis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fever, chills, fatigue, and generalized weakness, along with the laboratory findings of anemia (hemoglobin 11.2 g/dL, hematocrit 29%) and thrombocytopenia (platelet count 60,000/mm3), are consistent with a parasitic infection. The peripheral blood smear showing basophilic ring- and pear-shaped structures inside red cells and extracellular basophilic rings is highly suggestive of Babesiosis, which is caused by the protozoan parasite Babesia. Babesiosis is transmitted by the Ixodes tick, which is also responsible for transmitting Lyme disease. The patient's recent travel to the Netherlands, where Ixodes ticks are present, further supports the diagnosis of Babesiosis. Babesiosis can cause hemolytic anemia, as evidenced by the presence of schistocytes and poikilocytes on the peripheral blood smear. The elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase 200 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 355 IU/L) may be due to hepatic involvement in the infection. Babesiosis should be considered in patients with a history of tick exposure and symptoms consistent with a parasitic infection. Treatment typically involves a combination of atovaquone and azithromycin.",
"A 41-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath that is worse when she lies on her left side. About 10 days ago, she had an episode of unexplained loss of consciousness. Past medical history is negative and family history is irrelevant. Clinical examination shows a diastolic murmur, which is prominent when she lies on her left side. Jugular venous distention is present, and chest examination reveals fine crackles that do not clear with coughing. Chest X-ray shows pulmonary congestion, and 2-dimensional echocardiogram shows a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Rheumatic fever
(B): Innocent murmur
(C): Subacute infective endocarditis
(D): Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis
(E): Atrial myxoma
",Atrial myxoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Atrial myxoma.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of atrial myxoma. Atrial myxoma is the most common primary cardiac tumor and typically presents with symptoms related to obstruction of blood flow or embolization. The patient's shortness of breath, worse when lying on the left side, suggests pulmonary congestion, which is a common symptom of left atrial myxoma. The diastolic murmur, prominent when lying on the left side, is characteristic of a tumor obstructing the mitral valve. Jugular venous distention can occur due to increased left atrial pressure. The presence of fine crackles on chest examination suggests pulmonary edema. The chest X-ray findings of pulmonary congestion further support the diagnosis. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram showing a mass in the left atrium attached to the atrial septum is consistent with an atrial myxoma. Rheumatic fever is unlikely in this patient as there is no history of preceding streptococcal infection or other features of rheumatic fever. Innocent murmurs are typically systolic and do not cause symptoms or physical findings. Subacute infective endocarditis and non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis are less likely given the clinical presentation and echocardiogram findings.",
"A 25-year-old man presents with painless swelling of the neck for the past week. He reports no recent fevers, night sweats, or weight loss. His past medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, which was diagnosed last year. He also experienced a head trauma 5 years ago, which has been complicated by residual seizures. His only medication is daily phenytoin, which was restarted after he had a seizure 3 months ago. His temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉). On physical examination, multiple non-tender lymph nodes, averaging 2 cm in diameter, are found to be palpable in the anterior and posterior triangles of the neck bilaterally. No other lymphadenopathy is noted. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show the following:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8000/mm3 with a normal differential
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 40 mm/h
An excisional biopsy of one of the cervical lymph nodes is performed. The histopathologic analysis is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL)
(B): Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL)
(C): HIV lymphadenopathy
(D): Mononucleosis
(E): Phenytoin-induced adenopathy
",Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL),Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL).

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of HIV infection and the physical examination findings of painless, bilateral lymphadenopathy in the neck, the most likely diagnosis is Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL). Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that commonly presents with painless lymphadenopathy, most commonly in the cervical, supraclavicular, and mediastinal regions. It is more common in individuals with HIV infection, and the presence of HIV can affect the clinical presentation and prognosis of the disease. The histopathologic analysis of the excisional biopsy would show characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, multinucleated cells that are pathognomonic for Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Other findings that support this diagnosis include the absence of other lymphadenopathy, the lack of constitutional symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, and the normal laboratory findings, including the hemoglobin, leukocyte count, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) is unlikely in this patient as it typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, pallor, and bleeding, and the laboratory findings would show abnormal leukocyte counts and peripheral blood smear findings. HIV lymphadenopathy is a possibility, but the presence of painless, bilateral lymphadenopathy in the neck is more suggestive of Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Mononucleosis is unlikely in this patient as it typically presents with fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy that peaks in the first week and then gradually subsides over two to three weeks. Phenytoin-induced adenopathy is unlikely in this patient as the lymphadenopathy is not related to the use of phenytoin and the patient's history of HIV infection and the physical examination findings are more consistent with Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma.",
"A 67-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for urinary incontinence. She has been waking up every morning with her underwear soaked in urine. She notices that at work if she does not take regular bathroom breaks her underwear will have some urine in it. She urinates 5 to 11 times per day but she claims it is a small volume. Her current medications include lisinopril, metformin, insulin, aspirin, atorvastatin, sodium docusate, and loratadine. Her temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 167/108 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities and a systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization
(B): Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night
(C): No recommendations needed
(D): Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks
(E): Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics
",Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bethanechol and intermittent straight catheterization.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence, including waking up with soaked underwear and urine leakage with decreased bladder capacity, are consistent with overflow incontinence. Overflow incontinence occurs when the bladder is unable to empty completely, leading to urinary retention and subsequent leakage. The patient's decreased pinprick sensation in the lower extremities suggests a neurologic cause for her urinary retention, such as diabetic neuropathy. The systolic murmur along the right upper sternal border may indicate aortic stenosis, which can cause left ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent bladder dysfunction.

The best treatment for this patient is to address the underlying cause of her urinary retention, which is likely a combination of neurologic dysfunction and bladder outlet obstruction. Bethanechol, a cholinergic agonist, can help stimulate bladder contractions and improve bladder emptying. Intermittent straight catheterization should also be performed to ensure complete bladder emptying and prevent urinary retention. This combination of medication and catheterization is the most effective approach to managing overflow incontinence in this patient.

The other options are not the best treatment for this patient:
- Option (B) Bethanechol during the day and oxybutynin at night: Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication that can help relax the bladder and reduce urgency. However, it is not the best choice for this patient because it can worsen urinary retention in patients with bladder outlet obstruction. Using oxybutynin at night may also increase the risk of urinary retention during sleep.
- Option (C) No recommendations needed: This patient's symptoms of urinary incontinence and urinary retention require treatment.
- Option (D) Oxybutynin and scheduled bathroom breaks: Oxybutynin, as mentioned above, is not the best choice for this patient. Scheduled bathroom breaks alone may not be sufficient to address the underlying cause of urinary retention.
- Option (E) Reduce fluid intake and discontinue diuretics: While reducing fluid intake and discontinuing diuretics may help reduce the frequency of urination, it does not address the underlying cause of urinary retention in this patient. Additionally, reducing fluid intake can lead to dehydration and other complications.",
"A 55-year-old man presents into the emergency department with a severe cough and difficulty breathing. He says that he finds himself out of breath after taking a few steps, and has to sit down and rest, in order to continue. He also says that, at night, he has the greatest difficulty in breathing and usually uses at least 3 pillows to sleep comfortably. He mentions a cough that appears only at night, but which is persistent enough to wake him up from sleep. He mentions that he has had a ‘heart attack’ 5 years ago. He also says that he continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis even though his doctor has advised against it. He has brought his lab reports which he had recently got done on the suggestions of his family doctor. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and a chest X-ray are found. Which of the following is the next step in this patient’s management?
Options:
(A): Angiography
(B): Computed Tomography (CT)
(C): Echocardiogram
(D): Stress test
(E): Cardiac biopsy
",Echocardiogram,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Echocardiogram.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of severe cough, difficulty breathing, and orthopnea (needing multiple pillows to sleep comfortably), along with a history of a previous heart attack, the next step in this patient's management should be an echocardiogram.

An echocardiogram is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It can provide valuable information about the structure and function of the heart, including the size and shape of the heart chambers, the thickness of the heart walls, and the movement of the heart valves. It can also assess the overall pumping function of the heart.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and history suggest the possibility of heart failure, which is a condition where the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. Heart failure can be caused by various factors, including a previous heart attack, alcohol abuse, and other underlying heart conditions. An echocardiogram can help evaluate the extent of heart damage and assess the severity of heart failure.

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of cough and difficulty breathing, particularly at night, may be indicative of fluid accumulation in the lungs, which is a common manifestation of heart failure. An echocardiogram can help identify any abnormalities in the heart's structure or function that may be contributing to these symptoms.

Therefore, an echocardiogram is the most appropriate next step in this patient's management to further evaluate his cardiac function and determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.",
"A 2-day-old boy delivered at 34 weeks gestation is found to have a murmur on routine exam. He is lying supine and is not cyanotic. He has a pulse of 195/min, and respirations of 59/min. He is found to have a nonradiating continuous machine-like murmur at the left upper sternal border. S1 and S2 are normal. The peripheral pulses are bounding. Assuming this patient has no other cardiovascular defects, what is the most appropriate treatment?
Options:
(A): Indomethacin
(B): Thiazide diuretic
(C): Aspirin
(D): Penicillin
(E): Reassurance
",Indomethacin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Indomethacin.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation described in the question is consistent with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). A PDA is a persistent connection between the aorta and the pulmonary artery that should normally close shortly after birth. In premature infants, the closure of the ductus arteriosus may be delayed, leading to a PDA.

The characteristic murmur of a PDA is a continuous machine-like murmur heard at the left upper sternal border. The presence of bounding peripheral pulses and tachycardia (pulse of 195/min) suggests a significant left-to-right shunt through the PDA.

Indomethacin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and promotes closure of the ductus arteriosus. It is the treatment of choice for a symptomatic PDA in premature infants. In this case, the patient is described as being 2 days old and delivered at 34 weeks gestation, which makes him a premature infant.

Thiazide diuretics (B) are not indicated for the treatment of a PDA. They are used to treat conditions such as hypertension and edema.

Aspirin (C) is not the appropriate treatment for a PDA. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent and is not effective in closing a PDA.

Penicillin (D) is not indicated for the treatment of a PDA. Penicillin is an antibiotic and is not effective in closing a PDA.

Reassurance (E) is not the appropriate treatment for a symptomatic PDA. A significant left-to-right shunt through the PDA can lead to complications such as congestive heart failure and pulmonary hypertension if left untreated.",
"A 12-year-old girl is brought to your psychiatry office by her parents, who are concerned that she has not made any friends since starting middle school last year. The girl tells you that she gets nervous around other children, as she cannot tell what they are feeling, when they are joking, or what she has in common with them. Her teachers describe her as “easily distracted” and “easily upset by change.” When asked about her hobbies and interests, she states that “marine biology” is her only interest and gives you a 15-minute unsolicited explanation of how to identify different penguin species. Mental status exam is notable for intense eye contact, flat affect, and concrete thought process. Which of the following is true regarding this child’s disorder?
Options:
(A): Boys are more commonly affected than girls
(B): Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder
(C): Intellectual disability is a key feature of the disorder
(D): It is usually associated with a family history of schizophrenia
(E): Typical age of onset is 3-5 years of age
",Boys are more commonly affected than girls,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B) Impaired attention is a key feature of the disorder.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the child's symptoms are consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. 

The child's difficulty in understanding the emotions and intentions of others, as well as her struggle to make friends, are indicative of impaired social interaction, which is a core feature of ASD. Additionally, her intense interest in marine biology and her lengthy explanation about penguin species demonstrate restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.

The mention of being easily distracted and easily upset by change suggests impaired attention, which is commonly seen in individuals with ASD. This difficulty in attention can contribute to challenges in social interaction and communication.

It is important to note that ASD affects both boys and girls, so option (A) is incorrect. Intellectual disability can co-occur with ASD, but it is not a key feature of the disorder itself, making option (C) incorrect. While there may be a genetic component to ASD, it is not specifically associated with a family history of schizophrenia, making option (D) incorrect. The typical age of onset for ASD is before 3 years of age, making option (E) incorrect.",
"Four days after admission to the hospital for pneumonia, a 68-year-old woman develops abdominal pain and watery, foul-smelling diarrhea. Current medications include intravenous ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin. Stool cultures grow gram-positive, anaerobic rods. She is moved to an isolated hospital room. Sterilization with which of the following agents is most likely to prevent transmission of this pathogen to the next patient who will occupy her room?
Options:
(A): Chlorine-based solution
(B): Chlorhexidine-based solution
(C): Iodine-based solution
(D): Isopropanol-based solution
(E): Quaternary amine-based solution
",Chlorine-based solution,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Chlorine-based solution.

Explanation:
The patient in question has developed abdominal pain and watery, foul-smelling diarrhea, which is suggestive of a Clostridium difficile infection. Stool cultures have grown gram-positive, anaerobic rods, further supporting this diagnosis. Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming bacterium that can survive on surfaces and is highly contagious. Therefore, it is important to use a sterilization agent that is effective against spores to prevent transmission to the next patient.

Chlorine-based solutions, such as bleach, are known to be effective against Clostridium difficile spores. They have strong antimicrobial properties and can effectively kill the bacteria and its spores on surfaces. Chlorhexidine-based solutions, iodine-based solutions, isopropanol-based solutions, and quaternary amine-based solutions may have antimicrobial properties, but they are not as effective against spores as chlorine-based solutions.

Therefore, using a chlorine-based solution for sterilization is the most likely to prevent transmission of this pathogen to the next patient who will occupy the room.",
"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her parents. They are concerned that she becomes lethargic and irritated between meals. They found that feeding her often with small servings helps. She was born at 39 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is meeting all developmental milestones. Her mother has one brother that occasionally requires blood transfusions. Today, her blood pressure is 55/33 mm Hg, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the infant is irritated. She is slightly jaundiced. Her heart has a regular rate and rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Her blood work shows normocytic anemia with elevated reticulocyte count and decreased haptoglobin. Sickle cell anemia and other hemoglobinopathies are also ruled out. A Coombs test is negative. Red blood cell osmotic fragility gap is normal. The physician determined that these findings are related to an enzyme deficiency. Which of the following allosterically inhibits this enzyme?
Options:
(A): Alanine
(B): Adenosine diphosphate
(C): Adenosine monophosphate
(D): Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
(E): Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
",Alanine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Alanine.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a 1-month-old girl with lethargy, irritability between meals, normocytic anemia, elevated reticulocyte count, and decreased haptoglobin is suggestive of hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (HNSHA) due to pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency. PK is an enzyme involved in the glycolytic pathway, specifically in the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate. This deficiency leads to a decreased production of ATP, causing red blood cell (RBC) membrane instability and hemolysis.

PK is allosterically inhibited by alanine. Alanine acts as a negative regulator of PK activity, reducing the enzyme's affinity for its substrate, phosphoenolpyruvate. This inhibition helps to regulate the glycolytic pathway and prevent excessive ATP production.

Therefore, in this case, the enzyme deficiency causing the clinical findings is PK deficiency, and the allosteric inhibitor of PK is alanine.",
"A 4-year-old boy presents for a routine checkup. The patient’s parents say he was doing well until a few weeks ago at which time he started to complain of daily abdominal cramps and occasional muscle pains. His mother also noticed that he has been less active than usual. The parents deny any complaints of headaches or convulsions. The family lives together in a house built in 1950. The patient’s temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg, pulse is 100/min and respirations are 20/min. Abdominal exam shows mild diffuse tenderness to palpation and normal bowel sounds. The patient’s height, weight, and head circumference are normal. Laboratory results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 7 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 72
Lead level (capillary blood) 15 mcg/dL
Lead level (venous blood) 60 mcg/dL
Findings on a peripheral blood smear are shown in the image. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?
Options:
(A): Trientine
(B): Calcium disodium edetate (EDTA)
(C): Dimercaprol
(D): Penicillamine
(E): Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer
","Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer",Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory results, this patient is most likely suffering from lead poisoning. Lead poisoning can cause abdominal pain, muscle pain, and decreased activity levels. The laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level and a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), which are consistent with lead poisoning. The lead levels in both capillary and venous blood are elevated, further supporting the diagnosis.

The best treatment option for lead poisoning in this patient is Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), also known as succimer. DMSA is a chelating agent that binds to lead and facilitates its excretion in the urine. It is the preferred treatment for children with blood lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL or with symptomatic lead poisoning. DMSA is administered orally and has a good safety profile.

Trientine (option A) is a chelating agent used for the treatment of Wilson disease, not lead poisoning.

Calcium disodium edetate (EDTA) (option B) is another chelating agent that can be used for lead poisoning, but it is not the best option in this case. EDTA is typically reserved for patients with severe lead poisoning or with blood lead levels greater than 70 mcg/dL.

Dimercaprol (option C) and penicillamine (option D) are chelating agents that have been used in the past for the treatment of lead poisoning, but they are not the best options in this case. DMSA (succimer) is now considered the preferred treatment for lead poisoning due to its oral administration and good safety profile.",
"A 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to her rheumatologist for a follow-up visit. She has had intermittent myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and skin rashes over the past 10 years that have acutely worsened over the past year. She works as a school teacher but reports that she has had to miss several days of work due to her symptoms. She has been on hydroxychloroquine for several years but does not feel that it is adequately controlling her symptoms. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 18/min. On exam, she is well-appearing and in no acute distress. She has erythematous, raised plaques with keratotic scaling and follicular plugging on her hands. The physician decides to trial the patient on low-dose prednisone to better control her symptoms. At 2 months of follow-up, she reports that her flares have subsided and she has been able to return to work full-time. If this patient continues this medication regimen, she will be at an elevated risk for developing which of the following?
Options:
(A): Femoral neck fracture
(B): Femoral shaft fracture
(C): Meniscal tear
(D): Osgood-Schlatter disease
(E): Proximal phalanx fracture
",Femoral neck fracture,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Femoral neck fracture.

Explanation:
Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at an increased risk of developing fractures, particularly femoral neck fractures. The risk of fracture in patients with SLE is five times that of the general population. Osteopenia and osteoporosis, which are common in SLE, contribute to the increased fracture risk. Glucocorticoid use, such as low-dose prednisone, further increases the risk of fractures. In this case, the patient has been started on low-dose prednisone to control her symptoms, which puts her at an elevated risk for developing a femoral neck fracture. It is important to monitor bone health and consider preventive measures, such as calcium and vitamin D supplementation, in patients with SLE who are on long-term glucocorticoid therapy.",
"A 40-year-old woman presents with severe shortness of breath. The patient is unable to provide a history due to her breathing difficulties. The patient’s roommate says that she came home and found her in this state. She also says that they both occasionally take sleeping pills to help them fall asleep. Physical examination reveals an obese female, dyspneic with diminished chest wall movements. The patient’s A-a gradient is calculated to be 10 mm Hg. Which of the following most likely accounts for this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Alveolar hypoperfusion
(B): Alveolar hypoventilation
(C): Impaired gas diffusion
(D): Left-to-right blood shunt
(E): Right-to-left blood shunt
",Alveolar hypoventilation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Alveolar hypoventilation.

Explanation:
The patient's severe shortness of breath, obesity, and diminished chest wall movements suggest a respiratory problem. The fact that the patient's A-a gradient is calculated to be 10 mm Hg indicates a normal oxygenation of the alveoli. This rules out options A (Alveolar hypoperfusion), C (Impaired gas diffusion), D (Left-to-right blood shunt), and E (Right-to-left blood shunt).

Alveolar hypoventilation occurs when there is inadequate ventilation of the alveoli, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and a decrease in oxygen (O2) levels in the blood. This can result in severe shortness of breath and dyspnea. The patient's use of sleeping pills may contribute to the hypoventilation by depressing the respiratory drive.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms is alveolar hypoventilation.",
"A 74-year-old woman is brought to her primary care doctor by her adult son. The son says she has been very difficult at home and is ""losing it"". He seems very frustrated about her diminishing ability to take care of herself the way she used to and no longer thinks he can trust her watching his children. At her last visit you noted mild cognitive impairment. Today, she appears withdrawn and hesitates to make eye-contact with you. She lets her son do most of the talking. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Options:
(A): Discuss with the son the challenges of having a parent with dementia
(B): Complete a mini-mental exam
(C): Assess the patient's risk for depression
(D): Order a head CT
(E): Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone
",Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Ask the son to step out so you can speak with the patient alone.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is exhibiting signs of withdrawal and hesitancy to make eye contact, which may indicate that she is uncomfortable speaking openly in the presence of her son. Asking the son to step out will create a safe and confidential environment for the patient to express her concerns and feelings without any potential influence or pressure from her son. This will allow the healthcare provider to gather more accurate information about her symptoms and concerns, which will help in making an appropriate diagnosis and developing a treatment plan. Additionally, it is important to respect the patient's autonomy and give her the opportunity to speak for herself.",
"An investigator is studying the effects of different gastrointestinal regulatory substances. A healthy subject is asked to eat a meal at hour 0, and the pH of stomach contents and rate of stomach acid secretions are measured over the next 4 hours. Results of the study are shown. Which of the following mechanisms most likely contributes to the changes seen at point D in the graph?
Options:
(A): Increased vagal stimulation
(B): Increased activity of D cells
(C): Increased activation of H2 receptors
(D): Increased activity of enterochromaffin-like cells
(E): Increased activity of I cells
",Increased activity of D cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Increased activity of D cells.

Explanation:
According to the provided context information, the principal stimulus for activation of D cells is antral luminal acidification. D cells release somatostatin, which inhibits histamine release from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells and gastrin release from G cells. Histamine, released from ECL cells, stimulates gastric acid secretion. Therefore, increased activity of D cells would lead to a decrease in histamine release and subsequently a decrease in gastric acid secretion. This is consistent with the decrease in pH and rate of stomach acid secretion seen at point D in the graph.",
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass?
Options:
(A): Undifferentiated giant cells
(B): Capsular invasion
(C): Psammoma bodies
(D): Infiltration of atypical lymphoid tissue
(E): Orphan Annie nuclei
""
",Capsular invasion,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Capsular invasion.

Explanation:
Capsular invasion refers to the invasion of the tumor into the capsule surrounding the thyroid gland. In this case, the histopathological examination of the thyroid tumor showed invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. This indicates that the tumor has breached the capsule and has the potential to spread beyond the thyroid gland. Capsular invasion is a characteristic feature of aggressive thyroid cancers, such as papillary thyroid carcinoma.",
"A 53-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up visit. She has no complaints and her past medical history is notable for diabetes and hypertension. During this visit, the patient undergoes screening procedures per guidelines including a mammogram. On the screening mammogram a spiculated, irregular mass is found on the left breast. Further diagnostic mammography and biopsy reveal ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. Which of the following is the most important factor in determining this patient’s prognosis?
Options:
(A): Tumor grade
(B): Tumor stage
(C): Age
(D): History of diabetes
(E): Location of the tumor on the breast
",Tumor stage,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Tumor stage.

Explanation:
Tumor stage is the most important factor in determining a patient's prognosis in breast cancer. Tumor stage refers to the extent of the cancer, including the size of the tumor, whether it has spread to nearby lymph nodes, and whether it has metastasized to other parts of the body. 

The stage of breast cancer helps determine the appropriate treatment options and provides valuable information about the patient's prognosis. Generally, the earlier the stage of breast cancer, the better the prognosis. 

In this case, the patient's mammogram revealed a spiculated, irregular mass in the left breast, and further diagnostic tests confirmed ductal adenocarcinoma. The tumor stage, which includes the size of the tumor and whether it has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body, will provide crucial information about the patient's prognosis and guide the treatment plan. 

Tumor grade (A) is also an important factor in determining prognosis, as it assesses the aggressiveness of the cancer cells. However, tumor stage is considered more important in determining prognosis. 

Age (C) and history of diabetes (D) may be relevant factors in considering treatment options and managing the patient's overall health, but they are not the most important factors in determining prognosis. 

The location of the tumor on the breast (E) is important for surgical planning and determining the extent of the cancer, but it is not the most important factor in determining prognosis.",
"A 2-month-old girl is brought to the pediatrician by her concerned father. He states that ever since her uncomplicated delivery she has failed to gain weight, has had chronic diarrhea, and has had multiple bacterial and viral infections. During the course of the workup, an absent thymic shadow is noted and a lymph node biopsy demonstrates the absence of germinal centers. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Defect in WASP gene
(B): Defect in ATM gene
(C): Adenosine deaminase deficiency
(D): NADPH oxidase deficiency
(E): Defect in BTK gene
",Adenosine deaminase deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Adenosine deaminase deficiency.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms, including failure to gain weight, chronic diarrhea, and recurrent infections, along with the absent thymic shadow and absence of germinal centers on lymph node biopsy, are consistent with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). SCID is a group of inherited disorders characterized by defects in both T-cell and B-cell function, leading to severe immunodeficiency. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is one of the most common causes of SCID. ADA is an enzyme involved in the purine salvage pathway, and its deficiency leads to the accumulation of toxic metabolites that are particularly toxic to lymphocytes. This results in impaired lymphocyte development and function, leading to the clinical manifestations seen in this patient.",
"A 1-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents for a regular check-up. His weight, height, and head size were found to be in the lower percentile ranges on standard growth curves. His hair is tangled and has a dry, brittle texture. Genetic testing reveals that the patient has a connective tissue disorder caused by impaired copper absorption and transport. The patient’s disorder is caused by a mutation in which of the following genes?
Options:
(A): ATP7A
(B): COL1A2
(C): COL5A1
(D): FBN1
(E): ATP7B
",ATP7A,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (E) ATP7B.

Explanation:
The patient's disorder is caused by impaired copper absorption and transport, which is characteristic of Wilson disease. Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene. This gene codes for a copper-transporting ATPase, which is responsible for exporting copper from various cell types. Mutations in ATP7B lead to impaired copper excretion from the liver, resulting in copper accumulation in various organs, including the liver, brain, eyes, kidneys, and skeleton. This accumulation of copper leads to the clinical manifestations of Wilson disease, such as hepatocellular dysfunction, neurologic symptoms, and connective tissue abnormalities. Therefore, the correct gene mutation associated with this patient's disorder is ATP7B.",
"A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not had a menstrual period. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 57 kg (125 lb); BMI is 21 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the breasts shows a secondary mound formed by the nipple and areola. Pubic hair is sparse and lightly pigmented. Abdominal examination shows bilateral firm, nontender inguinal masses. Pelvic examination shows a blind-ended vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Spironolactone therapy
(B): Gonadectomy
(C): Testosterone therapy
(D): Vaginal dilatory therapy
(E): Prednisolone therapy
",Gonadectomy,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Gonadectomy.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient presents with primary amenorrhea, which is the absence of menstruation by age 15 in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics or by age 13 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics. The physical examination findings of sparse and lightly pigmented pubic hair, a blind-ended vaginal pouch, and absence of a uterus or ovaries on ultrasonography suggest the diagnosis of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome.

MRKH syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina in females with a normal 46,XX karyotype. It is typically associated with normal secondary sexual characteristics and normal ovarian function. The most appropriate treatment for MRKH syndrome is gonadectomy, which involves the removal of the nonfunctional gonads (ovaries) to prevent the development of malignancy. Hormone replacement therapy (estrogen and progesterone) is usually initiated after gonadectomy to induce the development of secondary sexual characteristics and maintain bone health.

Spironolactone therapy (choice A) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used to treat conditions such as hypertension and edema. It is not indicated for the treatment of MRKH syndrome.

Testosterone therapy (choice C) is used to induce virilization in transgender individuals. It is not indicated for the treatment of MRKH syndrome.

Vaginal dilatory therapy (choice D) is used to treat vaginal agenesis or stenosis, which is not the primary concern in this patient with MRKH syndrome.

Prednisolone therapy (choice E) is a corticosteroid that is used to treat a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It is not indicated for the treatment of MRKH syndrome.",
"A 51-year-old man presents the emergency room with chest pain. He mentions that the pain started several hours ago and radiates to his left neck and shoulder. He also mentions that he has some difficulty in breathing. He says that he has had similar chest pains before, but nothing seemed to be wrong at that time. He was diagnosed with high cholesterol during that episode and was prescribed medication. He also has a 3-year history of gastritis. The blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, respirations are 18/min, and the pulse is 110/min. He seems a little anxious. The physical examination reveals no significant abnormalities. An ECG shows slight changes in the leads. His physician talks to him about the benefits of taking low-dose aspirin daily. Which of the following would be a contraindication to the use of aspirin in this patient?
Options:
(A): ECG changes
(B): Hypercholesterolemia
(C): Gastritis
(D): Increased pulse rate
(E): Age above 50 years
",Gastritis,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Gastritis.

Explanation:
Gastritis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the stomach lining. Aspirin is known to irritate the stomach lining and can worsen gastritis symptoms or even cause gastric ulcers. Therefore, in a patient with a history of gastritis, the use of aspirin would be contraindicated.

Option (A): ECG changes are not a contraindication to the use of aspirin. ECG changes can indicate cardiac abnormalities, and aspirin is often prescribed to patients with suspected or confirmed cardiac conditions to prevent blood clot formation.

Option (B): Hypercholesterolemia is not a contraindication to the use of aspirin. In fact, the patient's history of high cholesterol makes him a candidate for aspirin therapy, as it can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

Option (D): Increased pulse rate is not a contraindication to the use of aspirin. A rapid pulse rate can be a sign of anxiety or increased sympathetic activity, but it does not directly affect the use of aspirin.

Option (E): Age above 50 years is not a contraindication to the use of aspirin. In fact, the patient's age and history of chest pain make him a candidate for aspirin therapy, as it can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.",
"A 45-year-old woman presents to the physician for a follow-up visit. She has no specific complaints at this visit however, she has noticed that she is more tired than usual these days. At first, she ignored it and attributed it to stress but she feels weaker each week. She is sometimes out of breath while walking for long distances or when she is involved in strenuous physical activity. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 3 years ago and has since been on medication to assist with her pain and to slow down disease progression. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), the respiratory rate is 15/min, the pulse is 107/min, and the blood pressure is 102/98 mm Hg. On examination, you notice thinning hair and mildly cool extremities with flattened nail beds. A complete blood count and iron studies are ordered. Which of the following is most likely to show up on her iron profile?
Options:
(A): Increased iron-binding capacity
(B): Low ferritin levels
(C): Increased iron levels
(D): Decreased iron-binding capacity
(E): Normal iron-binding capacity
",Decreased iron-binding capacity,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Decreased iron-binding capacity.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath, along with the physical examination findings of thinning hair and flattened nail beds, are suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is a common complication of chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. In this condition, there is a decrease in the body's iron stores, leading to a decrease in the production of red blood cells and hemoglobin.

When iron deficiency is present, the body responds by increasing iron-binding capacity, which is the ability of transferrin (a protein that transports iron in the blood) to bind to iron. This is done in an attempt to increase iron absorption from the diet and replenish the body's iron stores. Therefore, option (A) is incorrect.

Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in the body. In iron deficiency anemia, ferritin levels are typically low as the body's iron stores are depleted. Therefore, option (B) is correct.

Option (C) is incorrect because increased iron levels would not be expected in iron deficiency anemia.

Option (E) is incorrect because in iron deficiency anemia, the iron-binding capacity is typically increased, not normal.

In summary, the most likely finding on the patient's iron profile would be a decreased iron-binding capacity, indicating iron deficiency anemia.",
"An 89-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of diarrhea and weakness for 4 days. She has 2–3 loose stools every day. She has also had 3 episodes of vomiting. She complains of a headache and blurry vision. Three weeks ago, she returned from a cruise trip to the Bahamas. She has congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, age-related macular degeneration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure. Current medications include warfarin, metoprolol, insulin, digoxin, ramipril, and spironolactone. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 61/min, and blood pressure is 108/74 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is diffuse, mild tenderness to palpation. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Leukocyte count 7200/mm3
Platelet count 230,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 137 mEq/L
K+ 5.2 mEq/L
Glucose 141 mg/dL
Creatinine 1.3 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Perform hemodialysis
(B): Perform CT scan of the abdomen
(C): Perform C. difficile toxin assay
(D): Measure serum drug concentration
(E): Administer oral activated charcoal
",Measure serum drug concentration,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Measure serum drug concentration.

Explanation:
This patient presents with diarrhea and weakness, which could be indicative of a drug-induced adverse reaction. Given her multiple comorbidities and extensive medication list, it is important to consider the possibility of drug-drug interactions or drug toxicity. The next step in management should be to measure the serum drug concentration to assess for potential drug toxicity. This will help identify any medications that may be contributing to her symptoms and guide further management decisions. Hemodialysis (choice A) may be indicated in cases of severe drug toxicity or overdose, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this patient. A CT scan of the abdomen (choice B) would not be indicated based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings. Performing a C. difficile toxin assay (choice C) would be appropriate if the patient had risk factors for C. difficile infection or if her symptoms were suggestive of this infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Administering oral activated charcoal (choice E) would be indicated in cases of acute drug overdose, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this patient.",
"A 45-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband due to upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting for the past couple of hours. She had similar episodes in the past, which were often precipitated by food but resolved spontaneously. Her temperature is 38.3°C (101.0°F), heart rate is 96/min, blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 16/min. Physical examination reveals tenderness over the right upper quadrant that is severe enough to make her stop breathing when deeply palpated in the area. Lab results show:
Leukocyte count 18,000/mm3 with 79% neutrophils
Aspartate aminotransferase 67 IU/L
Alanine aminotransferase 71 IU/L
Serum amylase 46 U/L
Serum Lipase 55 U/L
Serum calcium 8.9 mg/dL
Ultrasonography of the abdomen is shown below. During the ultrasound exam, the patient complains of tenderness when the probe presses down on her right upper quadrant. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her pain?
Options:
(A): Acute calculous cholecystitis
(B): Acute acalculous cholecystitis
(C): Biliary colic
(D): Acute pancreatitis
(E): Ascending cholangitis
",Acute calculous cholecystitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Acute calculous cholecystitis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute calculous cholecystitis. Acute calculous cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder caused by obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. The classic presentation includes right upper quadrant pain, fever, and leukocytosis. The pain is often severe and can radiate to the right shoulder or back. Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are also common. The pain is typically precipitated by a fatty meal and can last for several hours. Physical examination may reveal tenderness over the right upper quadrant, and Murphy's sign (inspiratory arrest during deep palpation of the right upper quadrant due to pain) may be present. Laboratory findings may include leukocytosis with a left shift and mildly elevated liver enzymes. Ultrasonography is the initial imaging modality of choice and may show gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and sonographic Murphy's sign. Treatment includes intravenous fluids, analgesia, and antibiotics. Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment.",
"A mother brings her 18-year-old daughter to your office because she has not menstruated yet. They recently immigrated from another country, and do not have any previous medical records. The adolescent girl looks relatively short, but otherwise looks healthy. She has no complaints except for mild intermittent lower abdominal pain for the past year. On physical examination, vitals are within normal limits. There is the presence of axillary hair, breast development, and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5. You explain to the mother and the patient that you need to perform a complete vaginal examination, however, both of them declined the procedure and would prefer that lab test be performed. Her labs are significant for the following:
FSH 7 mIU/mL
Normal values:  
   Follicular phase 3.1 – 7.9 mIU/mL
   Ovulation peak 2.3 – 18.5 mIU/mL
   Luteal phase 1.4 – 5.5 mIU/mL
   Postmenopausal 30.6 – 106.3 mIU/mL
Estradiol 28 pg/mL
Normal values:  
   Mid-follicular phase 27 – 123 pg/mL
   Periovulatory 96 – 436 pg/mL
   Mid-luteal phase 49 – 294 pg/mL
   Postmenopausal 0 – 40 pg/mL
Testosterone 52 ng/dL, 40 – 60 ng/dL
What is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
Options:
(A): Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)
(B): Muellerian agenesis
(C): Hyperprolactinemia
(D): Turner syndrome
(E): Androgen insensitivity
",Muellerian agenesis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Muellerian agenesis.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with primary amenorrhea, which is defined as the absence of menstruation by age 16 in the presence of normal secondary sexual characteristics or by age 14 in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics. The physical examination findings of breast development and pubic hair at Tanner stage 5 indicate normal estrogen production. However, the absence of menstruation suggests an anatomic abnormality that is preventing the outflow of menstrual blood. 

The laboratory results are also helpful in narrowing down the diagnosis. The FSH level of 7 mIU/mL is within the normal range for the follicular phase, indicating that the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis is functioning appropriately. The estradiol level of 28 pg/mL is low, but this can be explained by the absence of menstruation. The testosterone level of 52 ng/dL is within the normal range for females.

Given the physical examination findings and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Muellerian agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This is a congenital condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. It is often associated with normal secondary sexual characteristics and normal ovarian function. The lower abdominal pain reported by the patient may be due to the presence of endometriosis, which can occur in patients with MRKH syndrome.

Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is unlikely in this patient because her FSH level is within the normal range. POI is characterized by elevated FSH levels (>30 mIU/mL) and low estradiol levels (<20 pg/mL). Hyperprolactinemia is also unlikely because the patient's prolactin level was not provided and there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of hyperprolactinemia. Turner syndrome is characterized by short stature, primary amenorrhea, and ovarian dysgenesis, but it is typically associated with elevated FSH levels and low estradiol levels. Androgen insensitivity is characterized by the inability of androgens to bind to their receptors, resulting in incomplete masculinization of the external genitalia in individuals with XY chromosomes. This condition is not consistent with the patient's physical examination findings.",
"A 62-year-old woman with a pancreatic insulinoma is being prepared for a laparoscopic enucleation of the tumor. After induction of general anesthesia, preparation of a sterile surgical field, and port placement, the surgeon needs to enter the space posterior to the stomach to access the pancreatic tumor. Which of the following ligaments must be cut in order to access this space?
Options:
(A): Phrenoesophageal ligament
(B): Gastrohepatic ligament
(C): Phrenicocolic ligament
(D): Ligamentum venosum
(E): Falciform ligament
""
",Gastrohepatic ligament,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Gastrohepatic ligament.

Explanation:
To access the space posterior to the stomach and reach the pancreatic tumor, the surgeon needs to cut the gastrohepatic ligament. The gastrohepatic ligament connects the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and needs to be divided to enter the lesser sac, which is the space posterior to the stomach. Cutting the gastrohepatic ligament allows for exposure and access to the posterior surface of the stomach and the pancreas.",
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by his wife for severe abdominal pain for the past 1 hour. He is unable to give more information about the nature of his pain. His wife says that he has peptic ulcer disease and is being treated with antacids without a good response. She adds that he vomited repeatedly  in the last couple of hours, his vomitus being brown/red in color. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), respiratory rate is 16/min, pulse is 97/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. A physical exam reveals a tense abdomen with a board like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness. An erect abdominal x-ray is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Duodenal peptic ulcer
(B): Gastric peptic ulcer
(C): Pancreatitis
(D): Perforated gastric peptic ulcer
(E): Choledocholithiasis
",Perforated gastric peptic ulcer,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Perforated gastric peptic ulcer.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a perforated gastric peptic ulcer. The severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and brown/red vomitus are indicative of a perforation in the stomach, allowing gastric contents to leak into the peritoneal cavity. The tense abdomen with board-like rigidity and positive rebound tenderness are signs of peritonitis, which occurs when the peritoneum becomes inflamed due to the leakage of gastric contents. The erect abdominal x-ray may show free air under the diaphragm, which is a classic finding in perforated peptic ulcers. 

Duodenal peptic ulcers typically present with epigastric pain that is relieved by food intake or antacids. Gastric peptic ulcers may cause similar symptoms, but the presentation in this case is more consistent with a perforation. Pancreatitis typically presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, and it is not associated with the specific findings of a tense abdomen and positive rebound tenderness. Choledocholithiasis, or gallstones in the common bile duct, may cause abdominal pain and vomiting, but it is not associated with the signs of peritonitis seen in this patient.",
"A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient?
Options:
(A): Begin aspirin therapy
(B): Begin clopidogrel
(C): Carotid endarterectomy
(D): Begin warfarin and heparin
(E): Begin warfarin
",Begin warfarin and heparin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Begin warfarin and heparin.

Explanation:
This patient has a history of ischemic stroke and is now presenting with episodes of palpitations. The irregular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination suggest the possibility of atrial fibrillation (AF), which is a known risk factor for embolic stroke. The most appropriate intervention to prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient is anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin.

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that inhibits the synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X. It is commonly used for long-term anticoagulation in patients with AF to reduce the risk of stroke. Heparin, on the other hand, is a rapid-acting anticoagulant that can be used initially to quickly achieve therapeutic anticoagulation while waiting for the warfarin to reach its full effect.

Aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that are commonly used for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). However, in this patient with new-onset palpitations and possible AF, anticoagulation with warfarin and heparin is the more appropriate choice to prevent future CVAs.

Carotid endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that is indicated for patients with significant carotid artery stenosis (>70%) and a history of TIA or stroke. It is not the most appropriate intervention for this patient, as the CT scan did not show evidence of carotid artery stenosis.

In summary, given the patient's history of ischemic stroke and new-onset palpitations, the most appropriate intervention to prevent future CVAs is anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin.",
"In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?
Options:
(A): Retrospective cohort
(B): Meta-analysis
(C): Cross-sectional
(D): Case-control
(E): Genome-wide association study
",Case-control,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Case-control.

Explanation:
This study design is a case-control study. In a case-control study, researchers start with a group of individuals who have a specific outcome (in this case, breast cancer) and compare them to a group of individuals without the outcome (in this case, without breast cancer). The researchers then look back in time to determine if there were any differences in exposure or risk factors between the two groups. In this study, the researchers compared the proportion of women who had undergone bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy in the group with breast cancer (cases) to the proportion in the group without breast cancer (controls). They found that the odds of undergoing the procedure were lower in the group with breast cancer, suggesting a potential protective effect against breast cancer.",
"A 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred to a urologist. The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin. If one considers pulmonary nodules that are the same size as this patient’s, which of the following additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules?
Options:
(A): Lamellated calcification
(B): ‘Popcorn’ pattern
(C): Subsolid component
(D): Extending fine striations
(E): Doubling time of < 1 month
",Extending fine striations,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Extending fine striations.

Explanation:
Extending fine striations on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of pulmonary nodules. Extending fine striations are a characteristic finding of pulmonary metastases, which are common in patients with prostate cancer. The presence of extending fine striations suggests that the nodules are growing and spreading, indicating a more aggressive disease process. Prompt removal of these nodules would be necessary to prevent further spread of the cancer and potential complications.",
"A 35-year-old man presents with a 7 month history of insomnia. The patient admitted to having trouble sleeping from a young age but became more aware of how much this is affecting his health after attending a sleep conference earlier this year. He is worried that his health has suffered because of this, and he is also concerned that he will not be able to pay his bills if he were to get sick. He has no past medical or psychiatric condition and is not known to use any recreational drugs. The patient arrived for his appointment an hour early because he was afraid he might miss it. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination reveals an irritable middle age man who is tense and somewhat inattentive during the interview. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
 
Options:
(A): Generalized anxiety disorder
(B): Adjustment disorder
(C): Social anxiety 
(D): Agoraphobia
(E): Normal worry
",Generalized anxiety disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Generalized anxiety disorder.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient has a 7-month history of insomnia and has had trouble sleeping from a young age. This suggests a chronic issue rather than an acute stressor, making options B (Adjustment disorder) and C (Social anxiety) less likely. Additionally, the patient's worry about his health and financial stability, as well as his early arrival for the appointment due to fear of missing it, indicate excessive and uncontrollable worry, which are characteristic symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The patient's irritability and inattentiveness during the interview further support the diagnosis of GAD. Option D (Agoraphobia) is unlikely as there is no mention of fear or avoidance of specific places or situations. Option E (Normal worry) is incorrect as the patient's worry is excessive and interfering with his daily life.",
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the cardiologist because of sweating and respiratory distress while eating. She is at the 30th percentile for height and 15th percentile for weight. Echocardiography shows a defect in the membranous portion of the interventricular septum and a moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. Physical examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching
(B): Wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound
(C): Systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis
(D): Diastolic murmur preceded by opening snap
(E): Continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound
",Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Systolic murmur that increases with hand clenching.

Explanation:
The physical examination findings described in the question are consistent with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD is a common congenital heart defect characterized by an abnormal opening in the septum between the ventricles. 

In infants and children with VSD, a systolic murmur is typically heard. This murmur is caused by the turbulent flow of blood through the defect during ventricular contraction. The murmur is usually best heard at the left lower sternal border and may radiate to the back. 

The fact that the murmur increases with hand clenching is a characteristic finding in VSD. Hand clenching increases systemic vascular resistance, which in turn increases the left-to-right shunting of blood through the defect, leading to an increase in the intensity of the murmur. This phenomenon is known as the ""hand grip effect"" and is a classic feature of VSD.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation of VSD. Wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound (option B) is typically seen in atrial septal defects, not VSD. A systolic murmur that increases with forced exhalation against a closed glottis (option C) is characteristic of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, not VSD. A diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap (option D) is suggestive of mitral stenosis, not VSD. A continuous murmur that is loudest at the second heart sound (option E) is characteristic of a patent ductus arteriosus, not VSD.",
"A 58-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of increasing shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough for the last week. Three weeks ago, he had a fever and a cough for 6 days after he returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. He has had a 4-kg (9-lb) weight loss over the past 3 months. He has bronchial asthma and hypertension. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 41 years. Current medications include an albuterol inhaler and enalapril. His temperature is 37.6°C (99.7°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 136/89 mm Hg. There is dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Chest x-ray of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Elevation of diaphragm
(B): Ground glass appearance
(C): Widened intercostal spaces
(D): Deep sulcus sign
(E): Blunting of costophrenic angle
",Blunting of costophrenic angle,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Blunting of costophrenic angle.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a possible diagnosis of pleural effusion. Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath and cough. The dullness to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and decreased tactile fremitus over the left lung base are indicative of a pleural effusion.

On a chest x-ray, the most likely finding in a patient with a pleural effusion is blunting of the costophrenic angle. The costophrenic angle is the sharp angle formed by the diaphragm and the chest wall. In a normal chest x-ray, the costophrenic angle is sharp and well-defined. However, in the presence of a pleural effusion, the fluid accumulates in the dependent areas of the pleural space, causing blunting of the costophrenic angle. This is seen as a loss of the sharp angle and a rounding of the diaphragm at the lung base.

The other options are not consistent with the findings of a pleural effusion. Elevation of the diaphragm is not typically seen in pleural effusion. Ground glass appearance is more commonly associated with interstitial lung disease. Widened intercostal spaces are seen in conditions such as emphysema. The deep sulcus sign is seen in pneumothorax, not pleural effusion.",
"A 58-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of sudden-onset right-sided body numbness for 1 hour. He reports that he has a 15-year history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. Neurological examination shows decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body. Motor strength is 5/5 and deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Perfusion of which of the following structures of the brain is most likely impaired in this patient?
Options:
(A): Parietal lobe
(B): Posterior limb of the internal capsule
(C): Lateral medulla
(D): Basal pons
(E): Ventral thalamus
",Ventral thalamus,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Ventral thalamus.

Explanation:
The patient's sudden-onset right-sided body numbness and decreased sensation to light pinprick and temperature on the right side of the face and body suggest a lesion in the sensory pathway. The sensory pathway involves the transmission of sensory information from the periphery to the brain. The ventral thalamus is a relay station for sensory information, receiving input from various sensory pathways and transmitting it to the cerebral cortex for further processing.

In this patient, the impaired sensation on the right side of the face and body indicates a lesion in the sensory pathway that involves the ventral thalamus. The other options, such as the parietal lobe, posterior limb of the internal capsule, lateral medulla, and basal pons, are not directly involved in the relay of sensory information and would not explain the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the most likely site of impaired perfusion in this patient is the ventral thalamus.",
"A 9-year-old boy is brought in by his mother because of bruising on his torso and limbs. The patient’s mother denies any other symptoms and says he is otherwise healthy. Physical examination shows multiple petechiae and bruising on the torso and extremities bilaterally. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A complete blood count is normal. His coagulation profile reveals:
Prothrombin time (PT) 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 60 sec
Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(B): Hemophilia B
(C): Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
(D): Von Willebrand disease
(E): Hemophilia A
",Von Willebrand disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Von Willebrand disease.

Explanation:
Von Willebrand disease is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on the clinical presentation and coagulation profile. Von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (vWF), a protein involved in platelet adhesion and clot formation. It is the most common inherited bleeding disorder.

The patient's presentation of bruising and petechiae suggests a bleeding disorder. The normal complete blood count rules out a platelet disorder, making immune thrombocytopenic purpura (C) less likely. The prolonged aPTT suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, which is consistent with von Willebrand disease. Hemophilia A (E) and Hemophilia B (B) are both disorders of the coagulation cascade, but they would typically present with a prolonged PT and a normal aPTT. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A) is a type of cancer that can cause bruising and bleeding, but it would typically be associated with abnormal findings on the complete blood count.",
"A 31-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-week history of a painless lump near the left wrist and tingling pain over his left hand. Physical examination shows a transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, non-tender mass over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist. There is decreased sensation to pinprick on the thumb, index finger, middle finger, and radial half of the ring finger of the left hand. The tingling pain is aggravated by tapping over the swelling. Which of the following adjacent structures is at risk of entrapment if this mass persists?
Options:
(A): Ulnar artery
(B): Extensor pollicis brevis tendon
(C): Flexor pollicis longus tendon
(D): Flexor carpi radialis tendon
(E): Ulnar nerve
",Flexor pollicis longus tendon,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Flexor pollicis longus tendon.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the patient has a painless lump near the left wrist, which is transilluminating, rubbery, fixed, and non-tender. There is also tingling pain over the left hand. These findings are consistent with a ganglion cyst, which is a common soft cystic swelling that develops at the dorsum or volar aspect of the wrist.

The adjacent structure at risk of entrapment if this mass persists is the Flexor pollicis longus tendon. The flexor pollicis longus tendon runs parallel and ulnar to the flexor carpi radialis tendon. The median nerve travels below the depression between the palmaris longus and the flexor carpi radialis tendons. In this case, the ganglion cyst is located over the lateral volar aspect of the left wrist, which is in close proximity to the flexor pollicis longus tendon. The tingling pain aggravated by tapping over the swelling suggests compression of the adjacent structures, including the median nerve.

Therefore, the Flexor pollicis longus tendon is at risk of entrapment if this ganglion cyst persists.",
"A 52-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of a painless right-sided scrotal swelling. The swelling started several weeks ago but is not always present. Physical examination shows an 8-cm, soft, cystic nontender right-sided scrotal mass that transilluminates. The mass does not increase in size on coughing and it is possible to palpate normal tissue above the mass. There are no bowel sounds in the mass, and it does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. Examination of the testis shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the mass?
Options:
(A): Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis
(B): Failure of processus vaginalis to obliterate
(C): Extension of abdominal contents through the inguinal canal
(D): Dilation and tortuosity of veins in the pampiniform plexus
(E): Primary germ cell neoplasia of the testicle
",Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by tunica vaginalis.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the most likely cause of the painless scrotal swelling is an imbalance of fluid secretion and resorption by the tunica vaginalis. This is consistent with a hydrocele, which is a collection of fluid within the tunica vaginalis, the serous membrane that covers the testis. A hydrocele typically presents as a soft, cystic, nontender scrotal mass that transilluminates. It does not increase in size with coughing and does not reduce when the patient is in a supine position. The ability to palpate normal tissue above the mass suggests that the hydrocele is separate from the testis. Examination of the testis showing no abnormalities further supports the diagnosis of a hydrocele.",
"A 40-year-old patient is brought into the emergency department after suffering a motor vehicle crash where he was pinned underneath his motorcycle for about 30 minutes before a passerby called 911. While evaluating him per your institution's trauma guidelines, you discover pain upon palpation of his right lower extremity which is much larger than his left counterpart. The patient admits to decreased sensation over his right lower extremity and cannot move his leg. There are no palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses on this extremity, and it is colder and paler in comparison to his left side. Measured compartment pressure of his distal right leg is 35 mm Hg. What is the next best step in this patient's care?
Options:
(A): Emergent fasciotomy
(B): Venous doppler
(C): Arteriogram
(D): External fixation
(E): Internal fixation
",Emergent fasciotomy,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Emergent fasciotomy.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with acute compartment syndrome. Acute compartment syndrome occurs when there is increased pressure within a closed fascial compartment, leading to compromised blood flow and tissue ischemia. The classic signs and symptoms include severe pain, swelling, decreased sensation, and loss of motor function.

In this case, the patient has pain upon palpation, a significantly larger right lower extremity compared to the left, decreased sensation, and inability to move the leg. Additionally, there are no palpable pulses, and the affected extremity is colder and paler. These findings suggest compromised blood flow to the right lower extremity.

The measured compartment pressure of 35 mm Hg is also indicative of compartment syndrome. Normal compartment pressure is typically less than 10-15 mm Hg. A pressure of 30 mm Hg or higher is considered diagnostic of compartment syndrome and requires emergent intervention.

The next best step in this patient's care is emergent fasciotomy. Fasciotomy involves making incisions in the affected compartment's fascia to relieve the pressure and restore blood flow. This procedure is necessary to prevent irreversible tissue damage and potential limb loss.

Venous doppler (B) is not the next best step in this patient's care because the absence of pulses and the clinical presentation suggest arterial compromise rather than venous issues.

Arteriogram (C) may be useful in evaluating arterial flow, but it is not the next best step in this patient's care. The clinical presentation and compartment pressure measurement already strongly suggest compartment syndrome, and emergent fasciotomy is the appropriate intervention.

External fixation (D) and internal fixation (E) are not indicated at this time. The priority is to address the acute compartment syndrome and restore blood flow to the affected extremity. Fixation procedures may be considered later once the patient's condition stabilizes.",
"An 18-month-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of fever and a pruritic rash that started on his trunk and then progressed to his face and extremities. He has not received any childhood vaccinations because his parents believe that they are dangerous. His temperature is 38.0°C (100.4°F). A photograph of the rash is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Nonbullous impetigo
(B): Varicella
(C): Herpes zoster
(D): Rubella
(E): Erythema infectiosum
",Varicella,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Varicella.

Explanation:
The presentation of a fever and pruritic rash that starts on the trunk and progresses to the face and extremities is highly suggestive of varicella, also known as chickenpox. Varicella is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It is characterized by a rash that begins as small, red, itchy bumps that quickly progress to fluid-filled blisters. The rash typically starts on the trunk and then spreads to the face, scalp, and extremities. 

The fact that the child has not received any childhood vaccinations further supports the diagnosis of varicella. Vaccination against varicella is part of the routine childhood immunization schedule and has greatly reduced the incidence of the disease. However, in unvaccinated individuals, varicella can still occur and tends to be more severe.

Nonbullous impetigo (option A) is a bacterial skin infection characterized by honey-colored crusts and small, red bumps. It is not associated with fever or a widespread rash.

Herpes zoster (option C) is caused by reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus and typically presents as a painful, unilateral rash in a dermatomal distribution. It is uncommon in children and is usually seen in older individuals or those with compromised immune systems.

Rubella (option D) is a viral infection characterized by a rash that starts on the face and spreads to the trunk and extremities. It is typically a milder illness compared to varicella and is associated with lymphadenopathy and low-grade fever.

Erythema infectiosum (option E), also known as fifth disease, is a viral infection caused by parvovirus B19. It is characterized by a ""slapped cheek"" rash on the face and a lacy rash on the trunk and extremities. It is not associated with fever or a widespread rash.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis in this case is varicella (chickenpox) due to the characteristic presentation of fever and pruritic rash that starts on the trunk and progresses to the face and extremities.",
"A 43-year-old male is brought to the emergency department after his son found him vomiting bright red blood. He is visibly intoxicated, and hospital records indicate a long history of alcohol substance abuse treated with antabuse (disulfiram). Vital signs include T 98.4, HR 89, BP 154/92, and RR 20. EGD is notable for mild esophagitis, and a longitudinal esophageal tear at the gastroesophageal junction, with no active bleeding. What is the next best course of action?
Options:
(A): Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding, IV fluid hydration, and NPO
(B): Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation
(C): Barium swallow to characterize the depth of mucosal involvement
(D): Esophageal manometry and impedance studies
(E): Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter
",Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with vomiting bright red blood, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient's vital signs are stable, and there is no active bleeding seen on EGD. Given the patient's history of alcohol substance abuse and the presence of esophagitis and a longitudinal esophageal tear, the most appropriate next step is conservative management with IV fluid hydration and observation.

Cyanoacrylate injection and ligation with banding (option A) is typically used for the treatment of esophageal varices, not for esophageal tears. In this case, there is no active bleeding, so this intervention is not necessary.

Barium swallow (option C) is not indicated in the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It is used to evaluate the esophagus for structural abnormalities, such as strictures or tumors, but it does not provide information about the depth of mucosal involvement or guide immediate management.

Esophageal manometry and impedance studies (option D) are not necessary in the acute management of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These tests are used to evaluate esophageal motility disorders and gastroesophageal reflux disease, but they do not play a role in the immediate management of bleeding.

Calcium channel blockage and Botox injection of the lower esophageal sphincter (option E) are not indicated in the management of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. These interventions are used for the treatment of achalasia, a motility disorder of the esophagus, and are not relevant in this scenario.",
"A medical student is preparing a patient for an appendectomy. He is asked by the surgeon to disinfect the patient’s skin with a chlorhexidine-isopropyl alcohol solution before the procedure. Recent studies have shown that this solution substantially reduces the risk of surgical site infections compared with a povidone-iodine preparation without alcohol in clean-contaminated surgery. Which of the following mechanisms best describes the mechanism of action of chlorhexidine?
Options:
(A): Bactericidal at low concentrations
(B): Protein coagulation/denaturation
(C): Cell wall damage by free radical release
(D): Attack of free-sulfur amino acids, nucleotides, and fatty acids within the bacteria
(E): Its activity depends on pH and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter
",Its activity depends on pH and is greatly reduced in the presence of organic matter,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B): Protein coagulation/denaturation.

Explanation:
Chlorhexidine has activity against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, facultative anaerobes, aerobes, and yeast. It is both bacteriostatic and bactericidal, depending on its concentration. The bactericidal effect of chlorhexidine is a result of the binding of this cationic molecule to negatively charged bacterial cell walls and extramicrobial complexes. At low concentrations, this causes an alteration of bacterial cell osmotic equilibrium and leakage of potassium and phosphorous resulting in a bacteriostatic effect. At high concentrations of chlorhexidine, the cytoplasmic contents of the bacterial cell precipitate and result in cell death. This mechanism of action involves protein coagulation and denaturation, leading to cell death.",
"A 19-year-old man with a past medical history significant only for facial acne presents with increased inguinal pruritis. Relevant social history includes participation in school wrestling. He has no significant family history. Other than the pruritic rash, a review of systems is negative. On physical examination, there is an erythematous, well-demarcated patch on his left thigh, over his pubic region, and throughout the perineum. The scrotum is spared. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Tinea corporis
(B): Tinea cruris
(C): Candidal balanitis
(D): Pityriasis rosea
(E): Tinea unguium
",Tinea cruris,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Tinea cruris.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of increased inguinal pruritis, erythematous well-demarcated patches in the groin area, and involvement of the perineum while sparing the scrotum, the most likely diagnosis is tinea cruris.

Tinea cruris, also known as jock itch, is a superficial dermatophyte fungal infection that commonly affects the groin area. It is characterized by erythematous patches or plaques with peripheral scale. The infection can extend to the lower abdomen, proximal thighs, and buttocks. The pruritus is usually mild, and there may be concomitant tinea pedis (athlete's foot) or onychomycosis (fungal infection of the nails).

In this case, the patient's history of participation in school wrestling increases the risk of acquiring tinea cruris, as it is commonly transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces.

To confirm the diagnosis, a potassium hydroxide preparation of the scale can be performed, which will reveal large, branching hyphae, characteristic of dermatophyte infections.

Tinea corporis (option A) refers to a dermatophyte infection of the body, typically presenting as circular or oval erythematous patches with central clearing and an active, scaly border. This condition does not involve the groin area.

Candidal balanitis (option C) is a fungal infection that affects the glans penis in males. It typically presents as erythema, edema, and white, curd-like discharge. This condition does not involve the groin area.

Pityriasis rosea (option D) is a self-limited skin condition characterized by oval-shaped, pink or salmon-colored patches with a fine scale. It usually starts with a single ""herald patch"" followed by the appearance of multiple patches in a ""Christmas tree"" distribution. This condition does not typically involve the groin area.

Tinea unguium (option E) refers to a fungal infection of the nails. It presents with thickened, discolored nails that may be brittle or crumbly. This condition does not involve the groin area.",
"A 6-week-old girl is brought to the pediatrician for a post-natal visit. She was born at 38 weeks gestation to a 25-year-old woman via an uncomplicated spontaneous vaginal delivery. The mother reports that prenatal screening revealed no developmental abnormalities and that the baby has been gaining weight, feeding, stooling, and urinating appropriately. Physical exam of the infant is unremarkable. The mother has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and is curious about the development of her daughter's ovaries. Which of the following is true regarding the baby’s reproductive system at this time?
Options:
(A): The baby has not yet developed oocytes
(B): The baby’s oocytes are arrested in prophase
(C): The baby’s oocytes are arrested in metaphase
(D): The baby’s oocytes are arrested in interphase
(E): The baby’s oocytes are fully matured
",The baby’s oocytes are arrested in prophase,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): The baby’s oocytes are arrested in prophase.

Explanation:
At 6 weeks of age, the baby's reproductive system is still in the early stages of development. In female fetuses, the development of oocytes (egg cells) begins during fetal life. Oogonia, which are the precursor cells of oocytes, migrate from the yolk sac into the undifferentiated genital ridge and differentiate into primary oocytes.

During the 3rd month of gestation, some of these oogonia begin meiosis, a process of cell division that results in the formation of haploid cells (cells with half the number of chromosomes). However, the oocytes arrest in the prophase of meiosis I and remain in this stage until puberty.

This arrest in prophase is known as the diplotene stage and is a characteristic feature of oocyte development. It allows the oocytes to remain in a dormant state until they are needed for ovulation. At this stage, the oocytes are surrounded by a layer of granulosa cells, forming primordial follicles.

Therefore, at 6 weeks of age, the baby's oocytes are arrested in prophase and have not yet fully matured.",
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-week history of burning sensation in his mouth. One year ago, a peripheral blood smear performed during workup of fatigue revealed erythrocytes without central pallor. His father had gallstones, for which he underwent a cholecystectomy at the age of 26 years. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes, mild scleral icterus, a swollen, red tongue, and several mouth ulcers. There is darkening of the skin over the dorsal surfaces of the fingers, toes, and creases of the palms and soles. His spleen is enlarged and palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 9.1 gm/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 104 μm3, and a reticulocyte count of 9%. Which of the following would most likely have prevented this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms?
Options:
(A): Pneumococcal vaccine and antibiotic prophylaxis
(B): Red blood cell transfusions
(C): Gluten-free diet
(D): Vitamin B12 injections
(E): Folic acid supplementation
",Folic acid supplementation,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Folic acid supplementation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including burning sensation in the mouth, pallor of the mucosal membranes, swollen red tongue, and mouth ulcers, are consistent with megaloblastic anemia. Megaloblastic anemia is most commonly caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate. In this case, the patient's symptoms are likely due to a folate deficiency.

Folate is an essential nutrient that is necessary for the production of red blood cells. It is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables, citrus fruits, and legumes. A deficiency in folate can lead to impaired red blood cell production and the development of megaloblastic anemia.

Folic acid supplementation is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's oropharyngeal symptoms. By providing the patient with an adequate amount of folate, the body will be able to produce healthy red blood cells, which can help alleviate the symptoms of megaloblastic anemia, including the burning sensation in the mouth.

The other options listed are not appropriate for this patient's condition. Pneumococcal vaccine and antibiotic prophylaxis (option A) are used to prevent infections, but they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Red blood cell transfusions (option B) may be necessary in severe cases of anemia, but they do not address the underlying deficiency. A gluten-free diet (option C) is used to manage celiac disease, which is not the cause of the patient's symptoms. Vitamin B12 injections (option D) would be appropriate if the patient had a vitamin B12 deficiency, but the symptoms described are more consistent with a folate deficiency.",
"An experimental new drug in the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 was found to increase the levels of incretins by preventing their degradation at the endothelium. This further increased glucose-dependent insulin production. Which of the following drugs has a mechanism of action most similar to this new experimental drug?
Options:
(A): Exenatide
(B): Sitagliptin
(C): Glimepiride
(D): Canagliflozin
(E): Pioglitazone
",Sitagliptin,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Sitagliptin.

Explanation:
Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which inhibits the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) that inactivates incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP. By blocking the actions of DPP-4, sitagliptin prolongs the effects of incretins, leading to increased insulin secretion and improved control of blood glucose levels. This mechanism of action is similar to the experimental drug described in the question, which also prevents the degradation of incretins and increases glucose-dependent insulin production. 

Exenatide (choice A) is a GLP-1 receptor agonist, which mimics the action of GLP-1 and stimulates insulin secretion. While it also increases incretin levels, its mechanism of action is different from the experimental drug.

Glimepiride (choice C) is a sulfonylurea, which works by stimulating insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. It does not affect incretin levels or prevent their degradation.

Canagliflozin (choice D) is an SGLT2 inhibitor, which works by inhibiting the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, leading to increased urinary glucose excretion. It does not affect incretin levels or prevent their degradation.

Pioglitazone (choice E) is a thiazolidinedione, which improves insulin sensitivity in target cells. It does not affect incretin levels or prevent their degradation.",
"A 60-year-old man with severe persistent asthma since the age of 14 presents with an acute exacerbation of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing over the last several days. His asthmatic symptoms are usually well controlled with regular high-dose inhaled triamcinolone, but over the last week or so he has developed a nocturnal cough and mild wheezing despite good compliance with controller medications. A review of several spirometry reports suggest of bronchial asthma with a partial irreversible airway obstruction. Which of the following is most likely to be associated with the recent loss of asthma control in this patient?
Options:
(A): Airway epithelial shedding
(B): Airway smooth muscle atrophy
(C): Airway remodeling
(D): Airway inflammation
(E): Airway hyperresponsiveness
",Airway remodeling,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Airway remodeling.

Explanation:
Airway remodeling refers to the structural changes that occur in the airways of individuals with asthma over time. These changes can include thickening of the airway walls, increased smooth muscle mass, and increased deposition of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. 

In this patient, the spirometry reports suggest a partial irreversible airway obstruction, which is a characteristic feature of airway remodeling. The recent loss of asthma control, as evidenced by the acute exacerbation of symptoms despite good compliance with controller medications, is likely due to the progression of airway remodeling. 

Airway epithelial shedding (A) can occur in asthma, but it is not the primary cause of the recent loss of asthma control in this patient. Airway smooth muscle atrophy (B) is not typically seen in asthma and would not explain the symptoms and spirometry findings in this patient. Airway inflammation (D) and airway hyperresponsiveness (E) are both features of asthma, but they are not the primary cause of the recent loss of asthma control in this patient.",
"A 75-year-old man is admitted to the hospital because of a 3-day history of a productive cough and shortness of breath. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F) and respirations are 32/min. Crackles are heard over the right upper and the entire left lung fields. Sputum culture confirms infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Despite appropriate therapy, the patient dies. A photomicrograph of a section of the lung obtained during the autopsy is shown. Which of the following mediators is most likely responsible for the presence of the cell-type indicated by the arrow?
Options:
(A): Immunoglobulin E
(B): Platelet activating factor
(C): Interferon-gamma
(D): Interleukin-10
(E): Leukotriene D4
",Platelet activating factor,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Platelet activating factor.

Explanation:
The photomicrograph shows the presence of neutrophils, which are indicated by the arrow. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in the immune response to infection. In this case, the patient has a bacterial infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Platelet activating factor (PAF) is a mediator that is released during the inflammatory response. It is produced by various cells, including neutrophils, and plays a role in the recruitment and activation of neutrophils at the site of infection. PAF can cause the release of other inflammatory mediators, such as leukotrienes, and can also increase vascular permeability, leading to the accumulation of fluid and cells in the lungs.

In this case, the presence of neutrophils in the lung tissue suggests an inflammatory response to the bacterial infection. PAF is likely responsible for the recruitment and activation of these neutrophils, leading to the observed inflammation and lung damage.",
"A 2-month-old infant is brought to the emergency department by her mother due to a fall. Tearfully, the patient’s mother describes witnessing her child fall from the changing table. The patient was born prematurely at 36 weeks estimated gestational age via vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery. The patient is afebrile. Her vital signs include: blood pressure of 94/60 mm Hg, pulse 200/min, and respiratory rate 70/min. Physical examination reveals a subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye and multiple bruises on the chest and back. Which of the following is the best initial step in management of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): CT scan of the head
(B): Involvement of social services
(C): Informing the police
(D): Family counseling
(E): Rule out medical conditions
",CT scan of the head,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) CT scan of the head.

Explanation:
Given the history of a fall from the changing table and the presence of multiple bruises, it is important to evaluate for any potential head injury in this 2-month-old infant. The high pulse rate of 200/min and subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye are concerning for possible head trauma. A CT scan of the head is the best initial step in management to assess for any intracranial injury or bleeding. This will help determine the extent of the injury and guide further management. It is important to rule out any serious underlying medical conditions before considering other options such as involvement of social services or family counseling. Informing the police may be necessary if child abuse is suspected, but the initial focus should be on the medical evaluation and management of the patient.",
"A researcher is interested in identifying the most effective treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI) in women between the ages of 18 and 50. Of 200 consecutive women who present to the emergency room for such a UTI, 50 are randomized to each of the following: nitrofurantoin 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days, nitrofurantoin 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days, cefpodoxime 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days, and cefpodoxime 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days. The measured outcomes include progression to pyelonephritis, positive urine culture on day 7 after initiation of treatment, and likelihood of re-presenting to the emergency room for another UTI within 90 days. Which of the following best describes this type of study?
Options:
(A): Parallel study
(B): Factorial design study
(C): Non-crossover study
(D): Between patient study
(E): Cluster randomized trial
",Factorial design study,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Factorial design study.

Explanation:
A factorial design study is a type of clinical trial where multiple interventions or treatments are tested simultaneously. In this study, the researcher is comparing four different treatment options for uncomplicated UTIs in women. Each treatment option (nitrofurantoin 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days, nitrofurantoin 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days, cefpodoxime 100 mg every 12 hours for 5 days, and cefpodoxime 100 mg every 12 hours for 7 days) is being tested independently, and the outcomes are measured for each treatment group. This allows for the evaluation of the effectiveness of each treatment option and the comparison of different treatment durations and antibiotics.",
"A 31-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of acute onset neck pain and enlargement. Specifically, he reports that he has been experiencing pain and swelling of the anterior portion of his neck near the midline. Otherwise, he says that he has been getting tired easily and feels cold often. Physical exam reveals a painful diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules. A biopsy is obtained showing diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia. Given these findings, the patient is started on appropriate therapy, and the neck mass becomes smaller over time. Which of the following is most likely associated with the cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): HLA-B8 risk factor
(B): Increased 131-iodine uptake
(C): Iodine deficiency
(D): Presence of embryological remnant
(E): Proliferation of fibroinflammatory cells
",Iodine deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Iodine deficiency.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of acute onset neck pain and enlargement, along with tiredness and feeling cold often, and the physical exam findings of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland with many small nodules, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is iodine deficiency.

Iodine is an essential component of thyroid hormones, and a deficiency in iodine can lead to the development of a goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid gland. In iodine deficiency, the thyroid gland tries to compensate by increasing its size and producing more thyroid hormone, resulting in the formation of multiple small nodules.

The biopsy findings of diffuse cellular hyperplasia with areas of focal colloid hyperplasia further support the diagnosis of iodine deficiency. Diffuse cellular hyperplasia refers to an increase in the number of thyroid cells, while focal colloid hyperplasia refers to the accumulation of colloid, which is the substance that stores thyroid hormone.

Appropriate therapy for iodine deficiency includes the administration of iodine supplements or increasing dietary intake of iodine-rich foods. With treatment, the neck mass typically becomes smaller over time as the thyroid gland returns to its normal size and function.",
"A 25-year-old man presents to the office because of extreme fatigue for the past 2 days. He is also worried about his skin looking yellow. He does not have any other complaints and denies fever and headache. He admits to using illicit intravenous drugs in the past. He does not have any immunization records because he moved from Africa to the US at the age of 18. His vital signs are as follows: heart rate 72/min, respiratory rate 14/min, temperature 37.9°C (100.2°F), and blood pressure 100/74 mm Hg. Physical examination is not significant except for mild diffuse abdominal tenderness. His blood is drawn for routine tests and shows an alanine aminotransferase level (ALT) of 2,000 IU/L. A hepatitis viral panel is ordered which shows:
Anti-HAV IgM negative
HBsAg positive
Anti-HBs negative
IgM anti-HBc positive
Anti-HCV negative
Anti-HDV negative
What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Past hepatitis B infection
(B): Chronic hepatitis B
(C): Acute hepatitis A
(D): Acute hepatitis D superinfection
(E): Acute hepatitis B
",Acute hepatitis B,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Acute hepatitis B.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute hepatitis B infection. The key findings that support this diagnosis are:
- HBsAg positive: This indicates active infection with the hepatitis B virus.
- IgM anti-HBc positive: This indicates recent infection with the hepatitis B virus.
- Anti-HAV IgM negative: This rules out acute hepatitis A infection.
- Anti-HBs negative: This indicates that the patient does not have protective antibodies against hepatitis B.
- Anti-HCV negative: This rules out hepatitis C infection.
- Anti-HDV negative: This rules out acute hepatitis D superinfection.

The patient's symptoms of extreme fatigue and yellow skin (jaundice) are consistent with hepatitis B infection. The elevated ALT level of 2,000 IU/L indicates liver inflammation and damage, which is commonly seen in acute hepatitis B.

The patient's history of illicit intravenous drug use and lack of immunization records suggest potential risk factors for hepatitis B infection. Acute hepatitis B can be transmitted through exposure to infected blood or body fluids, such as through sharing needles or having unprotected sex.

Chronic hepatitis B is characterized by persistent infection with the hepatitis B virus for more than 6 months. The patient's presentation is more consistent with acute infection rather than chronic infection.

Past hepatitis B infection would be indicated by the presence of anti-HBs antibodies, which are protective antibodies that develop after recovery from acute infection or after vaccination. Since the patient is negative for anti-HBs, past infection is less likely.

Acute hepatitis A is ruled out by the negative anti-HAV IgM result.

Acute hepatitis D superinfection is ruled out by the negative anti-HDV result.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is acute hepatitis B.",
"A 29-year-old female presents to her primary care provider with an aching pain in her left leg that has progressively gotten worse over several days. She recently had an unfortunate sporting incident resulting in large bruises along both legs and lower thighs. An X-ray after the event was negative for fracture. Past medical history is positive for systemic lupus erythematosus. She also has a history of one spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks gestation. Today, her heart rate is 90/min, respiratory rate is 17/min, blood pressure is 119/80 mm Hg, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her left leg appears pink and slightly swollen. Homan’s sign is positive. A Doppler ultrasound reveals a thrombus in the left popliteal vein. Her lab results are as follows:
Platelets 250,000/mm3
Prothrombin Time 14 sec
Partial Thromboplastin Time 90 sec
Mixing study (PTT) 89 sec
What is the most likely cause of the patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
(B): Antibodies directed against phospholipids
(C): Antibodies directed against endothelial cells
(D): Vitamin K deficiency
(E): Disseminated intravascular coagulation
",Antibodies directed against phospholipids,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Antibodies directed against phospholipids.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is characterized by pain, swelling, and redness in the affected limb. The positive Homan's sign and the presence of a thrombus on Doppler ultrasound further support the diagnosis of DVT.

The patient's medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is significant because it is associated with an increased risk of developing antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). APS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antibodies directed against phospholipids, specifically cardiolipin and beta-2 glycoprotein I. These antibodies can lead to hypercoagulability and an increased risk of thrombosis.

The lab results in this patient are also consistent with APS. The prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and the mixing study result suggest the presence of an inhibitor, which is commonly seen in APS. The platelet count is within the normal range, ruling out antibodies directed against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa as the cause.

Vitamin K deficiency (choice D) is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's condition as it typically presents with bleeding manifestations rather than thrombosis. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (choice E) is also unlikely as the patient's lab results do not show evidence of widespread activation of the coagulation cascade.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is antibodies directed against phospholipids, specifically in the context of antiphospholipid syndrome associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.",
"A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient?
Options:
(A): Isoniazid
(B): Fluconazole
(C): Caspofungin
(D): Prednisone
(E): Surgical resection of the infiltrates
",Prednisone,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Prednisone.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus, a common environmental fungus. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, coughing, and sputum production, as well as infiltrates on chest radiograph and elevated serum IgE levels.

The patient's symptoms of worsening shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and greenish sputum with specks of red are consistent with ABPA. The presence of fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs further supports this diagnosis. The physical exam findings of inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes are also consistent with ABPA.

The most appropriate therapy for ABPA is systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Prednisone helps to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response, which can alleviate symptoms and prevent further lung damage. The recommended initial dose of prednisone for acute attacks of ABPA is 30-40 mg per day, with a maintenance dose of 5-10 mg per day. In some cases, itraconazole, an antifungal medication, may be used in combination with corticosteroids.

The other options listed are not appropriate for the treatment of ABPA. Isoniazid is used to treat tuberculosis, which is not the likely diagnosis in this patient. Fluconazole and caspofungin are antifungal medications, but they are not the first-line treatment for ABPA. Surgical resection of the infiltrates is not indicated in ABPA, as it is a systemic condition that affects multiple areas of the lungs.",
"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm³, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm³), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?
Options:
(A): Staphylococcus aureus
(B): Streptococcus pyogene
(C): Streptococcus pneumoniae
(D): Neisseria meningitidis
(E): Non-typeable H. influenzae
",Streptococcus pneumoniae,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely organism causing the patient's symptoms is Streptococcus pneumoniae. 

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococcus that commonly causes pneumonia, especially in individuals with underlying risk factors such as recent surgery or immunocompromised states. The patient in this case had a history of surgery after a motor vehicle accident, which could have predisposed him to a pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The patient's symptoms of fever, dyspnea, and cyanosis, along with the chest X-ray findings of interstitial infiltrates, are consistent with pneumonia. The leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and coagulation abnormalities suggest disseminated coagulation, which can occur in severe cases of pneumococcal pneumonia.

Gram staining of the autopsy specimen revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains, which is characteristic of Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are also gram-positive organisms that can cause pneumonia, but they are less likely in this case based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.

Neisseria meningitidis is a gram-negative diplococcus that can cause meningitis, but there are no signs of meningeal infection in this patient.

Non-typeable H. influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus that can cause respiratory tract infections, but it is less likely in this case based on the gram stain findings and the absence of typical symptoms associated with H. influenzae infections.",
"A 12-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department 3 hours after the sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. The patient also manifests symptoms of redness and swelling of the face and lips without pruritus. Her symptoms began following a tooth extraction earlier in the morning. She had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident 1 year ago, which resolved within 48 hours without treatment. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and an enlarged tongue. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants. An abdominal ultrasound shows segmental thickening of the intestinal wall. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Autoantibody-mediated tissue damage
(B): Complement inhibitor deficiency
(C): Drug-induced bradykinin excess
(D): Leukotriene overproduction
(E): Mast-cell activation
",Complement inhibitor deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Complement inhibitor deficiency.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the patient's symptoms are consistent with hereditary angioedema (HAE) due to complement inhibitor deficiency. HAE is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling in various parts of the body, including the face, lips, tongue, extremities, and abdomen. These episodes are often triggered by local trauma or infection, as seen in this case with the tooth extraction. The absence of pruritus and urticaria distinguishes HAE from allergic reactions. 

The patient's symptoms of colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and segmental thickening of the intestinal wall on ultrasound are indicative of abdominal angioedema, which can mimic a surgical emergency. The tenderness to palpation over the lower quadrants further supports this diagnosis. 

The nontender facial edema, erythema of the oral mucosa, and enlarged tongue are consistent with the clinical presentation of HAE. The episodes typically worsen over 12 to 24 hours and resolve within 72 hours. 

Diagnosis of HAE hinges on the clinical presentation, positive family history, and low levels of C4 and C1 inhibitor. In this case, the patient had a similar episode of facial swelling after a bicycle accident, which further supports the diagnosis of HAE. 

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is complement inhibitor deficiency, making choice (B) the correct answer.",
"A healthy 21-year-old man undergoes physical fitness testing prior to long-term submarine deployment. To evaluate his pulmonary function, lung and thoracic compliance are measured at different system pressures. A graph of the relationship between his lung volume and transpulmonary pressure is shown. The dotted line in this graph corresponds to which of the following lung volumes?
Options:
(A): Inspiratory capacity
(B): Vital capacity
(C): Tidal volume
(D): Functional residual capacity
(E): Total lung capacity
",Functional residual capacity,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Functional residual capacity.

Explanation:
The graph shows the relationship between lung volume and transpulmonary pressure. The dotted line corresponds to the lung volume at which the transpulmonary pressure is zero. This is known as the functional residual capacity (FRC). FRC is the volume of air that remains in the lungs after a normal expiration, when the elastic recoil of the lungs is balanced by the outward recoil of the chest wall. It represents the equilibrium point between the tendency of the lungs to collapse and the tendency of the chest wall to expand. FRC is an important measurement in assessing lung function and is often used to diagnose and monitor lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma.",
"A 3-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 4-hour history of somnolence, poor feeding, and one episode of vomiting. He is exclusively breastfed. His serum glucose concentration is 88 mg/dL and his serum ammonia concentration is 850 μmol/L (N<90). Urinalysis shows an increased orotic acid to creatinine ratio. Urinary ketones are absent. This patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes which of the following reactions?
Options:
(A): Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline
(B): Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate
(C): Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A
(D): Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate
(E): Arginine to urea and ornithine
",Ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B): Orotic acid to uridine monophosphate.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this patient is most likely deficient in an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of orotic acid to uridine monophosphate (UMP). This is consistent with a diagnosis of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC deficiency), which is an X-linked disorder that affects the urea cycle.

In OTC deficiency, there is a deficiency of the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase, which is responsible for the conversion of ornithine and carbamoyl phosphate to citrulline. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of carbamoyl phosphate, which is then converted to orotic acid instead of citrulline. The increased orotic acid levels can be detected in the urine, as seen in this patient.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and laboratory findings:
(A): Hypoxanthine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate to inosine monophosphate - This is not related to the urea cycle and is not consistent with the laboratory findings.
(C): Pyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A - This is not related to the urea cycle and is not consistent with the laboratory findings.
(D): Glutamate and acetyl-coenzyme A to N-acetylglutamate - This is not related to the urea cycle and is not consistent with the laboratory findings.
(E): Arginine to urea and ornithine - This is part of the urea cycle, but the laboratory findings do not support a deficiency in this enzyme.",
"A 31-year-old woman comes to the physician because of dragging pelvic pain and a 3 kg (6 lb 9 oz) weight loss over the past 6 months. Menses occur at irregular 30- to 45-day intervals; her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), heart rate is 102/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows hyperreflexia. Urine pregnancy test is negative. Ultrasonography shows a 6-cm hypoechoic adnexal mass. This adnexal mass is most likely derived from which of the following cell types?
Options:
(A): Ovarian epithelial cells
(B): Germ cells
(C): Chorionic epithelial cells
(D): Endometrial cells
(E): Stromal cells
",Germ cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Germ cells.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is an ovarian germ cell tumor. The patient's symptoms of pelvic pain, weight loss, and irregular menstrual periods, along with the physical examination findings of hyperreflexia, suggest a possible ovarian tumor. The ultrasonography findings of a hypoechoic adnexal mass further support this diagnosis.

Germ cell tumors are derived from the cells that give rise to eggs in the ovary. These tumors can be benign or malignant and are most commonly seen in young women. They can present with a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in menstrual patterns.

Ovarian epithelial cell tumors (choice A) are the most common type of ovarian tumors, but they typically present with different symptoms, such as abdominal distension and urinary symptoms. Chorionic epithelial cell tumors (choice C) are rare and usually associated with pregnancy. Endometrial cell tumors (choice D) are typically found within the uterus and not the ovary. Stromal cell tumors (choice E) are also rare and usually present with hormonal symptoms, such as abnormal bleeding or virilization.",
"A 55-year-old man comes to the emergency department with the complaint of pain in his right toe for the past hour. The pain is so severe that it woke him up. The patient has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for the last 40 years and binge drinks alcohol after work and on the weekends. He underwent an appendectomy when he was 14 years old. He is a long-distance truck driver. Neither of his parents had any significant medical history. His temperature is 37.7°C (100°F), blood pressure is 135/75 mm Hg, pulse is 102/min, respiratory rate is 20/min, and BMI is 25 kg/m2. On examination, his right first metatarsophalangeal joint is very tender, swollen, warm, and red in color. Range of motion cannot be assessed due to extreme tenderness.
Laboratory test
Complete blood count:
Hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL
Leukocytes 16,000/mm3
Platelets 150,000/mm3
ESR 50 mm/hr
Synovial fluid is aspirated from the joint. The findings are:
Appearance Cloudy, dense yellow
WBC 30,000 cells/µL
Culture Negative
Needle-shaped birefringent crystals are observed in the joint aspirate. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion
(B): Increased renal reabsorption of urate
(C): Lysis of large numbers of cells
(D): Deficiency of HGPRT
(E): High-purine diet
",Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Organic acids competing with urate for tubular secretion.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute gouty arthritis. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and tissues. It typically presents with sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the affected joint. The most common joint involved is the first metatarsophalangeal joint, which is the joint in the big toe.

The laboratory findings in this patient are also consistent with gout. The elevated white blood cell count and cloudy, dense yellow appearance of the synovial fluid indicate the presence of inflammation and infection. However, the negative culture suggests that the inflammation is not due to an infectious cause. The presence of needle-shaped birefringent crystals in the joint aspirate confirms the diagnosis of gout.

The underlying cause of gout is an elevated level of uric acid in the blood, which can occur due to either overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. In this patient, the most likely cause is underexcretion of uric acid. Organic acids, such as lactic acid and ketones, compete with urate for tubular secretion in the kidneys. This competition leads to decreased excretion of uric acid and increased levels in the blood, predisposing to the formation of urate crystals in the joints.

The other options are not the most likely underlying cause of the patient's condition:
- Increased renal reabsorption of urate (B) is not the most likely cause because it would result in decreased levels of uric acid in the blood, not increased levels.
- Lysis of large numbers of cells (C) is not the most likely cause because it would result in an increased production of uric acid, not decreased excretion.
- Deficiency of HGPRT (D) is not the most likely cause because it is associated with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which presents with neurologic and behavioral abnormalities in addition to gout.
- High-purine diet (E) can contribute to elevated uric acid levels, but it is not the most likely cause in this patient given his other risk factors such as alcohol consumption and smoking.",
"A 33-year-old man presents to the infectious diseases clinic for follow-up. He was recently admitted to the hospital with fever, shortness of breath, and cough, and was found to have Pneumocystic jirovecii pneumonia and a new diagnosis of HIV. His CD4 count is 175, viral load is pending. As part of routine laboratory studies given his new diagnosis, an RPR was found to be positive with a titer of 1:64, and this is confirmed with a positive FTA-ABS. He is unsure when or how he acquired HIV or syphilis. His neurological examination is normal, and he has no symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management:
Options:
(A): Perform lumbar puncture, treat based on presence or absence of CNS disease
(B): Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months
(C): Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months
(D): Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 3 months
(E): Treat with a single injection of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months
","Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months",Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Treat with three weekly injections of penicillin, obtain titers in 6 months.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a positive RPR with a titer of 1:64 and a positive FTA-ABS, indicating a diagnosis of syphilis. The next step in management should be to treat the patient with penicillin. The recommended treatment for syphilis in HIV-infected patients is three weekly injections of penicillin. This is based on the CDC guidelines, which recommend an aggressive diagnostic approach to HIV-infected patients with reactive RPR or VDRL tests of longer than 1-year (or unknown) duration. All such patients should have a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation. If the CSF evaluation is normal, the patient should be treated as having late latent syphilis with three weekly injections of penicillin. Follow-up titers should be obtained in 6 months to monitor treatment response.

Performing a lumbar puncture to determine the presence or absence of CNS disease is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no neurological symptoms and a normal neurological examination. Lumbar puncture is recommended for HIV-seropositive individuals with syphilis of any stage, particularly those with a serum RPR titer of ≥1:32 or a CD4+ T-cell count of ≤350/μL.

Treating with a single injection of penicillin and obtaining titers in 3 months is not the most appropriate next step, as the recommended treatment for syphilis in HIV-infected patients is three weekly injections of penicillin. Follow-up titers should be obtained in 6 months to monitor treatment response.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is to treat with three weekly injections of penicillin and obtain titers in 6 months.",
"A 67-year old man presents to his primary care physician for his yearly checkup. He has not noticed any major changes in his health over the last year but says that unfortunately, he stopped exercising because he has been stressed by work. His past medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia. He is taking a number of drugs but does not remember what they are. A panel of metabolic and lipid tests are ordered and show worsening of his metabolic parameters. Based on these findings, his physician prescribes a drug that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins and decrease in low-density lipoproteins. The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is associated with which of the following side effects?
Options:
(A): Acanthosis nigricans
(B): Cholelithiasis
(C): Decreased vitamin D absorption
(D): Hepatotoxicity
(E): Teratogenicity
",Cholelithiasis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Cholelithiasis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperlipidemia, it is likely that he has dyslipidemia. Dyslipidemia refers to abnormal levels of lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) in the blood. In this case, the patient's metabolic and lipid tests showed worsening of his metabolic parameters, indicating a need for treatment.

The drug that was most likely prescribed in this case is a medication that leads to a large decrease in triglycerides with a much smaller increase in high-density lipoproteins (HDL) and decrease in low-density lipoproteins (LDL). This suggests that the drug is specifically targeting triglyceride levels.

One of the side effects associated with medications used to treat dyslipidemia, particularly those that lower triglyceride levels, is cholelithiasis, or the formation of gallstones. Gallstones are solid deposits that form in the gallbladder, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

Therefore, the most likely side effect associated with the drug prescribed in this case is cholelithiasis. It is important for the patient to be aware of this potential side effect and to report any symptoms to his physician.",
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her OB/GYN for a preconception visit. She wishes to become pregnant within the next several months. A thorough history reveals that the patient suffers from phenylketonuria (PKU). She recalls being instructed by prior physicians to follow a diet that avoids certain foods; however, she admits to not being complaint with these recommendations. Laboratory testing reveals a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL (normal range <2 mg/dL). Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient?
Options:
(A): Even with appropriate treatment, your condition will prevent you from becoming pregnant
(B): Improved PKU treatment will decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death
(C): 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL
(D): Begin a phenylalanine-restricted diet in your first trimester to reduce the risk of fetal morbidity
(E): Your current phenylalanine levels do not pose a risk to any future pregnancy
","3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL",Correct,"The correct choice is (C): 3 months prior to conception, begin a restricted diet to lower phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL.

Explanation:
Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by the inability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. If left untreated, high levels of phenylalanine can lead to intellectual disability and other neurological complications. In pregnant women with PKU, high levels of phenylalanine can also cause fetal abnormalities.

In this case, the patient has a plasma phenylalanine level of 20.2 mg/dL, which is significantly higher than the normal range (<2 mg/dL). Therefore, it is important to address this issue before the patient conceives.

The most appropriate response is to advise the patient to begin a restricted diet to lower her phenylalanine levels to below 6 mg/dL at least 3 months prior to conception. This is based on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development statement, which recommends reducing plasma phenylalanine levels to <6 mg/dL before conception and maintaining levels between 2 to 6 mg/dL during pregnancy to prevent phenylalanine embryopathy.

Starting a phenylalanine-restricted diet in the first trimester (choice D) is not the most appropriate response because the patient should ideally lower her phenylalanine levels before conception to minimize the risk of fetal morbidity.

Choice A is incorrect because appropriate treatment, including a restricted diet, can allow women with PKU to have successful pregnancies.

Choice B is incorrect because while improved PKU treatment can decrease the risks of spontaneous abortion and intrauterine fetal death, the immediate concern in this case is to lower the patient's high phenylalanine levels before conception.

Choice E is incorrect because the patient's current phenylalanine levels are significantly elevated and pose a risk to any future pregnancy.",
"A 47-year-old man presents to his family physician with a sudden onset of severe pain and redness in his eyes that started this morning. He is having difficulty seeing properly and is extremely worried about losing his vision. Further history reveals that he has had progressive lower back pain for over 2 months now. The pain is usually at its worst in the morning, but it remains throughout the day. It gets better with movement, however, so he tends to do some light exercises every day. He also has heel pain and feels significant pressure while walking. Laboratory analysis reveals increased ESR and CRP serum levels. Which of the following would most likely be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Dry mouth
(B): Conjunctivitis
(C): Malabsorption
(D): Aortic regurgitation
(E): Hemochromatosis
",Aortic regurgitation,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Aortic regurgitation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the spine and sacroiliac joints. It is associated with the presence of HLA-B27 antigen. In addition to back pain, patients with ankylosing spondylitis can develop extra-articular manifestations, such as uveitis (inflammation of the eye), which presents with severe pain, redness, and visual disturbances. The increased ESR and CRP levels are indicative of ongoing inflammation.

Aortic regurgitation is a known complication of ankylosing spondylitis. Chronic inflammation in the aortic root can lead to fibrosis and calcification, resulting in aortic valve dysfunction. Aortic regurgitation can cause symptoms such as exertional dyspnea, palpitations, and angina. In severe cases, it can lead to heart failure.

Dry mouth (option A) is not typically associated with ankylosing spondylitis. It may be seen in conditions such as Sjogren's syndrome or as a side effect of certain medications.

Conjunctivitis (option B) is a common eye condition characterized by inflammation of the conjunctiva. While uveitis can present with redness and pain similar to conjunctivitis, the presence of severe pain, visual disturbances, and the association with ankylosing spondylitis make uveitis a more likely diagnosis in this case.

Malabsorption (option C) is not a typical feature of ankylosing spondylitis. It may be seen in conditions such as celiac disease or pancreatic insufficiency.

Hemochromatosis (option E) is a genetic disorder characterized by excessive iron absorption and deposition in various organs. It is not directly associated with ankylosing spondylitis.",
"A 38-year-old woman presents to her physician’s clinic for recurrent episodes of chest pain that wakes her from her sleep. While usually occurring late at night, she has also had similar pains during the day at random times, most recently while sitting at her desk in her office and at other times while doing the dishes at home. The pain lasts 10–15 minutes and resolves spontaneously. She is unable to identify any common preceding event to pain onset. The remainder of her history is unremarkable and she takes no regular medications. She works as an accountant. There is no history of smoking or drug use, however, she does consume 5 alcoholic drinks per week. Examination reveals: pulse 70/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg. A physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following would be effective in reducing her symptoms?
Options:
(A): Aspirin
(B): Digoxin
(C): Isosorbide dinitrate
(D): Heparin
(E): Propranolol
",Isosorbide dinitrate,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Isosorbide dinitrate.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of recurrent episodes of chest pain that wake her from sleep and occur at random times during the day, lasting 10-15 minutes and resolving spontaneously, the most likely diagnosis is angina pectoris. Angina pectoris is chest pain or discomfort that occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough blood and oxygen. It is typically caused by atherosclerosis, which is the narrowing of the coronary arteries due to the buildup of plaque.

Isosorbide dinitrate is a medication that belongs to the class of drugs known as nitrates. Nitrates work by dilating the blood vessels, including the coronary arteries, which increases blood flow to the heart muscle and relieves the symptoms of angina. Isosorbide dinitrate is commonly used to prevent and treat angina episodes.

Aspirin is commonly used in the management of cardiovascular conditions, but it is primarily used for its antiplatelet effects to prevent blood clot formation. It is not the first-line treatment for relieving the symptoms of angina.

Digoxin is a medication used to treat heart failure and certain arrhythmias. It does not have a direct role in relieving the symptoms of angina.

Heparin is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent and treat blood clots. It is not indicated for the relief of angina symptoms.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker medication that is commonly used in the management of angina. However, it is not the first-line treatment for relieving the symptoms of angina.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice for reducing the patient's symptoms of angina is isosorbide dinitrate.",
"A 16-year-old male presents to his pediatrician with complaints of malaise, fatigue, sore throat, and fever over the last several days. His vital signs are as follows: T 39.1 C, HR 82, BP 122/76, RR 14, and SpO2 99%. Physical examination is significant for splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy. The tonsils are not notably enlarged. Laboratory work-up shows an elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on a peripheral blood smear, and a positive heterophile antibody screen. Which of the following is the best management of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Bed rest and activity limitation
(B): Acyclovir
(C): Ganciclovir
(D): Amoxicillin
(E): Prednisone
",Bed rest and activity limitation,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bed rest and activity limitation.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms (malaise, fatigue, sore throat, and fever), physical examination findings (splenomegaly, tonsillar exudate, and posterior auricular lymphadenopathy), and laboratory results (elevated lymphocyte count, atypical lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear, and positive heterophile antibody screen), the most likely diagnosis is infectious mononucleosis, also known as ""mono"" or ""kissing disease.""

Infectious mononucleosis is typically caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is transmitted through saliva. The symptoms of mono can last for several weeks, and the mainstay of treatment is supportive care, including bed rest and activity limitation. This is important to allow the body to rest and recover, as well as to prevent complications such as splenic rupture, which can occur due to the enlargement of the spleen seen in mono.

Acyclovir and ganciclovir are antiviral medications that are used to treat certain viral infections, but they are not effective against EBV, the virus responsible for mono. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections, but it is not indicated for the treatment of viral infections like mono. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, may be used in some cases of severe mono with complications such as airway obstruction or hemolytic anemia, but it is not the first-line treatment for uncomplicated mono.

Therefore, the best management for this patient's condition is bed rest and activity limitation.",
"A 75-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of nausea and vomiting. Over the past 2 days, he has also been feeling weak and tired. When standing up after sitting for a while, he feels dizzy. He says he has to go to the bathroom more often than usual, and that he is urinating “a normal amount” each time. He has not had diarrhea. He has hypertension, for which he has been taking hydrochlorothiazide for the past 6 months. He drinks 9 glasses of water per day and takes his medication regularly. He is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), blood pressure is 106/54 mm Hg, and pulse is 92/min. Physical examination shows whitening of the tongue. Skin that is pinched on the back of the hand retracts after 5 seconds. On mental status examination, his speech is slowed; he is oriented to person, place, and time. Laboratory studies show:
Serum
Na+ 150 mEq/L
Cl− 97 mEq/L
K+ 3.6 mEq/L
HCO3− 30 mEq/L
Osmolality 354 mOsm/kg
Hemoglobin A1C 10.5%
Urine
Osmolality 400 mOsm/kg
Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
Options:
(A): Diuretic overdose
(B): Osmotic diuresis
(C): Gastroinstestinal fluid loss
(D): Excess production of aldosterone
(E): Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone
",Osmotic diuresis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Osmotic diuresis.

Explanation:
The patient's history and laboratory findings are consistent with osmotic diuresis. Osmotic diuresis occurs when there is an increase in the osmotic pressure of the glomerular filtrate, leading to increased urine production. In this case, the patient's high serum glucose level (indicated by the elevated Hemoglobin A1C) is causing an osmotic diuresis. The high glucose levels in the blood exceed the renal threshold for glucose reabsorption, resulting in glucose being excreted in the urine. This leads to an osmotic effect, drawing water into the urine and increasing urine output.

The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness are likely due to dehydration resulting from the osmotic diuresis. The low blood pressure and increased heart rate are compensatory mechanisms to maintain perfusion to vital organs in the setting of decreased blood volume.

The laboratory findings also support the diagnosis of osmotic diuresis. The elevated serum sodium (Na+) and osmolality, along with the normal urine osmolality, indicate that the patient is losing more free water than solutes in the urine. The elevated serum bicarbonate (HCO3-) level is likely a compensatory response to the metabolic acidosis caused by the increased excretion of bicarbonate in the urine.

The other options are not supported by the patient's history and laboratory findings. Diuretic overdose (option A) would typically result in increased urine output, but the patient's urine output is described as ""a normal amount"" each time. Gastrointestinal fluid loss (option C) would typically result in decreased urine output, not increased urine output. Excess production of aldosterone (option D) would lead to sodium retention and increased urine osmolality, which is not seen in this patient. Insufficient production of antidiuretic hormone (option E) would result in decreased urine osmolality, not the elevated urine osmolality seen in this patient.",
"A 38-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for her yearly exam. Her only complaint is difficulty losing weight. Her BMI is 34 kg/m^2. In addition to a standard physical exam, the physician orders a glucose tolerance test. The woman's fasting blood glucose level is 120 mg/dL and two-hour post 75g glucose load blood glucose level is 190 mg/dL. The physician informs the patient that she is ""pre-diabetic"" or at risk of developing diabetes and recommends lifestyle modification with follow-up in 6 months. Which of the following endogenous signaling molecules or receptors will increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?
Options:
(A): Catecholamines
(B): Glucagon
(C): Glucocorticoids
(D): Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
(E): TNF-alpha
",Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

Explanation:
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) is a nuclear receptor that plays a key role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism. It is primarily expressed in adipose tissue and is involved in adipocyte differentiation and insulin sensitivity.

In this patient, who is at risk of developing diabetes due to her pre-diabetic state, increasing insulin sensitivity is crucial to prevent the progression to diabetes. PPAR-gamma agonists, such as thiazolidinediones (TZDs), are known to improve insulin sensitivity by increasing glucose uptake in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, reducing hepatic glucose production, and enhancing insulin signaling.

Therefore, activating PPAR-gamma with medications like TZDs can help increase insulin sensitivity in this patient and potentially prevent the development of diabetes. Lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and exercise, can also have a positive impact on insulin sensitivity and are recommended in addition to medication therapy.",
"A 35-year-old male presents to the emergency department for evaluation of hemoptysis. A chest X-ray reveals bilateral focal pulmonary consolidation. On further questioning, he admits having hematuria. Urinalysis shows RBC casts and 400 mL of urine is excreted in 24 hours. What is the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient?
Options:
(A): Anti-Smith antibodies
(B): Anti-neutrophil antibodies
(C): Anti-mitochondrial antibodies
(D): Anti-nuclear antibodies
(E): Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies
",Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies.

Explanation:
The presence of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient, along with the finding of RBC casts in the urine, suggests a glomerular origin for the bleeding. The most likely cause in this case is anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies.

Anti-GBM antibodies are associated with a condition called Goodpasture's syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of antibodies against the basement membrane of the glomerulus in the kidneys and the alveoli of the lungs. This immune-mediated disease leads to inflammation and damage to both the kidneys and the lungs.

The bilateral focal pulmonary consolidation seen on the chest X-ray is consistent with alveolar hemorrhage, which is a characteristic feature of Goodpasture's syndrome. The hematuria and RBC casts in the urine indicate glomerular involvement and further support the diagnosis of anti-GBM disease.

The other options listed (A: Anti-Smith antibodies, B: Anti-neutrophil antibodies, C: Anti-mitochondrial antibodies, D: Anti-nuclear antibodies) are associated with other autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and other connective tissue disorders. However, none of these conditions are typically associated with both hemoptysis and hematuria.

Therefore, the most likely cause of hemoptysis and hematuria in this patient is anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, suggesting Goodpasture's syndrome.",
"A 34-year-old man comes to the physician with a 2-month history of difficulty concentrating at work. He is worried he may lose his job due to poor performance. He feels constantly tired but attributes his fatigue to waking up early most mornings and being unable to fall back asleep. His wife has noticed that he has been speaking more slowly than usual and his appetite has decreased. He used to enjoy dance classes with her but has not been as interested in this recently. He is a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Major depressive disorder
(B): Persistent depressive disorder
(C): Adjustment disorder
(D): Acute stress disorder
(E): Post traumatic stress disorder
",Major depressive disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Major depressive disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with major depressive disorder. He has been experiencing difficulty concentrating, fatigue, decreased appetite, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. These symptoms have been present for at least 2 months, which meets the duration criteria for a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not better explained by another diagnosis, such as adjustment disorder or acute stress disorder. The patient's history of being a veteran who returned from a deployment to Afghanistan 2 years ago may contribute to the development of major depressive disorder, but it is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Persistent depressive disorder is characterized by a chronic depressed mood lasting for at least 2 years, which does not fit the patient's presentation.",
"A 25-year-old female presents to her primary care physician complaining of double vision. She first started seeing double after a long day at her work as a radiation technologist. Since then, her vision has appeared to worsen in the evenings. She has also felt worsening fatigue despite no change in her work hours or sleep habits. She has a history of type I diabetes mellitus and her most recent hemoglobin A1c was 7.4%. Her family history is notable for Sjogren’s syndrome in her mother and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and carotid dissection in her father. Her temperature is 98.9°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 75/min, and respirations are 16/min. On examination, her pupils are equally round and reactive to light. Extraocular movements are intact. Mild ptosis is noted bilaterally but worse on the left. A visual acuity test reveals no abnormalities. Which of the following medications is most appropriate in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Pyridostigmine
(B): Physostigmine
(C): Edrophonium
(D): Hydrocortisone
(E): Azathioprine
",Pyridostigmine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Pyridostigmine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of double vision, worsening in the evenings, and fatigue, along with the presence of mild ptosis, the most likely diagnosis is myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, often involving the muscles of the eyes and eyelids. The patient's family history of autoimmune disease (Sjogren's syndrome) further supports this diagnosis.

Pyridostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor and is the first-line treatment for MG. It works by increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, improving muscle strength and reducing symptoms. Physostigmine and edrophonium are also cholinesterase inhibitors, but they are not commonly used in the treatment of MG. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid and may be used as an adjunctive therapy in MG, but it is not the initial treatment of choice. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive medication that may be used in MG, but it is typically reserved for patients who do not respond adequately to cholinesterase inhibitors.

Therefore, the most appropriate medication in the management of this patient with MG is pyridostigmine.",
"A 76-year-old woman visits a physician for a general medical examination. She is asymptomatic. Six months prior, she had a cerebral stroke with left hemiparesis, from which she has almost completely recovered with physiotherapy. She has a history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF). She has no significant ischemic, valvular, or structural heart disease. She takes metoprolol, amlodipine, warfarin, and atorvastatin. Blood pressure is 125/70 mm Hg, pulse is 75/min with an irregular rhythm. Respirations are 13/min. She has a minor limp and weakness in her left arm and leg. Heart exam shows no abnormalities other than irregular beats. To assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy in this patient, which of the following studies should be ordered?
Options:
(A): Echocardiogram
(B): Electrocardiogram
(C): International normalized ratio
(D): Partial thromboplastin time
(E): Serum drug levels
",International normalized ratio,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) International normalized ratio.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and a recent stroke, the most appropriate study to assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy is the international normalized ratio (INR). The patient is taking warfarin, which is an anticoagulant used to prevent blood clots in patients with AF. The INR measures the effectiveness of warfarin therapy by assessing the patient's blood clotting time. The target INR for patients with AF is typically between 2.0 and 3.0. By monitoring the INR, the physician can determine if the patient is taking the medication as prescribed and if the dosage needs to be adjusted to maintain the desired therapeutic range. 

An echocardiogram (option A) is not necessary in this patient as there is no significant ischemic, valvular, or structural heart disease mentioned in the history or physical examination. An echocardiogram is typically used to evaluate the structure and function of the heart.

An electrocardiogram (option B) may show the irregular rhythm associated with atrial fibrillation, but it does not provide information about adherence or therapeutic efficacy of the medication.

Partial thromboplastin time (option D) is not the most appropriate study in this case. It is used to monitor the effectiveness of heparin therapy, not warfarin.

Serum drug levels (option E) may be useful in some cases to assess adherence and therapeutic efficacy, but it is not the most appropriate study in this patient. Monitoring the INR provides more specific information about the effectiveness of warfarin therapy.

Therefore, the correct choice is (C) International normalized ratio.",
"A 4-year-old boy is brought to his primary care physician for a physical prior to beginning a preschool program. He is found to be delayed in reaching normal childhood cognitive and social milestones, which is consistent with observations at previous check-ups. Physically, he is also found to be significantly overweight with hypogonadism. Notably, the boy was limp when he was born and did not have a normal motor response to stimuli. Elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone are associated with the cause of this patient's weight gain. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in which of the following cell types?
Options:
(A): D cells
(B): G cells
(C): I cells
(D): P/D1 cells
(E): L cells
",P/D1 cells,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): P/D1 cells.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient's significant weight gain is associated with elevated levels of a gastrointestinal hormone. The hormone that is most responsible for causing the weight gain is produced in P/D1 cells.

P/D1 cells, also known as PP cells, are found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. These cells produce pancreatic polypeptide (PP), which is a gastrointestinal hormone involved in regulating appetite and food intake. Elevated levels of PP can lead to increased appetite and weight gain.

In this patient, the significant weight gain, along with other physical findings such as hypogonadism and delayed milestones, suggests a possible underlying endocrine disorder. The elevated levels of PP hormone produced by P/D1 cells may contribute to the excessive weight gain observed in this patient.

It is important to note that the other cell types mentioned in the options (D cells, G cells, I cells, and L cells) are also involved in the production of various gastrointestinal hormones, but they are not specifically associated with the weight gain observed in this patient.",
"Accurate and rapid identification of individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is crucial to accomplishing the goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) to eliminate this disease. One of the key strategies for the detection of TB is the use of tuberculin skin testing as a globally pertinent screening method, due to its low cost and technical simplicity. A study from Brazil demonstrated 76.7% accuracy, 67.9% sensitivity, 84.4% specificity, 79.1% positive predictive value, and 75% negative predictive value when using 5-mm skin elevation as a threshold, or cut-off, point for the screening test (following intradermal injection). Lowering the cut-off point to 4 mm would also result in an increase in which test property?
Options:
(A): Convergent validity
(B): Discriminant validity
(C): Positive predictive value
(D): Negative predictive value
(E): Test specificity
",Negative predictive value,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Negative predictive value.

Explanation:
Lowering the cut-off point from 5 mm to 4 mm would result in an increase in the negative predictive value. Negative predictive value is the probability that a person with a negative test result truly does not have the disease. By lowering the cut-off point, more individuals would be classified as negative, reducing the number of false negatives and increasing the negative predictive value. This means that if a person has a negative test result with a 4 mm cut-off point, there is a higher probability that they truly do not have tuberculosis.",
"A 55-year-old caucasian male is transferred to a tertiary care hospital from a small county hospital where he presented with jaundice and severe abdominal pain that radiates to the back. While in the county hospital, he did not develop fever, and his vital signs were stable for the 48 hours he spent at there. Initial laboratory tests are given below:
Total bilirubin 7 mg/dL
Direct bilirubin 6.4 mg/dL
AST 100
ALT 40
Alkaline phosphatase 480 IU/L
Glucose 160 mg/dL
The patient’s medical history is relevant for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. He admits to smoking cigarettes since his early teenage years. Moderate icterus is evident during physical examination, the abdomen is distended and dull to percussion, and there is periumbilical tenderness. Which of the following markers would you expect to be elevated in this patient?
Options:
(A): CA 125
(B): Alpha-fetoprotein
(C): Desmin
(D): CA 27-29
(E): CA 19-9
",CA 19-9,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): CA 19-9.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of jaundice, severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, and laboratory findings of elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, the most likely diagnosis is pancreatic cancer. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that is commonly elevated in pancreatic cancer. Therefore, in this patient, we would expect CA 19-9 to be elevated. 

CA 125 is a tumor marker that is commonly elevated in ovarian cancer, not pancreatic cancer. Alpha-fetoprotein is a tumor marker that is commonly elevated in liver cancer, not pancreatic cancer. Desmin is a marker for muscle tissue and is not specific to any particular cancer. CA 27-29 is a tumor marker that is commonly elevated in breast cancer, not pancreatic cancer.",
"A one-week-old, full-term infant born by uncomplicated vaginal delivery is brought to a pediatrician by his mother, who notes that her daughter's skin appears yellow. She reports that the child cries several times per day and sleeps 7-8 hours at night, uninterrupted. She has been breastfeeding exclusively and feels that he has been feeding well. Which of the following is the best treatment for this condition?
Options:
(A): Phototherapy
(B): Phenobarbital administration
(C): Plasma exchange
(D): Switch from breast milk to formula
(E): Continue normal breast feeding
",Continue normal breast feeding,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Continue normal breast feeding.

Explanation:
The infant in this scenario is presenting with jaundice, which is a common condition in newborns. Jaundice occurs when there is an excess of bilirubin in the blood, leading to a yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes. In most cases, jaundice in newborns is benign and resolves on its own without treatment.

Breast milk jaundice is a type of jaundice that occurs in breastfed infants. It is caused by substances in breast milk that can interfere with the breakdown and elimination of bilirubin. Breast milk jaundice typically appears after the first week of life and can last for several weeks.

The best treatment for breast milk jaundice is to continue normal breastfeeding. Breast milk provides essential nutrients and hydration for the infant, and stopping breastfeeding can lead to dehydration and other complications. It is important for the mother to ensure that the infant is breastfeeding effectively and getting enough milk. Signs of adequate milk intake include at least six wet diapers per day and a change in the color of stools from dark green to yellow.

Phototherapy is a treatment option for jaundice, but it is usually reserved for cases of severe or prolonged jaundice that do not resolve with breastfeeding alone. Phenobarbital administration and plasma exchange are not indicated for the treatment of breast milk jaundice.

In summary, the best treatment for breast milk jaundice in this scenario is to continue normal breastfeeding, as long as the infant is breastfeeding effectively and getting enough milk.",
"A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Diabetic polyuria
(B): Overactive detrusor muscle
(C): Primary polydipsia
(D): Urethral hypermobility
(E): Vescicovaginal fistula
",Urethral hypermobility,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Urethral hypermobility.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of urinary leakage that occurs with activities such as laughing or coughing, as well as the observation of urine leakage during Valsalva maneuver, are consistent with stress urinary incontinence. Stress urinary incontinence is the most common type of urinary incontinence in women and is characterized by the loss of urine during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising.

Risk factors for stress urinary incontinence include pregnancy, vaginal delivery, and pelvic floor muscle weakness. The patient's history of uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and cesarean section 4 years ago are significant risk factors for the development of stress urinary incontinence.

Urethral hypermobility is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Urethral hypermobility refers to the descent of the bladder neck and urethra during activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, leading to the loss of urine. This descent is due to weakness or disruption of the pelvic floor muscles and connective tissues that support the urethra.

The other options are not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms:
(A) Diabetic polyuria is excessive urination due to uncontrolled diabetes, but the patient does not have symptoms of diabetes or risk factors for diabetes.
(B) Overactive detrusor muscle is characterized by urinary urgency and frequency, but the patient does not have these symptoms.
(C) Primary polydipsia is excessive thirst and fluid intake, but the patient's fluid intake is within normal limits.
(E) Vesicovaginal fistula is an abnormal connection between the bladder and vagina, leading to continuous urinary leakage, but the patient's symptoms are intermittent and related to activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure.",
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after an episode of altered mental status. She was at a party when she suddenly fell to the floor. Her friends state that she was not responsive and was acting oddly. After the episode, the patient seemed confused and had no memory of the event. The patient has a past medical history of substance abuse, depression, and anxiety. Her temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), blood pressure is 117/69 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 12/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam reveals a girl who seems confused and responds to questions slowly. Her gait is stable, and she demonstrates 5/5 strength in her upper and lower extremities. Laboratory values and a urine dipstick test are performed as seen below:

Toxicology:
Benzodiazepines: Positive
Marijuana: Positive
Cocaine: Negative
Phencyclidine: Negative

Urine Dipstick:
Appearance: Dark
Red blood cells: Positive
Glucose: Negative

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Diazepam
(B): Electroencelphalography
(C): IV fluids and mannitol
(D): Phenytoin
(E): Supportive therapy and observation
",IV fluids and mannitol,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) IV fluids and mannitol.

Explanation:
The patient's altered mental status, confusion, and memory loss after a sudden fall suggest a possible seizure. The positive toxicology screen for benzodiazepines and marijuana further supports this possibility. The absence of fever and stable vital signs make other causes of altered mental status less likely.

The dark urine appearance and positive red blood cells on the urine dipstick suggest the presence of rhabdomyolysis, which can occur during a seizure due to muscle breakdown. Rhabdomyolysis can lead to acute kidney injury and electrolyte imbalances.

The best next step in management is to provide supportive care and address the potential complications of rhabdomyolysis. IV fluids are essential to maintain hydration and prevent kidney injury. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, can be used to promote urine output and prevent acute kidney injury. Electrolyte monitoring and correction may also be necessary.

Diazepam (option A) is a benzodiazepine and would not be appropriate in this case since the patient already has positive toxicology screen for benzodiazepines.

Electroencephalography (option B) may be useful in evaluating seizure activity, but it is not the best initial step in management. The patient's clinical presentation and positive toxicology screen provide sufficient evidence to initiate treatment without further testing.

Phenytoin (option D) is an antiepileptic medication that may be used for seizure management, but it is not the best initial step in this case. The patient's altered mental status and positive toxicology screen suggest recent benzodiazepine use, and diazepam would be a more appropriate choice if antiepileptic medication is needed.

Supportive therapy and observation (option E) alone would not address the potential complications of rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. IV fluids and mannitol are necessary to prevent and manage these complications.",
"A 47-year-old woman presents to a physician for evaluation of vomiting and diarrhea for 2 days. Her symptoms began following a company picnic a few days ago. Initially, she was unable to tolerate any solids or liquids by mouth, but now has been able to drink sips of water. She had a mild headache, which was relieved with acetaminophen. The past medical history is unremarkable. She does not take any medications. The blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg and the heart rate is 60/min. On examination, the mucous membranes are dry and the eyes are slightly sunken. Where is most of the sodium reabsorbed in this patient’s kidneys?
Options:
(A): Collecting duct
(B): Distal tubule
(C): Descending limb of loop of Henle
(D): Proximal tubule
(E): Ascending limb of loop of Henle
",Proximal tubule,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Proximal tubule.

Explanation:
In this patient's case, she is experiencing vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. The dry mucous membranes and slightly sunken eyes are signs of dehydration.

In the kidneys, most of the sodium reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule. The proximal tubule is responsible for reabsorbing approximately 65% of the filtered sodium. This reabsorption is important for maintaining sodium balance and regulating extracellular fluid volume.

In conditions of dehydration, such as in this patient, the body tries to conserve sodium and water. The proximal tubule plays a crucial role in this process by reabsorbing sodium back into the bloodstream. This reabsorption helps to maintain blood pressure and prevent further fluid loss.

Therefore, in this patient's case, most of the sodium reabsorption is occurring in the proximal tubule of the kidneys.",
"A one-week-old boy presents with yellow sclerae, severe lethargy, and decreased muscle tone. His mother notes that the symptoms started shortly after birth and have been progressively worsening. The patient is breast fed and takes no medications. His labs are within normal limits with the exception of his liver function tests as follows:

ALT: 8 U/ L
AST: 10 U/L
Alkaline phosphatase: 50 U/L
Albumin: 3.7 g/dL
Total protein: 6.7 g/dL
Bilirubin, total: 29.4 mg/dL
Bilirubin, unconjugated: 29.2 mg/dL
Bilirubin, conjugated: 0.2 mg/dL

The boy is taken immediately for treatment. What is the most likely underlying cause of his condition?
Options:
(A): Deficiency in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(B): Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1
(C): Alteration in the ankyrin protein
(D): Reduction in UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 activity
(E): Deficiency in glucocerebrosidase
",Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1.

The patient's presentation of yellow sclerae, severe lethargy, and decreased muscle tone, along with the laboratory findings of elevated total bilirubin and unconjugated bilirubin, are consistent with a diagnosis of neonatal jaundice. Neonatal jaundice is a common condition in newborns and is usually due to an immature liver that is unable to effectively process bilirubin, resulting in its accumulation in the body.

In this case, the elevated unconjugated bilirubin and normal conjugated bilirubin levels suggest a problem with bilirubin conjugation, which is the process by which bilirubin is converted into a water-soluble form for excretion. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1 (UGT1A1) is the enzyme responsible for this conjugation process. The absence of UGT1A1 activity leads to unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is seen in conditions such as Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1 and Gilbert syndrome.

Given the severe symptoms and rapidly worsening course in this patient, the most likely underlying cause is the absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1, which is seen in Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a complete absence of UGT1A1 activity. Without treatment, the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin can lead to kernicterus, a condition characterized by bilirubin deposition in the brain, resulting in neurologic damage.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is the absence of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase-1A1.",
"A researcher is conducting an experiment on the mouse kidney to study the relative concentrations between the tubular fluid and plasma of a number of substances along the proximal convoluted tubule. Based on the graph shown in figure A, which of the following best describes the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea?
Options:
(A): A
(B): B
(C): C
(D): D
(E): E
",B,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) B.

Explanation:
According to the information provided in the context, the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea increases as the filtrate moves along the tubular system. This indicates that relatively more urea has been reabsorbed than water. In the graph shown in figure A, the tubular fluid-to-plasma concentration ratio of urea is greater than 1, which supports the idea that urea is being reabsorbed. Therefore, option B is the correct choice.",
"A 62-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine. He reports alternating episodes of decreased urine output followed by a temporary increase in urine output for the past 2 days. In the past year, he has had two urinary tract infections. He has Crohn disease and underwent a small bowel resection 5 years ago. He currently takes mesalamine and a multivitamin. His father had recurrent kidney stones. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. Urinalysis shows 70 RBC/hpf and envelope-shaped crystals. A CT scan of the abdomen shows a 6-mm stone in the proximal right ureter and two 4-mm stones in the left kidney. Which of the following factors has most likely contributed most to this patient’s current condition?
Options:
(A): Parathyroid gland adenoma
(B): Excess vitamin D
(C): Recurrent urinary tract infections
(D): Malabsorption of fatty acids
(E): High urine pH
",Malabsorption of fatty acids,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Malabsorption of fatty acids.

Explanation:
This patient's history of Crohn disease and small bowel resection suggests malabsorption as a possible cause of his current condition. Malabsorption can lead to fat malabsorption, which can result in the formation of calcium soaps in the intestines. These calcium soaps can then be excreted in the urine, leading to the formation of envelope-shaped crystals. Additionally, fat malabsorption can lead to the formation of oxalate stones, which can contribute to the development of kidney stones. The patient's symptoms of right-sided back pain, nausea, and dark urine are consistent with renal colic and hematuria, which are commonly seen in patients with kidney stones. The presence of stones in both the right ureter and left kidney on CT scan further supports the diagnosis of kidney stones. Therefore, malabsorption of fatty acids is the most likely factor contributing to this patient's current condition.",
"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician because he has excessively dry skin. His mother says that he has had dry, scaly skin since he was 6 months old. She says it is worse in winter and better in summer. There is no associated itching, redness, or discharge. Examination reveals generalized fine scales with coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae (see image). There are multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Psoriasis
(B): Lichen simplex
(C): Ichthyosis vulgaris
(D): Pityriasis versicolor
(E): X-linked ichthyosis
",Ichthyosis vulgaris,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Ichthyosis vulgaris.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of excessively dry, scaly skin since infancy, worse in winter and better in summer, along with generalized fine scales and coarse skin all over the body, except in the skin creases of the neck and in the cubital and popliteal fossae, is consistent with the diagnosis of Ichthyosis vulgaris.

Ichthyosis vulgaris is a genetic disorder characterized by a defect in the formation of the stratum corneum, leading to impaired skin barrier function and excessive transepidermal water loss. This results in dry, scaly skin with a ""fish scale"" appearance. The condition is usually present from infancy and tends to improve with age.

The presence of multiple papular elevations at the base of hair follicles and darkening of the palmar and plantar creases are additional features commonly seen in Ichthyosis vulgaris.

Psoriasis (option A) typically presents with thick, coarse scales and well-defined borders, which are not seen in this patient. Lichen simplex (option B) is characterized by thickened, lichenified skin due to chronic scratching and rubbing, which is not described in this case. Pityriasis versicolor (option D) is a superficial fungal infection that presents with hypopigmented or hyperpigmented patches, not dry, scaly skin. X-linked ichthyosis (option E) is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males and is characterized by large, dark, polygonal scales, which are not described in this case.",
"A 29-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department because of vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain for 2 hours. Her current pregnancy was achieved by means of in vitro fertilization due to azoospermia in her partner. Prenatal course has been uncomplicated with regular prenatal visits. After a period of having avoided sexual intercourse during her early pregnancy, she resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a nonreassuring fetal heart rate; her other child was delivered vaginally. She has had abnormal Pap smears due to HPV in the past. Her pulse is 82/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 134/76 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, the uterus is consistent with 24 weeks' gestation, and the fetus is in a cephalic presentation. There are traces of blood on the vulva and the introitus. Speculum examination shows a tender, bruised cervix, with a closed cervical os. Fetal heart rate is 166/min and CTG shows a reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. Ultrasound shows a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall. What is the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding?
Options:
(A): Pedunculated cervical growth
(B): Inflammation of the cervix
(C): Cervical trauma
(D): Fetal vessels overlying cervical os
(E): Premature separation of the placenta
",Cervical trauma,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Cervical trauma.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presents with vaginal bleeding and mild pelvic pain at 24 weeks' gestation. The speculum examination reveals a tender, bruised cervix with a closed cervical os. These findings are consistent with cervical trauma as the most likely cause of the antepartum bleeding.

Cervical trauma can occur due to various reasons, including sexual intercourse, cervical exams, or trauma to the cervix during pregnancy. In this case, the patient resumed sexual activity with her partner at week 22 of gestation, which could have caused the cervical trauma leading to the bleeding.

The presence of a uniformly echogenic placenta located at the fundal end of the posterior uterine wall on ultrasound suggests a normal placental location and rules out placenta previa (option D). Fetal vessels overlying the cervical os (option E) would typically be seen in cases of vasa previa, which is not consistent with the clinical presentation in this case.

Pedunculated cervical growth (option A) and inflammation of the cervix (option B) are less likely causes of antepartum bleeding in this patient, given the findings on speculum examination and the absence of other symptoms or risk factors.

Premature separation of the placenta (option F), also known as placental abruption, typically presents with sudden-onset, painful vaginal bleeding, and a non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing. In this case, the fetal heart rate is reassuring, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with cervical trauma.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's antepartum bleeding is cervical trauma.",
"A 16-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room with acute vomiting and abdominal pain that began earlier today. His parents say that the boy was doing well until two days ago when he told them that he was feeling unwell. He has diabetes and takes insulin but stopped taking it when he began to feel poorly two days ago. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respirations are shallow and rapid with a rate of 33/min, pulse is 107/min, and blood pressure is 101/68 mm Hg. He appears severely dehydrated, showing signs of fatigue, and poor skin turgor. His breath has a fruity smell to it. His blood glucose level is 691 mg/dL. Blood is drawn for labs and the results are given below:
Serum:  
  pH: 7.21
  pCO2: 32 mm HG
  HCO 3-: 15.2 mEq/L
Sodium: 122 mEq/L
Potassium: 5.8 mEq/L
Urinalysis is positive for ketone bodies. What is the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Administer IV fluids and insulin
(B): Administer IV antibiotics
(C): Administer IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications
(D): Administer IV bicarbonate
(E): Administer potassium and magnesium
",Administer IV fluids and insulin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Administer IV fluids and insulin.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), which is a life-threatening complication of uncontrolled diabetes. The presence of vomiting, abdominal pain, fruity breath odor, and positive urine ketones are all indicative of DKA. The laboratory results also support the diagnosis, with a low pH, low bicarbonate, and elevated blood glucose level.

The immediate management of DKA involves rehydration and insulin therapy. IV fluids are necessary to correct the severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that occur in DKA. Insulin is essential to lower blood glucose levels and promote the utilization of glucose for energy instead of fat breakdown, which leads to the production of ketones.

Administering IV antibiotics (B) is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with DKA, not an infection.

Administering IV fluids with oral antidiabetic medications (C) is not appropriate in this situation. Oral antidiabetic medications are not effective in treating DKA, and the patient's severe dehydration requires immediate rehydration with IV fluids.

Administering IV bicarbonate (D) is not the first-line treatment for DKA. Bicarbonate therapy is reserved for severe acidosis (pH <7.0), which is not present in this case.

Administering potassium and magnesium (E) may be necessary in the management of DKA, as these electrolytes are often depleted. However, the immediate priority is to correct the severe dehydration and initiate insulin therapy. Electrolyte replacement can be addressed once the patient is stabilized.",
"A 28-year-old male presents to the emergency department with chest pain. He reports that one hour ago he was climbing the stairs in his home when he suddenly developed excruciating chest pain. He describes the pain as ripping and radiating to the back. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a heart murmur that is being followed by his outpatient cardiologist. He takes no medications. The patient works as a carpenter and reports being monogamous with his wife. He denies any history of intravenous drug use or recent travel. In the emergency department, the patient’s temperature is 99.4°F (37.4°C), blood pressure is 94/56 mmHg, pulse is 121/min, and respirations are 14/min. On physical exam, the patient appears to be in moderate distress and is clutching his chest. He is tall and has joint hypermobility. His breath sounds are equal and full bilaterally and has weak distal pulses.

Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient?
Options:
(A): Holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border
(B): Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click
(C): Mid-diastolic murmur at the apex with opening snap
(D): Mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border
(E): Systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space
",Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex with mid-systolic click.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. The patient's sudden onset of severe chest pain that radiates to the back, along with the description of the pain as ripping, is highly suggestive of aortic dissection. The patient's tall stature and joint hypermobility are also consistent with Marfan syndrome, which is a risk factor for aortic dissection.

In aortic dissection, there can be involvement of the aortic valve, leading to aortic regurgitation. This can result in a late systolic crescendo murmur at the apex. The mid-systolic click is characteristic of mitral valve prolapse, which is commonly seen in patients with Marfan syndrome.

The other options are less likely to be found in this patient. A holosystolic, high-pitched blowing murmur at the lower left sternal border is characteristic of a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which typically presents in childhood and is not associated with aortic dissection. A mid-diastolic murmur at the apex with an opening snap is characteristic of mitral stenosis, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. A mid-diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border is characteristic of tricuspid regurgitation, which is not likely in this patient. A systolic ejection murmur at the right second intercostal space is characteristic of aortic stenosis, which is also not consistent with the patient's presentation.",
"A mother brings her 6-year-old daughter to the pediatrician to discuss her child's sleeping troubles. Three times now in the last month the child has begun screaming and crying in the middle of the night. When the parents rush to the child's room, they find her crying inconsolably. They try to ask her what is wrong, but she does not respond and persists crying for approximately 20 minutes, after which she goes back to sleeping comfortably. Upon awaking the following morning, she has no recollection of the night's events. Which of the following is true about these episodes?
Options:
(A): They will be persistent into adulthood
(B): They occur only during non-REM sleep
(C): They can occur any time during the sleep cycle
(D): They are associated with child abuse
(E): They are associated with later development of a mood disorder
",They occur only during non-REM sleep,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) They occur only during non-REM sleep.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the child's episodes of screaming and crying occur in the middle of the night and last for approximately 20 minutes. The child does not respond to the parents' questions and has no recollection of the events the next morning. These characteristics are consistent with night terrors, which are a type of parasomnia that occurs during non-REM sleep. Night terrors typically occur in the first third of the night and are characterized by sudden awakenings with intense fear and autonomic arousal. The child may appear frightened, scream, and have a rapid heart rate and breathing. Unlike nightmares, the child does not recall the details of the episode. Night terrors are most common in children between the ages of 3 and 8 and tend to resolve with maturation. Therefore, the correct answer is that these episodes occur only during non-REM sleep.",
"An 18-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a pruritic rash on her back for the past 2 hours. This morning, she started a course of ceftriaxone for treatment of pyelonephritis. A photograph of the rash is shown. This patient's skin findings are most likely associated with which of the following?
Options:
(A): Perivascular cutaneous polymorphonuclear infiltration
(B): Direct tissue damage by irradiated antibiotic agent
(C): Cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells
(D): Hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature
(E): Mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues
",Hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature.

Explanation:
The patient's pruritic rash is most likely a result of an allergic reaction to the ceftriaxone antibiotic she started taking for pyelonephritis. The rash is characterized by erythematous papules and plaques, which are consistent with urticaria. Urticaria is a type of allergic reaction that is mediated by the release of histamine from mast cells in the skin. Histamine causes vasodilation and increased permeability of the superficial dermal microvasculature, leading to the characteristic rash. This is why option (D) is the correct answer.

Option (A) is incorrect because perivascular cutaneous polymorphonuclear infiltration is not typically seen in urticaria. This finding is more commonly associated with vasculitis.

Option (B) is incorrect because direct tissue damage by irradiated antibiotic agent is not a mechanism of urticaria.

Option (C) is incorrect because cytotoxic T-cell destruction of antigen-tagged cells is not a mechanism of urticaria. This finding is more commonly associated with delayed hypersensitivity reactions.

Option (E) is incorrect because mast cell activation in subcutaneous tissues is a mechanism of urticaria, but it does not explain the specific finding of hyperpermeability of superficial dermal microvasculature.",
"Two hours after admission to the hospital for dialysis, a 63-year-old woman has severe pain in her lower back. The pain is 8 out of 10 in intensity and radiates down the legs. She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy 4 years ago. She has hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and major depressive disorder. She lives with her daughter and reports frequent fights with her at home. Her current medications include sertraline, insulin, enalapril, sodium bicarbonate, and sevelamer. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 132/94 mm Hg. There is severe tenderness on palpation over the L2 vertebra; range of motion is limited. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL
Leukocyte count 8,700/mm3
Platelet count 130,000/mm3
Serum
Na+ 136 mEq/L
Cl- 101 mEq/L

Calcium 8.2 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen 33 mg/dL
Glucose 190 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.8 mg/dL
An x-ray of the spine shows a wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?""
Options:
(A): Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
(B): Secondary hyperparathyroidism
(C): Elder abuse
(D): Pseudohypoparathyroidism
(E): Primary hyperparathyroidism
",Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Explanation:
The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and dialysis suggests that she may have secondary hyperparathyroidism. Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs as a compensatory response to chronic kidney disease, which leads to decreased activation of vitamin D and decreased calcium absorption. This results in hypocalcemia and increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion. The increased PTH levels cause bone resorption, leading to osteoporosis and an increased risk of fractures. The wedge compression fracture of the L2 vertebra seen on x-ray is consistent with osteoporosis. The patient's laboratory findings also support the diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism, as she has hypocalcemia (calcium 8.2 mg/dL) and an elevated PTH level (not provided in the question). The severe pain in the lower back that radiates down the legs is likely due to the compression fracture. The other answer choices are not supported by the patient's history, physical examination findings, or laboratory results.",
"A 50-year-old man comes to the physician because of swelling of his legs for 2 months. Three months ago, he was diagnosed with hypertension and started on a new medication. His blood pressure is 145/95 mm Hg. Physical examination shows 2+ edema in both lower extremities. Laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. This patient was most likely treated with which of the following drugs?
Options:
(A): Losartan
(B): Lisinopril
(C): Spironolactone
(D): Hydrochlorothiazide
(E): Amlodipine
",Amlodipine,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Amlodipine.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of swelling in the legs (edema) is a common side effect of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as amlodipine. Amlodipine is a commonly prescribed medication for hypertension, and it works by relaxing the blood vessels, reducing the workload on the heart, and improving blood flow. However, one of the side effects of CCBs is peripheral edema, which can cause swelling in the legs.

Losartan (A) and lisinopril (B) are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are also commonly prescribed for hypertension. While they can cause a dry cough as a side effect, they are not typically associated with peripheral edema.

Spironolactone (C) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is often used in the treatment of heart failure and edema. However, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for hypertension.

Hydrochlorothiazide (D) is a thiazide diuretic that is commonly used to treat hypertension. While it can cause electrolyte imbalances and fluid retention, it is less likely to cause peripheral edema compared to amlodipine.

Propranolol (F) is a beta-blocker that is used to treat hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions. While it can cause peripheral edema as a side effect, it is not commonly used as a first-line treatment for hypertension.

Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and the most likely medication prescribed for hypertension, the correct answer is (E) Amlodipine.",
"An investigator is studying the function of different enzymes in various human cell types. A subset of normal human cells with an elevated intracellular concentration of bisphosphoglycerate mutase is harvested and isolated. Which of the following is most likely to be absent in these cells?
Options:
(A): α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase
(B): Pyruvate kinase
(C): Glutathione reductase
(D): Lactic acid dehydrogenase
(E): Carbonic anhydrase
",α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

Explanation:
Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme involved in the regulation of oxygen binding to hemoglobin in red blood cells. It catalyzes the conversion of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (1,3-BPG) to 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). This conversion is important in maintaining the appropriate oxygen affinity of hemoglobin.

α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle) in the mitochondria. It catalyzes the conversion of α-ketoglutarate to succinyl-CoA, producing NADH in the process. This enzyme is not directly related to the function of bisphosphoglycerate mutase.

Pyruvate kinase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis, the metabolic pathway that converts glucose into pyruvate. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway, which generates NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. Glutathione reductase is an enzyme involved in the regeneration of reduced glutathione, an important antioxidant molecule. Lactic acid dehydrogenase is an enzyme involved in the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme involved in the conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate in red blood cells.

Based on the information provided, the most likely enzyme to be absent in the subset of cells with elevated bisphosphoglycerate mutase is α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.",
"A 28-year-old woman is brought to the emergency room after a motor vehicle accident. On arrival, she is stable and says that she hit a car at an intersection that ""came out of nowhere"". She states that she had similar close encounters with other cars these past few weeks but was able to avoid collisions with those. She has also had intermittent headaches over the last month and has noticed that her shirts have been getting wet unexpectedly. Blood tests reveal an abnormal elevation of a circulating substance. Which of following changes is also associated with the physiologic function of the most likely substance in this case?
Options:
(A): Decreased oxytocin
(B): Decreased progesterone
(C): Increased follicle stimulating hormone
(D): Increased human chorionic gonadotropin
(E): Increased progesterone
",Decreased progesterone,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Decreased progesterone.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the woman's symptoms and the abnormal elevation of a circulating substance suggest that she may be experiencing a condition called prolactinoma. Prolactinoma is a benign tumor of the pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of prolactin, a hormone responsible for milk production in women.

One of the common symptoms of prolactinoma is galactorrhea, which is the unexpected production of breast milk. The woman's complaint of her shirts getting wet unexpectedly is consistent with this symptom.

In addition to galactorrhea, prolactinoma can also cause headaches. The woman's intermittent headaches over the last month may be related to the tumor.

Progesterone is a hormone involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. In the case of prolactinoma, the tumor causes an increase in prolactin levels, which can suppress the production of progesterone. Therefore, the most likely change associated with the physiologic function of the elevated substance in this case is a decrease in progesterone.

The other options, such as decreased oxytocin, increased follicle stimulating hormone, and increased human chorionic gonadotropin, are not directly related to the symptoms and findings described in the case.",
"A 23-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of episodic headaches associated with dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. Over-the-counter pain medications have failed to reduce her symptoms. An MRI of the brain shows isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. This dilatation is most likely caused by blockade of which of the following structures?
Options:
(A): Arachnoid villi
(B): Interventricular foramen
(C): Median aperture
(D): Lateral apertures
(E): Cerebral aqueduct
",Interventricular foramen,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Interventricular foramen.

Explanation:
The dilation of the left lateral ventricle in this patient is most likely caused by a blockade of the interventricular foramen. The interventricular foramen, also known as the foramen of Monro, connects the lateral ventricles to the third ventricle in the brain. It allows for the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between these structures.

When the interventricular foramen is blocked, the flow of CSF is obstructed, leading to a buildup of fluid in the lateral ventricle. This can result in ventricular dilation, which can cause symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.

The other options are not likely to cause isolated dilation of the left lateral ventricle. Arachnoid villi are responsible for the absorption of CSF into the venous system, but their blockade would not lead to isolated ventricular dilation. The median aperture and lateral apertures are openings in the fourth ventricle that allow for the flow of CSF into the subarachnoid space, but their blockade would not specifically affect the left lateral ventricle. The cerebral aqueduct connects the third and fourth ventricles, and its blockade would lead to dilation of the third ventricle, not the left lateral ventricle.",
"A 20-day-old child is brought to the emergency department by her parents. They are concerned about lethargy and easy bruising. Her mother reports that she has been eating less for the past few days. Today she was difficult to arouse. She normally nurses four-five times a day, but ate less yesterday and this morning. The girl was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care. This is her first visit to a physician of any type. The family is carefully questioned and child abuse is ruled out. The daughter’s pulse is 97/min, respirations are 35/min, temperature is 35.8°C (96.4°F), and blood pressure is 71/46 mm Hg. Physical examination shows diffuse petechiae and bruising. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
Options:
(A): Group B streptococcus (GBS) infection
(B): Hepatitis B infection
(C): Thyroid stimulating hormone deficiency
(D): Vitamin D deficiency
(E): Vitamin K deficiency
",Vitamin K deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Vitamin K deficiency.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the 20-day-old child presents with lethargy, easy bruising, decreased appetite, and difficulty in arousal. These symptoms, along with the presence of diffuse petechiae and bruising, are indicative of a bleeding disorder. Vitamin K deficiency is the most likely cause in this case.

Vitamin K is essential for the production of clotting factors in the liver. Newborns are particularly susceptible to vitamin K deficiency because they have low levels of vitamin K at birth and their intestinal flora, which produce vitamin K, are not fully developed. In this case, the child was born at home with minimal prenatal or postnatal care, which increases the likelihood of not receiving vitamin K at birth.

Bleeding from vitamin K deficiency typically occurs in the first three months of life and can manifest as bleeding from mucosal surfaces, prior incisions (such as circumcision), cutaneous bruising, and deeper muscle bruising. The presence of diffuse petechiae and bruising in this child is consistent with vitamin K deficiency.

It is important to rule out child abuse in cases of suspected bruising in infants. In this case, the family has been carefully questioned and child abuse has been ruled out.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the child's symptoms and findings is vitamin K deficiency. Prompt treatment with vitamin K supplementation is necessary to prevent further bleeding complications.",
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a generalized, non-itchy rash for 2 days. He has also had a fever and sore throat for 4 days. He has not received any routine childhood vaccinations. Examination shows a flushed face except around his mouth. A diffuse, papular, erythematous rash that blanches with pressure is seen over the trunk. Pharyngeal erythema and a red beefy tongue are noted. His leukocyte count is 11,200/mm3 (75% segmented neutrophils, 22% lymphocytes). Without treatment, this patient's current condition puts him at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Hemolytic anemia
(B): Coronary artery aneurysms
(C): Encephalitis
(D): Mitral valve regurgitation
(E): Minimal change disease
",Mitral valve regurgitation,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Mitral valve regurgitation.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Kawasaki disease, which is characterized by fever, rash, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal changes, cervical lymphadenopathy, and extremity changes. Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects medium-sized arteries, including the coronary arteries. Without treatment, Kawasaki disease can lead to the development of coronary artery aneurysms, which can subsequently result in myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, and mitral valve regurgitation. Therefore, the patient's current condition puts him at greatest risk for mitral valve regurgitation. Prompt treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin can reduce the risk of coronary artery complications in Kawasaki disease.",
"A 32-year-old man presents to the emergency department with fever, nausea, and vomiting. The patient states that his symptoms started last night and have persisted to this morning. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his current medications include albuterol and fluticasone. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, the patient seems uncomfortable. He requests that the lights in the room stay turned off during the physical exam. The patient's cardiac exam demonstrates a normal rate and rhythm, and his pulmonary exam is clear to auscultation bilaterally. Musculoskeletal exam reveals diminished mobility of the neck in all four directions, with flexion of the neck causing the patient discomfort. Lumbar puncture is performed and results are seen below.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):
Cell count: 175/mm^3
Cl-: 119 mEq/L
Glucose: 49 mg/dL
Pressure: 150 mmH2O
Total protein: 55 mg/dL

Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Acyclovir
(B): Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine
(C): Ceftriaxone
(D): Ceftriaxone and vancomycin
(E): IV fluids and monitoring
",IV fluids and monitoring,Incorrect,"The correct answer is (B): Amphotericin and 5-flucytosine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and CSF results, the most likely diagnosis is meningitis. The patient's symptoms of fever, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness are consistent with meningitis. The CSF findings of elevated cell count (175/mm^3), low glucose (49 mg/dL), and elevated protein (55 mg/dL) further support this diagnosis.

The most common cause of bacterial meningitis in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is typically treated with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. However, the CSF findings in this patient are not consistent with bacterial meningitis. The glucose level is low, which is more commonly seen in fungal or tuberculous meningitis.

Given the CSF findings and the patient's risk factors (asthma and immunosuppressive medications), the most likely etiology of meningitis in this patient is fungal meningitis. The treatment for fungal meningitis is amphotericin B, which is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent, and 5-flucytosine, which is a synergistic antifungal agent. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis is amphotericin and 5-flucytosine.

Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus or varicella-zoster virus. It is not the appropriate treatment for fungal meningitis.

Ceftriaxone and vancomycin are commonly used to treat bacterial meningitis, but the CSF findings in this patient are not consistent with bacterial meningitis.

IV fluids and monitoring are important supportive measures in the management of meningitis, but they do not address the underlying cause of the infection. Therefore, IV fluids and monitoring alone would not be the best treatment for this patient's most likely diagnosis of fungal meningitis.",
"A 64-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of sore mouth. He says that swallowing is not painful. He has had asthma for more than 20 years. His only medication is a high-dose combination salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 74/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 125/65 mm Hg. A photograph of his oral mucosa is shown. Indirect mirror examination of the posterior oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Azithromycin
(B): Fluconazole
(C): Isotretinoin
(D): Nystatin
(E): Penicillin V
",Nystatin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Nystatin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and presentation, the most likely diagnosis is oral thrush, which is a fungal infection caused by Candida species. The patient's use of a high-dose combination salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler puts him at risk for developing oral thrush, as inhaled corticosteroids can suppress the immune response in the oral cavity and allow for overgrowth of Candida.

Nystatin is an antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat oral thrush. It is effective against Candida species and is available in various formulations, including oral suspensions and lozenges. Nystatin works by binding to the fungal cell membrane and causing leakage of intracellular contents, leading to cell death.

Azithromycin, fluconazole, isotretinoin, and penicillin V are not appropriate choices for the management of oral thrush. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is effective against bacterial infections, not fungal infections. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication, but it is typically reserved for systemic fungal infections and is not the first-line treatment for oral thrush. Isotretinoin is a medication used for the treatment of severe acne and has no role in the management of oral thrush. Penicillin V is an antibiotic that is effective against bacterial infections, not fungal infections.",
"A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of fever, chills, nausea, and flank pain. She has multiple sclerosis and a chronic indwelling bladder catheter for neurogenic bladder dysfunction. One week ago, she was discharged from the hospital after treatment for a multiple sclerosis flare. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.8°C). Physical examination shows marked tenderness in the right costovertebral area. Urine cultures grow a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. The causal organism of this patient's current condition most likely produces which of the following substances?
Options:
(A): Lipoteichoic acid
(B): K capsule
(C): Urease
(D): Toxin B
(E): Pyoverdine
",Pyoverdine,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Pyoverdine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fever, chills, flank pain, and positive urine culture for a non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod, are consistent with a urinary tract infection (UTI). The presence of marked tenderness in the right costovertebral area suggests pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys.

Pyoverdine is a siderophore produced by certain bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a common cause of UTIs in patients with indwelling catheters. Siderophores are iron-chelating molecules that help bacteria scavenge iron from the host, allowing them to survive and replicate. Pyoverdine is a key virulence factor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as it enables the bacteria to acquire iron from the host and establish infection.

Lipoteichoic acid (A) is a component of the cell wall in gram-positive bacteria and is not relevant to this patient's condition.

K capsule (B) is a polysaccharide capsule produced by certain bacteria, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae. It is associated with the virulence of these bacteria but is not relevant to this patient's condition.

Urease (C) is an enzyme produced by certain bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis. It hydrolyzes urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide, leading to an alkaline urine pH and the formation of struvite stones. While urease-producing bacteria can cause UTIs, the clinical presentation and urine culture findings in this patient are not consistent with a urease-producing organism.

Toxin B (D) is produced by Clostridium difficile and is associated with pseudomembranous colitis, not UTIs. The patient's symptoms and urine culture findings are not consistent with C. difficile infection.",
"A 26-year-old man comes to the physician for episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, and a 6-kg (14.2-lb) weight loss over the past 2 months. He reports that the fever lasts for 7 to 10 days, then subsides completely for about a week before returning again. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows nontender cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. An x-ray of the chest shows bilateral mediastinal masses. Resection of a cervical lymph node is performed. A photomicrograph of the resected specimen is shown. Further histopathological examination is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Cells staining positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(B): Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30
(C): Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement
(D): Cells overexpressing Bcl-2
(E): Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation
",Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of episodic fever, recurrent night sweats, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, along with the histopathological findings of the resected specimen, are consistent with the diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells, which are large, abnormal B lymphocytes. These cells typically stain positive for CD15 and CD30, which are markers used to identify Hodgkin lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely finding on further histopathological examination would be cells staining positive for CD15 and CD30. 

Option (A): Cells staining positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase is seen in hairy cell leukemia, not Hodgkin lymphoma.

Option (C): Cells with BCR-ABL rearrangement is seen in chronic myeloid leukemia, not Hodgkin lymphoma.

Option (D): Cells overexpressing Bcl-2 is seen in follicular lymphoma, not Hodgkin lymphoma.

Option (E): Cells with t(8;14) chromosomal translocation is seen in Burkitt lymphoma, not Hodgkin lymphoma.",
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of nausea for the last two weeks. During this period, she has had increased urinary frequency and fatigue. She also reports two episodes of non-bloody vomiting. There is no personal history of serious illness. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. Physical examination shows bilateral breast tenderness. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. Which of the following is the most accurate predictor of the gestational age?
Options:
(A): Ratio of head to abdominal circumference
(B): Serum β-hCG levels
(C): Femoral length
(D): Crown-rump length
(E): Biparietal length
",Crown-rump length,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Crown-rump length.

Explanation:
Crown-rump length (CRL) is the measurement from the top of the baby's head (crown) to the bottom of the baby's buttocks (rump). It is the most accurate predictor of gestational age in the first trimester of pregnancy. The CRL measurement is used to estimate the gestational age and is typically done during an ultrasound examination.

In this case, the patient's last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago, which suggests a gestational age of approximately 6 weeks. However, the CRL measurement would provide a more accurate estimation of the gestational age. Other options such as the ratio of head to abdominal circumference, serum β-hCG levels, femoral length, biparietal length, and mean sac diameter are not as accurate or commonly used for determining gestational age as the CRL measurement.",
"A 6-week-old male infant is brought to the physician by his mother because of a 2-day history of recurrent nonbilious vomiting. Vomiting occurs almost immediately after most feeds. Each time, he becomes irritable while feeding and refuses to finish the bottle. He was born at 37 weeks' gestation and weighed 3300 g (7 lb 4 oz); he currently weighs 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz). He has Down syndrome. His vaccinations are up-to-date. He appears agitated and cries during the examination. His temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 156/min, respirations are 32/min, and blood pressure is 100/49 mm Hg. Examination shows upward slanting of the eyelids, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a single transverse palmar crease on both hands. The abdomen is soft and nontender. A 2.5-cm (1-inch) epigastric mass is palpated. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. Arterial blood gas analysis is within normal limits. Further diagnostic evaluation of the patient is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Dilated colon segment on abdominal x-ray
(B): A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration
(C): Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (EIA)
(D): Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound
(E): Tripple bubble sign on abdominal x-ray
",Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Elongated and thickened pylorus on abdominal ultrasound.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a 6-week-old male infant with recurrent nonbilious vomiting, irritability during feeding, and a palpable epigastric mass is consistent with pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis is a condition characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the circular muscle of the pylorus, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. It typically presents between 3 and 6 weeks of age and is more common in first-born males. The classic presentation includes projectile, nonbilious vomiting that occurs shortly after feeding, irritability during feeding, and a palpable ""olive-shaped"" mass in the epigastrium. The diagnosis is confirmed by abdominal ultrasound, which typically shows an elongated and thickened pylorus. The ""double bubble sign"" (Option A) on abdominal x-ray is seen in duodenal atresia, which presents with bilious vomiting and is not associated with pyloric stenosis. A high serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone concentration (Option B) is seen in congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which typically presents with ambiguous genitalia in females and salt-wasting in both sexes. Detection of rotavirus antigen on enzyme immunoassay (Option C) is used to diagnose rotavirus gastroenteritis, which typically presents with watery diarrhea and vomiting but is not associated with pyloric stenosis. The ""triple bubble sign"" (Option E) on abdominal x-ray is seen in duodenal atresia, not pyloric stenosis.",
"A 5-year-old Syrian immigrant and her family present for an immigration physical. Her mother describes photophobia, bilateral lacrimation, eye itching, and eyelid swelling for the last week. She is known to have an allergy to cephalosporins. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. She has met all of her developmental milestones and most of her vaccines. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 105/60 mm Hg, heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). The physical examination is mostly normal except for her eye exam as presented in the image below. Which of the following statements is true regarding treatment of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): A third-generation cephalosporin would be the best treatment option in case the child did not have an actual allergy.
(B): The child should be treated with topical bacitracin.
(C): The best treatment option is oral tetracycline.
(D): The child should be administered a single dose of oral azithromycin.
(E): Surgical resection is the most appropriate treatment in this case.
",The child should be administered a single dose of oral azithromycin.,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): The child should be administered a single dose of oral azithromycin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of photophobia, bilateral lacrimation, eye itching, and eyelid swelling, along with the physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is trachoma. Trachoma is a chronic, contagious infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide.

The recommended treatment for trachoma is a single dose of oral azithromycin. Azithromycin is effective against Chlamydia trachomatis and has been shown to be more effective than topical antibiotics. It is also more convenient for patients, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare.

Topical bacitracin is not the best treatment option for trachoma. While it may be effective against some bacterial infections, it is not the first-line treatment for trachoma.

Oral tetracycline is another option for the treatment of trachoma, but it is less commonly used due to concerns about side effects and the need for multiple doses over a longer duration compared to azithromycin.

Surgical resection is not the appropriate treatment for trachoma. Surgery may be considered in advanced cases with severe scarring and visual impairment, but it is not the first-line treatment for the initial infection.

Given the patient's allergy to cephalosporins, a third-generation cephalosporin would not be the best treatment option even if the child did not have an actual allergy. Azithromycin is the preferred treatment for trachoma, regardless of cephalosporin allergy.",
"Three days after induction chemotherapy, a 9-year-old boy is admitted to the hospital for fever and neutropenia. He was initially diagnosed with t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia following workup for fatigue and pancytopenia. He is fully conscious. His blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, temperature is 39.5°C (103.1°F), pulse is 98/min, and respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical examination including examination of the central venous catheter site shows no source of infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are initiated. Which of the following factors about this patient most strongly indicates a poor prognosis?
Options:
(A): Age
(B): Cytogenetics
(C): Fever and neutropenia
(D): Initial presentation
(E): Immunological subtype
",Cytogenetics,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Cytogenetics.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient's diagnosis of t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia indicates a poor prognosis. Cytogenetics refers to the study of the structure and function of chromosomes, and abnormalities in cytogenetics can have significant implications for prognosis in cancer patients. The t(9;22) translocation, also known as the Philadelphia chromosome, is associated with a poor prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is commonly found in patients with B-cell ALL, but can also occur in T-cell ALL, as in this case.

The presence of the t(9;22) translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion gene, which produces a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. This leads to uncontrolled proliferation of leukemic cells and resistance to apoptosis. Patients with t(9;22)-positive ALL have a higher risk of relapse and poorer response to treatment compared to those without this cytogenetic abnormality.

Therefore, in this case, the presence of t(9;22)-positive acute T cell lymphoblastic leukemia indicates a poor prognosis for the patient.",
"A 45-year-old homeless man comes to the emergency department because of progressive neck pain for 3 days. He also reports headaches and numbness in both hands. Over the past 4 months, he has had intermittent lower back pain after waking up. The back pain improves with movement. He also has recurrent episodes of gout in the metatarsophalangeal joint of his right big toe. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years and drinks four beers daily. The patient is a known user of intravenous heroin. He appears acutely ill. His temperature is 39°C (102.2°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 140/85 mm Hg. There are several track marks on both forearms. Examination of the neck shows warmth, erythema, and limited range of motion. Gentle palpation over the midcervical spinal processes causes severe pain. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 11 g/dL
Leukocyte count 14,200/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 77%
Eosinophils 1%
Lymphocytes 20%
Monocytes 2%
Platelet count 278,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 54 mm/h
Blood cultures are pending. An x-ray of the cervical spine shows no abnormalities. An MRI of the spine shows signs of inflammation. A bone biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Lumbar puncture
(B): Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy
(C): Surgical debridement
(D): Oral indomethacin therapy
(E): Bone scintigraphy
""
",Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is osteomyelitis, which is an infection of the bone. The patient's history of intravenous drug use, track marks, and symptoms of neck pain, fever, and limited range of motion are consistent with this diagnosis. The MRI findings of spinal inflammation and the bone biopsy confirming the diagnosis further support this.

Intravenous ciprofloxacin and vancomycin therapy is the most appropriate next step in management. Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that covers a broad spectrum of bacteria, including gram-negative organisms commonly associated with osteomyelitis. Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that covers gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is a common pathogen in intravenous drug users. The combination of these two antibiotics provides coverage for a wide range of potential pathogens.

Lumbar puncture (option A) is not indicated in this patient as there are no signs or symptoms of meningitis or central nervous system involvement.

Surgical debridement (option C) may be necessary in some cases of osteomyelitis, but it is not the initial step in management. Antibiotic therapy is typically initiated first, and surgical intervention may be considered if there is no improvement or if there are complications.

Oral indomethacin therapy (option D) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that may be used to treat gout, but it is not the appropriate treatment for osteomyelitis.

Bone scintigraphy (option E) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that can be used to detect areas of increased bone turnover, but it is not necessary in this patient as the diagnosis has already been confirmed with a bone biopsy.",
"A 1-month-old girl is brought to the emergency department with persistent vomiting, dehydration, and irritability. Over the past week, she has been projectile vomiting after most feedings. Initially, the vomiting would occur just once or twice a day, but now it occurs after every feed. However, her appetite hasn’t decreased, and she seeks milk right after each episode of vomiting. She was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery and is breastfed exclusively. On physical exam, the vital signs include: temperature 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg, respiratory rate 28/min, and heart rate 150/min. On examination, she appears to be mildly dehydrated, listless, and irritable. Her abdomen is soft and nontender with a palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region. Which of the following acid-base disturbances is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Respiratory alkalosis
(B): Metabolic acidosis
(C): Metabolic alkalosis
(D): Respiratory acidosis
(E): Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis
",Metabolic alkalosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Metabolic alkalosis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with pyloric stenosis, which is a condition characterized by hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the pyloric muscle, leading to gastric outlet obstruction. The persistent vomiting, projectile nature of the vomiting, and the palpable olive-shaped mass in the epigastric region are all classic findings of pyloric stenosis.

In pyloric stenosis, the repeated vomiting leads to loss of gastric acid and chloride, resulting in a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. This is because the loss of gastric acid leads to a decrease in hydrogen ions (H+) in the body, causing alkalosis. Additionally, the loss of chloride ions (Cl-) leads to a decrease in the anion gap, further contributing to the metabolic alkalosis.

The other options are not associated with pyloric stenosis. Respiratory alkalosis (option A) is characterized by a decrease in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood, which is not seen in this patient. Metabolic acidosis (option B) is characterized by a decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels in the blood, which is not seen in this patient. Respiratory acidosis (option D) is characterized by an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the blood, which is not seen in this patient. Mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (option E) is not consistent with the patient's presentation of metabolic alkalosis.

Therefore, the most likely acid-base disturbance associated with this patient's condition is metabolic alkalosis.",
"A 10-year-old girl is brought to a clinic by her parents after 1 week of difficulty breathing, dry cough, and low-grade fevers. She has also developed shallow erythematous ulcers inside of her mouth. There is no history of chills, rigors, or headaches. Her appetite has decreased. The girl has been HIV-positive since birth and is being treated with HAART. Her baseline viral load is <50/mL. On general examination, the girl appears ill. Diffuse inspiratory crackles are heard on chest auscultation with normal heart sounds. No lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly is noted on physical examination. A blood sample is drawn, which shows a CD4 count of 100/mm3 and a viral load of 25,050/mL. What is the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy?
Options:
(A): Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity
(B): gag gene mutation
(C): env gene mutation
(D): pol gene mutation
(E): Decreased viral replication
",pol gene mutation,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): pol gene mutation.

The lack of responsiveness to therapy in this case is most likely due to a pol gene mutation. The pol gene encodes for the viral enzymes reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease, which are essential for viral replication. Mutations in the pol gene can lead to drug resistance, making the virus less susceptible to the antiretroviral drugs used in HAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy).

In this case, the patient has a baseline viral load of <50/mL, indicating that the antiretroviral therapy was initially effective in suppressing viral replication. However, the subsequent increase in viral load to 25,050/mL suggests that the virus has developed resistance to the drugs. This is further supported by the low CD4 count of 100/mm3, indicating severe immune suppression despite treatment.

The other options are less likely to be responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy in this case. Ineffective CD8 cytotoxicity (option A) would result in impaired immune response against the virus, but it would not explain the increase in viral load. Gag gene mutation (option B) and env gene mutation (option C) may affect viral replication and immune response, but they are less commonly associated with drug resistance. Decreased viral replication (option E) is unlikely given the increase in viral load.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for the lack of responsiveness to therapy in this case is a pol gene mutation leading to drug resistance.",
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department with confusion. The patient lives in a nursing home and has Alzheimer dementia at baseline. His nurse noticed that he was more confused than usual and was somnolent for the past 12 hours. The patient’s nurse also noticed that he was soiling his diapers more frequently with copious amounts of urine. The patient has lost 15 pounds since his last physician appointment 3 weeks ago. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL
PTH: 8 pg/mL

The patient is referred to another physician for a more thorough workup including laboratory work and CT imaging. Which of the following is the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient’s acute symptoms?
Options:
(A): Alendronate
(B): Calcitonin
(C): Furosemide
(D): IV fluids
(E): Teriparatide
",Alendronate,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Alendronate.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory values, the most likely cause of his acute symptoms is hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause confusion, somnolence, increased urine output, and weight loss. The patient's elevated calcium level (Ca2+: 12.2 mg/dL) supports this diagnosis.

Alendronate is a bisphosphonate medication that is commonly used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. It works by inhibiting bone resorption and reducing calcium release from the bones. In this patient, long-term prophylaxis with alendronate can help prevent further episodes of hypercalcemia by reducing the release of calcium from the bones.

Calcitonin is another medication that can be used to lower calcium levels in the short term, but it is not the best long-term prophylaxis option. Furosemide is a diuretic that can help increase urine output and lower calcium levels, but it is not the best long-term option either. IV fluids can be used to rehydrate the patient and correct any electrolyte imbalances, but it is not a specific treatment for hypercalcemia. Teriparatide is a medication used for the treatment of osteoporosis, but it is not indicated for the prevention of hypercalcemia.

Therefore, the best long-term prophylaxis for the cause of this patient's acute symptoms is alendronate.",
"A 68-year-old woman is referred to the outpatient psychiatry clinic from the medical clinic. The patient is being treated for urge incontinence but is being referred for psychiatric evaluation to help with some of her old avoidance behavior. For the 3 months that she had her urinary symptoms, she avoided places like long lines and long train rides. Even after being successfully treated for her urinary condition, she continues to show restricted social interaction. Which of the following is a true statement regarding the patient's condition?
Options:
(A): She fears not being able to escape similar situations.
(B): Her symptoms need to last for at least 1 month.
(C): She requires only one fear or avoidance situation to meet criteria for this condition.
(D): Patients may have accompanying social phobia.
(E): The condition always occurs in the context of panic disorder.
",She fears not being able to escape similar situations.,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): She fears not being able to escape similar situations.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's avoidance behavior of places like long lines and long train rides suggests agoraphobia. Agoraphobia is characterized by a fear or avoidance of situations where escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms. In this case, the patient's fear of not being able to escape similar situations aligns with the criteria for agoraphobia. 

Option (B) is incorrect because the symptoms do not need to last for at least 1 month. The duration of symptoms is not specified in the information provided.

Option (C) is incorrect because agoraphobia typically involves multiple fear or avoidance situations, not just one.

Option (D) is correct. Patients with agoraphobia may have accompanying social phobia. In this case, the patient's restricted social interaction after being successfully treated for her urinary condition suggests the presence of social phobia.

Option (E) is incorrect because agoraphobia does not always occur in the context of panic disorder. While panic disorder and agoraphobia can coexist, they are separate conditions and can occur independently of each other.",
"A 55-year-old male presents to the emergency department with dyspnea and palpitations. He does not smoke cigarettes or consume alcohol, and past medical history is insignificant. Blood pressure is 115/75 mmHG and heart rate is 125/min. Heart rhythm is irregularly irregular. After initial treatment with IV digoxin the patient's heart rate drops to 85/min and remains irregular. Which of the following best explains the effect of digoxin in this patient?
Options:
(A): Blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors
(B): Calcium channel blockade
(C): Blockade of Na-K-ATPase on cardiac myocytes
(D): Vagal stimulation
(E): Increased ventricular contractility
",Vagal stimulation,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Vagal stimulation.

Explanation:
Digoxin is a medication that is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation, which is characterized by an irregularly irregular heart rhythm. Digoxin works by increasing vagal tone, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Vagal stimulation slows down the electrical conduction in the heart, resulting in a slower heart rate. In this case, the patient's heart rate dropped from 125/min to 85/min after receiving IV digoxin, indicating the effect of vagal stimulation. The irregularity of the heart rhythm is likely due to the underlying atrial fibrillation, which digoxin does not correct but helps control the heart rate.",
"Public health researchers are reviewing data from an outbreak of hepatitis A that was traced to contaminated produce from a popular restaurant. A case series investigation with prospective and retrospective follow-up found that 500 individuals dined at the restaurant during the week of study. The incidence of hepatitis A infection was found to be 25%, and the total number of deaths recorded among the incident cases was 5 individuals. What was the case-fatality rate for the hepatitis A outbreak?
Options:
(A): 4%
(B): 5%
(C): 10%
(D): 20%
(E): 25%
",4%,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) 4%.

The case-fatality rate is calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of incident cases and multiplying by 100. In this case, there were 5 deaths among the incident cases, which were 25% of the 500 individuals who dined at the restaurant. 

So, the number of incident cases is 500 * 0.25 = 125.

The case-fatality rate is (5/125) * 100 = 4%.",
"A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance after being involved in a motor vehicle collision. He was driving a motorcycle and collided with a bus. The EMT personnel found the patient alert with anterograde amnesia for the several minutes preceding the accident. Vital signs are within normal limits. On physical examination, the patient is drowsy but follows commands. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. The remainder of the initial examination is unremarkable. While the patient is being transferred to observation, his level of consciousness acutely declines. Repeat vital signs are significant for a blood pressure of 190/110 mm Hg. Ophthalmic examination now shows a fixed and dilated left pupil with no pupillary light reflex. A noncontrast CT of the head is performed and is shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Tearing of the middle meningeal artery
(B): Dural arteriovenous fistula
(C): Tearing of bridging veins
(D): Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm
(E): Arteriovenous malformation
",Tearing of the middle meningeal artery,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Tearing of the middle meningeal artery.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and the findings on the CT scan, the most likely etiology of this patient's condition is tearing of the middle meningeal artery, leading to an epidural hematoma. 

The patient's initial presentation with anterograde amnesia and normal vital signs suggests a mild traumatic brain injury. However, the acute decline in level of consciousness, elevated blood pressure, and the presence of a fixed and dilated pupil with no pupillary light reflex indicate a significant neurological deterioration.

The CT scan shows a biconvex, lens-shaped hematoma that is characteristic of an epidural hematoma. This type of hematoma is typically caused by tearing of the middle meningeal artery, which is a branch of the maxillary artery. The high-pressure arterial bleeding leads to the accumulation of blood between the dura mater and the skull, resulting in compression of the brain.

Dural arteriovenous fistula (B), tearing of bridging veins (C), Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysm (D), and arteriovenous malformation (E) are not consistent with the clinical presentation and findings on the CT scan. These conditions are not typically associated with the acute decline in consciousness and the presence of a fixed and dilated pupil.",
"A 42-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow-up visit. He has type 1 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes insulin. He complains of frequent episodes of waking up in the middle of his sleep. When he wakes up, he feels excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness. His morning blood glucose is high on repeated measurement. Which of the following is the optimal intervention for this patient condition?
Options:
(A): Reassurance
(B): Adding diazepam
(C): Adding pramlintide
(D): Increasing daily insulin dose
(E): Reducing daily insulin dose
",Reducing daily insulin dose,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Reducing daily insulin dose.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of waking up in the middle of the sleep with excessive sweating, hand tremors, and weakness are suggestive of nocturnal hypoglycemia, which is a common complication in patients with type 1 diabetes who take insulin. Nocturnal hypoglycemia occurs when the blood glucose levels drop too low during sleep.

Reducing the daily insulin dose would be the optimal intervention for this patient because it would help prevent episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia. By reducing the insulin dose, the patient's blood glucose levels would be less likely to drop too low during sleep, thus reducing the symptoms of waking up in the middle of the night.

Reassurance (option A) is not the optimal intervention because the patient's symptoms are indicative of a medical issue that needs to be addressed.

Adding diazepam (option B) is not the optimal intervention because diazepam is a medication used to treat anxiety and seizures, and it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Adding pramlintide (option C) is not the optimal intervention because pramlintide is a medication used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes, but it would not specifically address the issue of nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Increasing the daily insulin dose (option D) would not be the optimal intervention because it would increase the risk of hypoglycemia, exacerbating the patient's symptoms.",
"A researcher conducts multiple experiments to establish an infection and disease model for Clostridium perfringens in chickens. To ensure that all instruments are free of the pathogenic organism, he uses a disinfectant that oxidizes and denatures proteins. Which of the following disinfectants did the researcher most likely use?
Options:
(A): Chlorine dioxide
(B): Isopropyl alcohol
(C): Phenol
(D): Povidone-iodine
(E): Benzalkonium chloride
",Chlorine dioxide,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Chlorine dioxide.

The researcher most likely used chlorine dioxide as the disinfectant. Chlorine dioxide is known to oxidize and denature proteins, making it an effective disinfectant against pathogens like Clostridium perfringens. It is commonly used for disinfection purposes due to its strong oxidizing properties. Chlorine dioxide has been used in various applications, including fumigation and bleaching processes. In the context of the researcher's experiments, it would be an appropriate choice to ensure that all instruments are free of the pathogenic organism.",
"A 23-year-old woman visits her obstetrician for an antenatal appointment. She is at the 24th week of gestation. She has had type 1 diabetes mellitus for 5 years and is on insulin. She also has mitral stenosis, for which she has been advised to undergo a balloon valvotomy. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure is 120/60 mm Hg, and pulse is 90/minute. Her random blood glucose is 220 mg/dL and HbA1C is 8.5%. She wants to discuss possible complications concerning her pregnancy. Which of the following cardiac complications is her infant at high risk for?
Options:
(A): Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy
(B): Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(C): Tetralogy of Fallot
(D): Ebstein anomaly
(E): Mitral valve prolapse
",Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Explanation:
Infants of mothers with diabetes are at increased risk for transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In this condition, there is thickening of the interventricular septum (IVS) with reduction in the size of the ventricular chambers, potentially leading to obstruction of left ventricular outflow. This can be aggravated by anterior systolic motion of the mitral valve. While most infants are asymptomatic, some may present with respiratory distress or signs of poor cardiac output or heart failure. The chest radiograph may show cardiomegaly, but echocardiography is the best method to detect hypertrophy. 

Transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a reversible condition that resolves as plasma insulin concentrations normalize. Symptomatic infants typically recover after two to three weeks of supportive care, and echocardiographic findings resolve within 6 to 12 months. Therefore, infants of mothers with diabetes, like the patient in this case, are at high risk for transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.",
"A 63-year-old man presents to the physician with a complaint of back pain for the past 2 months. The pain is present throughout the day, and even at night when he lies down. He also complains of difficulty walking upstairs and says he recently started to wear adult diapers because he seems to have difficulty controlling his bowel movements. His vital signs are within normal limits. The neurological examination revealed bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense. The rectal examination revealed a hard nodular mass and a weak rectal sphincter tone. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his symptoms?
Options:
(A): Syringomyelia
(B): Spinal metastasis
(C): Herniated disc
(D): Epidural abscess
(E): Spinal hematoma
",Spinal metastasis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Spinal metastasis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of back pain, difficulty walking upstairs, and difficulty controlling bowel movements, along with the findings on neurological examination of bilateral lower limb weakness, diminished temperature sensation, and decreased vibratory sense, are indicative of a spinal cord compression syndrome. The rectal examination revealing a hard nodular mass and weak rectal sphincter tone further supports this diagnosis.

Spinal metastasis refers to the spread of cancer to the spine from a primary tumor elsewhere in the body. It is a common cause of spinal cord compression and can lead to the symptoms described in the patient. The presence of a hard nodular mass on rectal examination suggests the possibility of a metastatic tumor in the spine.

Other options such as syringomyelia, herniated disc, epidural abscess, and spinal hematoma are less likely to cause the combination of symptoms and findings described in the patient. Syringomyelia is a condition characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord, but it does not typically present with the neurological findings seen in this patient. Herniated disc, epidural abscess, and spinal hematoma may cause back pain and neurological symptoms, but they are less likely to cause the specific combination of symptoms and findings described in this case.",
"An 18-year-old college student presents to the student health clinic complaining of excessive sleepiness. He first noticed the daytime sleepiness about a year ago but reports that it significantly worsened once he started college. He reports that he goes to bed around 9 p.m. and wakes up for class at 8 a.m.. He naps between classes for a total of 4 hours during the day. Despite this, he wakes up feeling exhausted. He easily falls asleep during class and while studying. This has started to affect both his academics and his social life. On weekends, he can sleep up to 20 hours a day. He reports 2 recent episodes of sudden generalized body weakness along with ptosis and difficulty speaking that occurred after he became angry. Each episode lasted about 10 seconds, but he says he felt back to normal within 15 minutes without any persistent deficits. His Epworth Sleepiness Scale score is 17. Which of the following is the best next step in therapy?
Options:
(A): Clomipramine
(B): Dextroamphetamine
(C): Methylpenidate
(D): Modafinil
(E): Sleep deprivation
",Modafinil,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Modafinil.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's excessive sleepiness, difficulty staying awake during the day, and episodes of sudden generalized body weakness along with ptosis and difficulty speaking are consistent with a diagnosis of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, sudden loss of muscle tone (cataplexy), sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and disrupted nighttime sleep.

The best next step in therapy for this patient is to prescribe modafinil. Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent that is commonly used to treat excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. It works by increasing wakefulness and reducing sleepiness. The recommended dose of modafinil is 200-400 mg per day, given as a single dose in the morning.

Clomipramine (choice A) is an antidepressant that can be used to treat cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy. However, it is not the best next step in therapy for this patient because his main complaint is excessive sleepiness, not cataplexy.

Dextroamphetamine (choice B) and methylphenidate (choice C) are stimulant medications that can also be used to treat excessive sleepiness in patients with narcolepsy. However, modafinil is generally preferred over these medications due to its lower risk of abuse and addiction.

Sleep deprivation (choice E) is not a recommended treatment for narcolepsy. In fact, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and getting enough sleep at night is important for managing narcolepsy symptoms.

In summary, the best next step in therapy for this patient with excessive sleepiness and possible narcolepsy is to prescribe modafinil.",
"A 63-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease complains of feeling lightheaded after her hemodialysis sessions for the past month. She worries she might eventually lose her balance and fall. She has had diabetes mellitus for 22 years. Her medications include folic acid, vitamin B12, amlodipine, and erythropoietin. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormal findings. Laboratory studies after hemodialysis show a Hb of 10.5 mg/dL, a blood sugar of 189 mg/dL, and a hemoglobin A1C of 7.1%. To reduce the likelihood of falls, the most appropriate management is which of the following?
Options:
(A): Cooling the dialysate
(B): Eating heavier meals during dialysis
(C): Increasing salt intake
(D): Increasing ultrafiltration
(E): Steroid administration
",Cooling the dialysate,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Cooling the dialysate.

Explanation:
The patient in this case is experiencing lightheadedness after hemodialysis sessions, which can be a result of hypotension. The blood pressure measurements of 135/80 mm Hg when lying down before dialysis and 110/55 mm Hg when seated after hemodialysis indicate a significant drop in blood pressure during the dialysis session. This drop in blood pressure can lead to lightheadedness and increase the risk of falls.

Cooling the dialysate can help to reduce the likelihood of hypotension during hemodialysis. By lowering the temperature of the dialysate, the blood vessels in the body constrict, which helps to maintain blood pressure. This can prevent the significant drop in blood pressure that occurs during dialysis and reduce the risk of lightheadedness and falls.

Eating heavier meals during dialysis (B) is not the most appropriate management in this case. While maintaining adequate nutrition is important for patients on dialysis, eating heavier meals during dialysis is unlikely to have a significant impact on blood pressure or reduce the risk of falls.

Increasing salt intake (C) may help to increase blood volume and blood pressure, but it is not the most appropriate management in this case. Increasing salt intake can lead to fluid overload and worsen hypertension, which is a common complication in patients with end-stage renal disease.

Increasing ultrafiltration (D) is not the most appropriate management in this case. Ultrafiltration is the process of removing excess fluid during dialysis. Increasing ultrafiltration can further decrease blood volume and blood pressure, which can exacerbate the lightheadedness and increase the risk of falls.

Steroid administration (E) is not the most appropriate management in this case. Steroids are not indicated for the treatment of lightheadedness or falls in patients on dialysis. Steroids may have other indications in certain medical conditions, but they are not the most appropriate management for the symptoms described in this case.",
"A 34-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with a fever. She developed worsening malaise and diaphoresis over the past 48 hours. Her maximum temperature was 102°F (38.9°C) taken the night before presentation. Her past medical history is notable for major depressive disorder, obesity, fibromyalgia, and severe tension headaches. She previously took paroxetine for a 2-month trial but switched to citalopram 6 months ago as she did not feel like paroxetine was adequately helping her symptoms. Her mood has been stable on her current dose of citalopram. She takes ibuprofen for her headaches but previously borrowed a friend’s headache medication when her headaches became very severe. Of note, she has been trying to lose weight and recently started taking an amino acid supplement at the suggestion of her nephew who is a nutritionist. She is also trying out a new low-carbohydrate diet. She works as a nurse at a local primary care clinic. Her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 144/80 mmHg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 22/min. She is diaphoretic and shivering. Patellar and brachioradialis reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Tone is increased in her bilateral upper and lower extremities. Rapid dorsiflexion of her right ankle elicits 3 beats of clonus. Pupils are equally round and reactive to light. A basic metabolic panel is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely inciting factor for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Decreased carbohydrate intake
(B): Increased tryptophan intake
(C): Medication change
(D): Surreptitious diuretic abuse
(E): Surreptitious opiate abuse
",Increased tryptophan intake,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Increased tryptophan intake.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with serotonin syndrome, which is most commonly caused by the use of serotonergic medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like citalopram. The patient's symptoms of fever, diaphoresis, shivering, and increased reflexes are all consistent with serotonin syndrome. Additionally, the increased tone in her extremities and clonus are signs of hyperreflexia, which is a characteristic finding in serotonin syndrome. The fact that her mood has been stable on citalopram suggests that the medication change is not the cause of her symptoms. The patient's low-carbohydrate diet and amino acid supplement are not likely to be the cause of her symptoms. Surreptitious diuretic abuse and surreptitious opiate abuse are not supported by the patient's history and are less likely to cause serotonin syndrome. Therefore, the most likely inciting factor for this patient's condition is the increased tryptophan intake from the amino acid supplement. Tryptophan is a precursor to serotonin, and increased intake can lead to excessive serotonin production and subsequent serotonin syndrome.",
"A 47-year-old man presents with hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath. He has had these symptoms before but did not seek treatment. His past medical history is not known as he is not typically followed by a doctor and is homeless. His temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 154/94 mmHg, pulse is 89/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 90% on room air. Physical examination is notable for crackles noted in the bases of the lungs bilaterally. Labs values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 140 mEq/L
Cl-: 103 mEq/L
K+: 5.8 mEq/L
HCO3-: 21 mEq/L
BUN: 33 mg/dL
Glucose: 129 mg/dL
Creatinine: 2.6 mg/dL

Urine:
Color: Amber
Protein: Positive
Blood: Positive

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Methylprednisolone
(B): Methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide
(C): Methylprednislone, IVIG, and cyclophosphamide
(D): Methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide
(E): Plasmapheresis and cyclophosphamide
","Methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide",Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Goodpasture syndrome, which is characterized by pulmonary hemorrhage and glomerulonephritis. The presence of hemoptysis, diffuse muscle pain, and shortness of breath, along with crackles on physical examination, suggests pulmonary involvement. The presence of proteinuria, hematuria, and RBC casts in the urine indicates glomerulonephritis.

The treatment of choice for Goodpasture syndrome is a combination of immunosuppressive therapy and plasmapheresis. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that helps to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation. Plasmapheresis is used to remove circulating antibodies and immune complexes from the blood. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive agent that helps to suppress the immune system and prevent further damage to the kidneys.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is a combination of methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide (option D). This treatment approach aims to control the immune response, remove circulating antibodies, and prevent further damage to the lungs and kidneys.",
"A 39-year-old woman presents with headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency. Her blood pressure is 160/100 mm Hg and pulse is 67/min. Blood tests reveal high blood glucose and low potassium level. Abdominal CT scan shows a well-circumscribed homogeneous mass in the left adrenal gland. The hormone excess responsible for her symptoms uses which of the following pathways to exert its action?
Options:
(A): Intracellular receptors
(B): Tyrosine kinase receptors
(C): cAMP pathway
(D): cGMP pathway
(E): JAK/STAT pathway
",Intracellular receptors,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Intracellular receptors.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings, it is likely that she has a hormone-secreting adrenal tumor, specifically a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors that arise from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla and can produce excess catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The symptoms of headaches, constipation, increased thirst, and increased urinary frequency are consistent with excess catecholamines. These hormones can bind to intracellular receptors, specifically alpha and beta adrenergic receptors, to exert their effects.

Intracellular receptors are located within the cytoplasm or nucleus of target cells. When a hormone binds to an intracellular receptor, it forms a hormone-receptor complex that can then enter the nucleus and directly affect gene transcription. This leads to changes in protein synthesis and cellular function.

In the case of excess catecholamines, binding to intracellular receptors can lead to increased blood pressure (via vasoconstriction), increased heart rate, increased blood glucose levels (via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis), and decreased potassium levels (via increased cellular uptake and renal excretion).

Therefore, the hormone excess responsible for the patient's symptoms uses intracellular receptors to exert its action.",
"A 55-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a headache. He states that this is the worst headache he has ever had and that his symptoms have not been improving. The patient complains of pain in his jaw that is worse when he chews. He has a past medical history of insomnia and is currently taking alprazolam. His temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 157/98 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for tenderness over the patient's scalp, jaw, and temporal area. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): CT head
(B): Ibuprofen
(C): IV steroids
(D): Lumbar puncture
(E): Temporal artery biopsy
",IV steroids,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) IV steroids.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis. This is a vasculitis that primarily affects medium and large arteries, most commonly the temporal arteries. It typically occurs in individuals over the age of 50 and is more common in women. The classic symptoms include new-onset headache, jaw claudication (pain in the jaw with chewing), and tenderness over the temporal artery. Other symptoms may include visual disturbances, scalp tenderness, and constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

Given the patient's age, symptoms, and physical exam findings, temporal arteritis is a likely diagnosis. The next step in management is to initiate treatment with high-dose intravenous (IV) steroids, such as methylprednisolone. This is because temporal arteritis is a medical emergency that can lead to permanent vision loss if not promptly treated. The steroids help to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the affected arteries.

A CT head (option A) may be considered if there are concerns for other causes of the headache, such as intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are highly suggestive of temporal arteritis, making IV steroids the more appropriate next step.

Ibuprofen (option B) is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that may provide symptomatic relief for headaches. However, it does not address the underlying inflammation and is not the best next step in management for temporal arteritis.

Lumbar puncture (option D) is not indicated in the evaluation of temporal arteritis. It may be considered in certain cases to evaluate for other causes of headache, such as meningitis or subarachnoid hemorrhage, but it is not the best next step in this scenario.

Temporal artery biopsy (option E) is the gold standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis. However, it is not the best next step in management. Treatment with IV steroids should be initiated promptly to prevent vision loss, and temporal artery biopsy can be performed later to confirm the diagnosis.",
"A 34-year-old man with acute lymphocytic leukemia presents for follow-up in the oncology clinic after his second cycle of chemotherapy. In addition to intermittent nausea, he has mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand. With his affected hand, he is able to grip, but occasionally drops small objects. His oncologist tells him that one of his chemotherapy agents likely caused his neuropathy given its strong association with neurotoxicity. He was recently treated with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, dexamethasone, and dasatinib. The culprit medication works by which of the following mechanisms of action?
Options:
(A): Covalently X-links DNA
(B): Blocks microtubule formation
(C): Intercalates between DNA
(D): Modifies DNA transcription and protein synthesis
(E): Blocks tyrosine kinase
",Blocks microtubule formation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Blocks microtubule formation.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of mild weakness, tingling, and numbness in his left hand are consistent with peripheral neuropathy, which is a known side effect of certain chemotherapy agents. Vincristine, one of the chemotherapy agents the patient received, is strongly associated with neurotoxicity. Vincristine works by blocking microtubule formation.

Microtubules are important structures involved in cell division, intracellular transport, and maintenance of cell shape. Vincristine disrupts microtubule formation by binding to tubulin, a protein that makes up microtubules, and preventing its polymerization into microtubules. This disruption of microtubule formation can lead to impaired axonal transport and damage to peripheral nerves, resulting in peripheral neuropathy.

Therefore, the culprit medication in this case, vincristine, works by blocking microtubule formation.",
"A 1-day-old infant is in the neonatal intensive care unit due to respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia. The mother is a healthy 32-year-old woman who did not have regular prenatal exams. On physical examination, you notice low-set ears and retrognathia with abnormal extremity development. Which of the following abnormalities is associated with the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Hepatosplenomegaly
(B): Macroorchidism
(C): Posterior urethral valves
(D): Rocker bottom feet
(E): Duodenal atresia
",Posterior urethral valves,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Posterior urethral valves.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the question, including low-set ears, retrognathia (receding chin), and abnormal extremity development, are consistent with a diagnosis of Potter sequence. Potter sequence is a constellation of physical findings that result from oligohydramnios (reduced amniotic fluid) in utero. Oligohydramnios can occur when there is an obstruction of the fetal urinary tract, such as with posterior urethral valves.

Posterior urethral valves are a congenital abnormality that occurs only in males. It is characterized by abnormal folds of tissue in the posterior urethra, leading to obstruction of urine flow. This obstruction can cause a backflow of urine into the bladder and kidneys, leading to dilatation of the urinary tract and subsequent oligohydramnios. The oligohydramnios then leads to compression of the developing fetus, resulting in the physical findings seen in Potter sequence.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms, including respiratory failure from pulmonary hypoplasia, low-set ears, retrognathia, and abnormal extremity development, is posterior urethral valves.",
"A 47-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer who is undergoing chemotherapy comes to the physician for a follow-up exam. She reports extreme fatigue since beginning her chemotherapy regimen. Her pulse is 98/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 132/84 mm Hg. Her hemoglobin is 10.4 g/dL, leukocyte count is 800/mm3 with 5% monocytes, and platelet count is 50,000/mm3. The patient is started on a new medication. One week later, serum studies show a hemoglobin of 10.6 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 2,000/mm3 with 2% monocytes, and a platelet count of 56,000/mm3. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these findings?
Options:
(A): Aldesleukin
(B): Interferon beta
(C): Filgrastim
(D): Romiplostim
(E): Sargramostim
",Filgrastim,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Filgrastim.

Filgrastim is a medication that stimulates the production of white blood cells, specifically neutrophils. It is commonly used in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy to prevent or treat neutropenia, which is a decrease in the number of neutrophils. Neutropenia can increase the risk of infections.

In this case, the patient is undergoing chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer and is experiencing extreme fatigue. The laboratory findings show a low leukocyte count (800/mm3) and a low platelet count (50,000/mm3), indicating neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. One week after starting the new medication, the leukocyte count increases to 2,000/mm3 and the platelet count increases to 56,000/mm3.

These findings suggest that the medication, filgrastim, is effectively stimulating the production of white blood cells and platelets, leading to an improvement in the patient's blood counts. Therefore, filgrastim is the most likely cause of these findings.",
"A male newborn born at 27 weeks' gestation is evaluated for rapid breathing and hypoxia shortly after birth. His mother had no prenatal care. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds, intercostal retractions, and nasal flaring. An x-ray of the chest shows low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. He is started on nasal continuous positive airway pressure. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Bilateral pleural effusions on lung ultrasound
(B): Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture
(C): Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy
(D): Meconium-stained fluid on deep suctioning
(E): Patent ductus arteriosus on echocardiography
",Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Hyaline membranes lining the alveoli on lung biopsy.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of rapid breathing, hypoxia, and abnormal chest x-ray findings in a premature newborn is consistent with the diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). RDS is a common respiratory complication in premature infants, especially those born before 28 weeks' gestation. It is caused by a deficiency of surfactant, a substance that helps keep the alveoli open and prevents them from collapsing.

The presence of low lung volumes, air bronchograms, and diffuse ground-glass opacities on the chest x-ray are characteristic findings of RDS. These findings indicate that the alveoli are collapsed and filled with fluid, leading to impaired gas exchange and hypoxia.

To confirm the diagnosis of RDS and assess the severity of the disease, a lung biopsy may be performed. The most likely finding on lung biopsy in this patient would be the presence of hyaline membranes lining the alveoli. Hyaline membranes are composed of fibrin, cellular debris, and inflammatory cells, and they form as a result of the inflammatory response to the collapsed alveoli. The presence of hyaline membranes confirms the diagnosis of RDS.

Bilateral pleural effusions (option A) are not typically seen in RDS and would be an atypical finding. Corkscrew-shaped organisms on umbilical cord culture (option B) are suggestive of a bacterial infection, which is not the primary cause of the patient's symptoms. Meconium-stained fluid (option D) is a sign of fetal distress but is not specific to RDS. Patent ductus arteriosus (option E) is a common cardiac complication in premature infants but would not explain the patient's respiratory symptoms and abnormal chest x-ray findings.",
"A 38-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of three 1-hour episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant. During these episodes, she has had nausea and vomiting. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, or hematuria and is asymptomatic between episodes. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Seven years ago, she underwent resection of the terminal ileum because of severe Crohn's disease. She is 155 cm (5 ft 2 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (175 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/95 mm Hg. There is mild scleral icterus. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. The abdomen is soft, and there is tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound. Bowel sounds are normal. The stool is brown, and test for occult blood is negative. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL

Abdominal ultrasonography shows a normal liver, a common bile duct caliber of 10 mm (normal < 6 mm) and a gallbladder with multiple gallstones and no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?""
Options:
(A): Acute hepatitis A
(B): Choledocholithiasis
(C): Autoimmune hepatitis
(D): Cholecystitis
(E): Pancreatitis
""
",Choledocholithiasis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Choledocholithiasis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with choledocholithiasis, which is the presence of gallstones in the common bile duct. The patient has a history of gallstones (as evidenced by the multiple gallstones seen on abdominal ultrasonography) and is now experiencing episodes of severe, sharp, penetrating abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant, along with nausea and vomiting. These symptoms are characteristic of biliary colic, which occurs when a gallstone temporarily obstructs the cystic duct or common bile duct, leading to increased pressure in the biliary tree. The tenderness to palpation of the right upper quadrant without guarding or rebound is also consistent with biliary colic. The elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT suggest biliary obstruction and hepatocellular injury, which can occur with choledocholithiasis. The elevated total bilirubin level further supports the diagnosis, as it indicates impaired bile flow. The common bile duct dilation seen on abdominal ultrasonography is another finding consistent with choledocholithiasis. Acute hepatitis A would typically present with jaundice, but the patient's scleral icterus is mild and likely secondary to the biliary obstruction. Autoimmune hepatitis would not cause gallstones or biliary obstruction. Cholecystitis would typically present with localized tenderness and guarding or rebound on examination, which are not present in this patient. Pancreatitis would typically present with epigastric pain radiating to the back, and the patient's pain is localized to the right upper quadrant.",
"A 31-year-old G1-P0 woman at 28-weeks gestation presents with shortness of breath and nonspecific right-sided chest pain that is worse with inspiration. She works as a graduate student at the local university, and she informs you that she recently returned to the west coast from a trip to New York for an Economics conference. Her medical history is positive only for frequent bouts of sinusitis. She currently denies any smoking, drinks a glass of red wine/day, and she denies any past illicit drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 126/74 mm Hg, heart rate 87/min, and respiratory rate 23/min. Her physical examination shows decreased air movement throughout the right lung but otherwise clear lungs on auscultation, grade 2/6 holosystolic murmur, and a gravid uterus without acute findings. On physical examination, she is afebrile, tachycardic to 121/min, normotensive, and demonstrates an O2 saturation of 92%. Which of the following is the best next step in the evaluation of the most likely diagnosis for this patient?
Options:
(A): D-dimer
(B): ECG
(C): Chest radiography
(D): V/Q scan
(E): CT pulmonary angiogram
",V/Q scan,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) V/Q scan.

Explanation:
This patient presents with shortness of breath, right-sided chest pain, and decreased air movement throughout the right lung. These findings, along with the patient's recent travel history and tachycardia, raise suspicion for a pulmonary embolism (PE). 

A V/Q scan (ventilation/perfusion scan) is the best next step in the evaluation of this patient. A V/Q scan is a nuclear medicine test that evaluates the ventilation (airflow) and perfusion (blood flow) in the lungs. It can help identify areas of the lung that are not receiving adequate blood flow, which may indicate a PE. 

A D-dimer test is a blood test that measures a substance released when a blood clot breaks down. While a negative D-dimer can help rule out a PE in low-risk patients, this patient's presentation and risk factors make a PE more likely, so a D-dimer alone would not be sufficient to rule out a PE in this case.

An ECG (electrocardiogram) is a useful tool for evaluating cardiac function, but it is not specific for diagnosing a PE.

Chest radiography (option C) may show nonspecific findings such as atelectasis or pleural effusion, but it is not the best initial test for evaluating a suspected PE.

A CT pulmonary angiogram (option E) is a highly sensitive and specific test for diagnosing a PE, but it involves radiation exposure and contrast dye, which may be contraindicated in pregnant patients. Therefore, a V/Q scan is preferred as the initial test in this pregnant patient.

In summary, a V/Q scan is the best next step in the evaluation of this patient with suspected PE, considering her presentation, risk factors, and pregnancy status.",
"An otherwise healthy 29-year-old man presents to his family physician with a slowly growing left neck mass for the past 5 weeks. He denies fever or recent upper respiratory tract infections. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.7°F), the blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg, and the pulse are 82/min. On examination, a 4-cm (1.5 in), firm, non-tender mass is detected on the mid-left neck. Excisional biopsy of the mass reveals Hodgkin’s cells. The patient is referred to the oncology department and chemotherapy is started. After the first cycle of chemotherapy, the patient notices that his urine becomes red. The urine tests are positive for blood on further analysis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient condition?
Options:
(A): Vinblastine
(B): Bleomycin
(C): Cyclophosphamide
(D): Doxorubicin
(E): Etoposide
",Cyclophosphamide,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Cyclophosphamide.

Explanation:
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent commonly used in chemotherapy regimens for Hodgkin's lymphoma. One of the known side effects of cyclophosphamide is hemorrhagic cystitis, which can cause blood in the urine. Hemorrhagic cystitis occurs due to the toxic effects of cyclophosphamide on the bladder lining, leading to inflammation and bleeding. The red urine observed in this patient is consistent with hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cyclophosphamide. It is important to monitor patients receiving cyclophosphamide for this side effect and take appropriate measures to prevent and manage it.",
"An 18-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of lightheadedness and a feeling of dizziness. She has had nausea, occasional episodes of vomiting, myalgia, and a generalized rash for the past week. She also reports feeling lethargic. She has no shortness of breath. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears ill. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.3°F), pulse is 118/min, and blood pressure is 94/60 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. There is a widespread erythematous rash on the trunk and extremities with skin peeling on the palms and soles. Laboratory studies show:

Urinalysis shows no abnormalities. Further evaluation of this patient's history is most likely to reveal which of the following?""
Options:
(A): Recent treatment with sulfonamides
(B): Recent hiking trip
(C): Intravenous heroin abuse
(D): Exposure to a patient with mengingococcemia
(E): Currently menstruating
",Currently menstruating,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Currently menstruating.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including lightheadedness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, myalgia, and rash, along with the laboratory findings of leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes, are consistent with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that is most commonly associated with menstruating women who use high-absorbency tampons. The symptoms typically occur during or shortly after menstruation. TSS is caused by the release of exotoxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The toxins can cause a systemic inflammatory response, leading to multiorgan dysfunction. The widespread erythematous rash, along with skin peeling on the palms and soles, is a characteristic finding in TSS. The patient's history is most likely to reveal that she is currently menstruating, which would further support the diagnosis of TSS.",
"A 62-year-old man presents to the emergency department for evaluation of a low-grade fever, worsening fatigue, and mild intermittent abdominal pain that is not affected by eating. He reports that over the last 6 months he slept a lot more than usual and lost 14.9 kg (33 lbs) without trying to lose weight. He also complains of chest pain and shortness of breath that is worse when he is working and in the yard. There is no significant family history. His long-standing male partner passed away 2 years ago in a fatal car accident. His blood pressure is 145/75 mm Hg, the pulse is 90/min, the respiratory rate is 23/min, and the temperature is 38°C (100.5°F). On physical examination, he has pale mucous membranes, conjunctival hemorrhages, and petechiae on his lower extremities. There is a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border. His head bobs with each heartbeat. There are small, painless, red macules on both palms. His spleen is palpable 3 cm below the left costal margin. His laboratory results are shown below.
Hemoglobin 8.4 g/dL

Total iron-binding capacity 450 µg/dL
Colonoscopy with biopsy is later performed showing a neoplastic growth in the descending colon. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his cardiac findings?
Options:
(A): Viridans streptococci
(B): Treponema pallidum
(C): Malignant colonic neoplasm
(D): Collagen vascular disease
(E): Group D streptococci
",Group D streptococci,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Group D streptococci.

Explanation:
The patient's cardiac findings, including a new-onset high-pitched blowing diastolic murmur best heard over the right upper sternal border and a head bobbing with each heartbeat, are consistent with aortic regurgitation. Aortic regurgitation can be caused by infective endocarditis, which is commonly associated with Group D streptococci. The patient's history of weight loss, fatigue, and low-grade fever, along with the presence of conjunctival hemorrhages and petechiae, are suggestive of an underlying infection. Additionally, the patient's splenomegaly and the presence of small, painless, red macules on both palms (Osler nodes) are also consistent with infective endocarditis. The neoplastic growth in the descending colon is likely unrelated to the cardiac findings.",
"A 33-year-old woman presents to the clinic for follow-up of her AIDS treatment with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART). She is in good spirits and has been fully compliant with her medications and clinic visits. Other medications include prophylactic co-trimoxazole. Recent blood studies show the following:
Hemoglobin (Hb%)  11 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV)  80 fl
Reticulocyte count 0.5%
Erythrocyte count 2 x 106/mm3
Leucocyte count 700/mm3
Neutrophils 40%
Platelet count 20,000/mm3
Assays also show a decreased viral DNA and mRNA burden, as well as a significantly diminished viral load. To avoid modifying the effective anti-retroviral therapy, she is started on a ‘blood improving’ medication. Thirty minutes after the first dose, the patient develops difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, and vomiting. Her pulse rate is 120/min and the blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg. Which of the following medications was most likely administered to the patient?
Options:
(A): Filgrastim
(B): Interleukin 3
(C): Platelet-derived growth factor
(D): Sargramostim
(E): Thrombopoietin
",Sargramostim,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Sargramostim.

Explanation:
Sargramostim, also known as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), is a medication that stimulates the production of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. It is commonly used to treat low blood cell counts in patients with HIV infection.

In this case, the patient has a low platelet count (20,000/mm3), which is known as thrombocytopenia. Thrombocytopenia can be caused by HIV infection itself or as a side effect of certain medications, such as zidovudine-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART). To improve the patient's platelet count without modifying the effective ART, a ""blood improving"" medication is administered.

The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, severe muscle pain, and vomiting, along with a rapid pulse rate and low blood pressure, are consistent with an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur in response to certain medications.

Sargramostim has been associated with allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Therefore, it is the most likely medication that was administered to the patient, leading to her symptoms. It is important to recognize and manage anaphylaxis promptly, as it can be life-threatening.",
"A 77-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion and unusual behavior for 2 days. She has been mumbling to herself and wandering around the neighborhood. These symptoms are worse in the evenings and she has hardly slept at night. She has not been eating or drinking much for the past 6 days. She has hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. She was diagnosed with breast cancer 12 years ago and was treated with left-sided mastectomy. The patient is oriented to person but not to place or time. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 78/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 122/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a supple neck. Neurologic examination shows psychomotor agitation. Attention and concentration are impaired; she makes multiple errors while performing the serial sevens test. Her speech is disorganized. Her fingerstick blood glucose concentration is 122 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Perform lumbar puncture
(B): Check serum TSH level
(C): Check serum electrolytes
(D): Perform CT scan of the head
(E): Perform chest x-ray
",Check serum electrolytes,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Check serum electrolytes.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of confusion, unusual behavior, psychomotor agitation, impaired attention and concentration, disorganized speech, and sleep disturbance are consistent with delirium. Delirium is a common condition in older adults and can be caused by various factors, including electrolyte imbalances, infections, medication side effects, and metabolic disturbances. In this case, the patient's history of poor oral intake for the past 6 days raises concern for dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.

Checking serum electrolytes is the most appropriate next step in management because it can help identify any imbalances that may be contributing to the patient's delirium. Electrolyte abnormalities, such as hyponatremia or hypernatremia, can cause neurologic symptoms and cognitive impairment. Additionally, other laboratory tests, such as complete blood count and renal function tests, may also be ordered to further evaluate the patient's overall health status.

Performing a lumbar puncture (option A) would be indicated if there is suspicion of central nervous system infection, such as meningitis or encephalitis. However, there are no specific findings in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest an infectious etiology at this time.

Checking serum TSH level (option B) would be appropriate if there is suspicion of thyroid dysfunction, such as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. However, there are no specific findings in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest thyroid dysfunction as the cause of her symptoms.

Performing a CT scan of the head (option D) would be indicated if there is suspicion of structural brain abnormalities, such as a mass or hemorrhage. However, there are no specific findings in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest a need for immediate imaging.

Performing a chest x-ray (option E) would be indicated if there is suspicion of a respiratory infection or other pulmonary pathology. However, there are no specific findings in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest a respiratory etiology for her symptoms.",
"A 39-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fever, generalized fatigue, and chills for 1 week. She has been having dull right-side abdominal pain during this period. She has nausea. She has no history of travel outside the United States. She has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include insulin and an oral contraceptive. She appears ill. Her temperature is 40°C (104°F), pulse is 118/min, and blood pressure is 106/70 mm Hg. On examination, the liver is palpated 2–3 cm below the right costal margin and is tender.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Discontinue the oral contraceptive
(B): Obtain hepatoiminodiacetic acid scan
(C): Perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(D): Administer metronidazole
(E): Perform percutaneous drainage
""
","Perform percutaneous drainage
""",Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Perform percutaneous drainage.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is liver abscess. The patient has fever, chills, right-side abdominal pain, and a tender liver on examination. The laboratory findings show leukocytosis with a left shift (increased segmented neutrophils), which is consistent with an infectious process. The ultrasound image also supports the diagnosis of a liver abscess.

The next step in management for a liver abscess is percutaneous drainage. This is the most appropriate option because it allows for both diagnosis and treatment. Percutaneous drainage involves inserting a needle or catheter into the abscess cavity to drain the pus and relieve symptoms. It also allows for culture and sensitivity testing of the abscess fluid to guide antibiotic therapy.

Discontinuing the oral contraceptive (option A) is not necessary in this case as it is not the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Obtaining a hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan (option B) is not indicated in the management of a liver abscess. HIDA scans are used to evaluate the biliary system and are not helpful in diagnosing or managing liver abscesses.

Performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) (option C) is also not indicated in the management of a liver abscess. ERCP is used to evaluate and treat disorders of the biliary and pancreatic ducts, but it is not the appropriate next step in this case.

Administering metronidazole (option D) is a possible treatment option for liver abscess, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Percutaneous drainage should be performed first to both diagnose and treat the abscess.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with a liver abscess is to perform percutaneous drainage (option E).",
"A 57-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for follow-up of his diabetes. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 3 months ago and has been started on metformin and lifestyle modifications. The patient does not have any current complaints except for occasional numbness in both hands and feet. His HbA1C is 8.5% and serum glucose is 240 mg/dL. Which of the following is the best next step in this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Start basal-bolus insulin
(B): Continue metformin monotherapy
(C): Add a sulfonylurea
(D): Add an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor
(E): Add a thiazolidinedione
",Add a sulfonylurea,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Add a sulfonylurea.

Explanation:
In this patient with type 2 diabetes, the HbA1C level of 8.5% and serum glucose level of 240 mg/dL indicate poor glycemic control. The patient is already on metformin, which is the recommended initial therapy for type 2 diabetes. However, since the patient's glycemic control is not optimal, an additional medication should be added.

The best next step in this patient's condition is to add a sulfonylurea. Sulfonylureas are oral hypoglycemic agents that stimulate insulin secretion from the pancreas. They are effective in lowering blood glucose levels and can be used in combination with metformin to achieve better glycemic control.

Basal-bolus insulin therapy (option A) is typically reserved for patients with more severe or uncontrolled diabetes who require intensive insulin therapy. This patient's diabetes is relatively new and can be managed with oral medications at this time.

Continuing metformin monotherapy (option B) may not be sufficient to achieve the desired glycemic control in this patient. Adding another medication is necessary.

Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (option D) and thiazolidinediones (option E) are alternative options for managing type 2 diabetes, but they are not the best next step in this patient's condition. Sulfonylureas have a stronger evidence base for improving glycemic control and are a more appropriate choice in this case.",
"A 42-year-old chronic alcoholic man was admitted to the hospital for inappropriate behavior and disturbed memory. He presents with severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation. Neurologic examination showed horizontal nystagmus. He also has bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema. CT studies of the brain were normal. The duty physician suspects the patient may be vitamin deficient. Which of the following reactions does the deficient vitamin mediate?
Options:
(A): Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH
(B): Acetyl-CoA + Oxaloacetate + H2O <=> Citrate + CoA + H+
(C): Succinate + FAD (enzyme bound) <=> Fumarate + FADH2
(D): Isocitrate + NAD+ <=> Alpha-Ketoglutarate + CO2 + NADH
(E): Succinyl-CoA + Pi + GDP <=> Succinate + GTP + CoA
",Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH,Correct,"The correct choice is (A): Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including severe retrograde memory loss, confusion, and confabulation, along with physical findings such as bilateral pretibial pitting edema and perioral erythema, are consistent with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, which is caused by chronic thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. Thiamine is a cofactor for several enzymes, including α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which mediates the reaction: Alpha-Ketoglutarate + NAD+ + CoA <=> Succinyl-CoA + CO2 + NADH. Thiamine deficiency leads to impaired α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity, resulting in a decrease in cerebral glucose utilization and mitochondrial damage. This can lead to the accumulation of glutamate and excitotoxic cell damage, contributing to the neurologic symptoms seen in Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Therefore, the deficient vitamin in this case mediates the reaction involving alpha-ketoglutarate.",
"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks gestation is brought to the emergency department by her husband. She is in active labor and has lost a lot of blood in the past 2 hours, but appears alert and cooperative. At the hospital, her blood pressure is 88/65 mm Hg, the pulse is 110/min, and the respirations are 23/min. Neither the hospital nor the emergency department is equipped for high-risk pregnancies. The patient and her husband request a transfer to a more capable center. They are informed of the hospital’s obligations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act and the risks of transfer. They insist to be transferred. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): After stabilizing the patient, allow the family to leave in their car to go to a different facility
(B): Decline admission and refer the patient to the closest capable emergency department
(C): Disregard patient’s request and treat until delivery is complete
(D): Treat and transfer the patient after she makes a written request
(E): Transfer the patient only if the medical benefits of transfer outweigh the risks
",Treat and transfer the patient after she makes a written request,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Treat and transfer the patient after she makes a written request.

Explanation:
According to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), a pregnant patient with an emergency obstetric condition who presents to a hospital providing obstetric services is not considered stabilized until delivery of the infant and placenta. In this case, the patient is in active labor and has lost a lot of blood, indicating an emergency obstetric condition. Therefore, the patient cannot be transferred until she makes a written request for transfer.

It is important to respect the patient's autonomy and allow her to make decisions about her own healthcare. By treating the patient and stabilizing her condition, the healthcare team can ensure her safety during the transfer to a more capable center. Once the patient makes a written request for transfer, the healthcare team can proceed with arranging the transfer to a facility that can provide the necessary care for her high-risk pregnancy.

Options A, B, and C are not appropriate because they do not take into account the patient's request for transfer and the need to stabilize her condition before transferring. Option E is not the most appropriate choice because it does not address the patient's request for transfer and the need for stabilization.",
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to your office with complaints of wheezing and dyspnea. Laboratory work reveals eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens. Which of the following types of drugs would be an effective treatment in this patient?
Options:
(A): Beta-2 antagonist
(B): Histone deacetylase inhibitor
(C): VEGF inhibitor
(D): Muscarinic antagonist
(E): Anticoagulant
",Muscarinic antagonist,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Muscarinic antagonist.

Explanation:
The symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea, along with eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens, suggest that the patient is experiencing an allergic reaction. In this case, the most effective treatment would be a muscarinic antagonist.

Muscarinic antagonists, also known as anticholinergics, work by blocking the action of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. This leads to bronchodilation and helps relieve symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea in patients with allergic reactions or asthma.

Beta-2 agonists (option A) are also commonly used in the treatment of asthma, but they primarily work by stimulating beta-2 receptors in the airways to relax smooth muscles. While they can provide relief for wheezing and dyspnea, they are not the most effective treatment for this specific patient with eosinophilia and positive skin tests for allergens.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (option B) and VEGF inhibitors (option C) are not commonly used in the treatment of allergic reactions or asthma. Histone deacetylase inhibitors are primarily used in the treatment of certain cancers, while VEGF inhibitors are used in the treatment of conditions such as cancer and age-related macular degeneration.

Anticoagulants (option E) are used to prevent or treat blood clots and are not indicated for the treatment of allergic reactions or asthma.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice for the effective treatment of this patient's symptoms would be a muscarinic antagonist (option D).",
"A 16-year-old healthy female presents to her pediatrician concerned that she has not had a menstrual period. She has no past medical history and takes no medications. She plays volleyball and gets good grades in school. Her BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination reveals normal female external genitalia and pubic hair along the mons pubis and superomedial thighs. Her breasts appear normal. Transabdominal ultrasound reveals an absent uterus. Serum testosterone levels is within the normal range for females. What is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Pituitary tumor
(B): Absence of second X chromosome
(C): Mutation in enzyme that metabolizes testosterone
(D): Androgen receptor mutation
(E): Failure of paramesonephric duct development
",Failure of paramesonephric duct development,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Failure of paramesonephric duct development.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, which is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the uterus and upper two-thirds of the vagina. The external genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics are typically normal in MRKH syndrome, as seen in this patient. The absence of a uterus is confirmed by transabdominal ultrasound. MRKH syndrome is caused by a failure of the paramesonephric ducts to develop properly during embryogenesis. This is the most likely cause of this patient's condition. Pituitary tumors (choice A) can cause hormonal imbalances, but they would not result in the absence of a uterus. Absence of a second X chromosome (choice B) would result in Turner syndrome, which is associated with a variety of physical findings, including short stature, webbed neck, and cardiac abnormalities. Mutation in an enzyme that metabolizes testosterone (choice C) would not result in the absence of a uterus. Androgen receptor mutation (choice D) would result in androgen insensitivity syndrome, which is characterized by the inability of the body to respond to androgens. This would result in the development of female external genitalia, but the absence of a uterus is not a feature of this condition.",
"A 61-year-old nulliparous woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Her last Pap smear 3 years ago showed atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. HPV testing was negative at that time. On questioning, she has had fatigue and an increase in abdominal girth despite a 5-kg (11.0-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. She has gastroesophageal reflux disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Menarche was at the age of 10 years and her last menstrual period was 2 years ago. Current medications include omeprazole and levothyroxine. Abdominal examination shows shifting dullness. There is tenderness to palpation of the right lower quadrant but no guarding or rebound. Bimanual palpation shows a small uterus and a right adnexal mass. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Proliferation of endometrial glands
(B): Elevated serum CA-125 level
(C): Elevated serum beta-hCG level
(D): Prolonged prothrombin time
(E): Cervical dysplasia on Pap smear
",Elevated serum CA-125 level,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Elevated serum CA-125 level.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is concerning for ovarian cancer. The risk factors for ovarian cancer include increasing age, nulliparity, family history of ovarian or breast cancer, and certain genetic mutations (eg, BRCA1, BRCA2). Symptoms of ovarian cancer are often nonspecific and include abdominal bloating, increased abdominal girth, early satiety, and weight loss. Physical examination findings may include a palpable pelvic mass, ascites, and/or pleural effusion. In this patient, the presence of an adnexal mass on bimanual examination, along with shifting dullness on abdominal examination, suggests the presence of ascites. The most appropriate next step in the evaluation of a suspected ovarian mass is to obtain a serum CA-125 level. CA-125 is a tumor marker that is elevated in most patients with ovarian cancer. However, it is important to note that CA-125 is not specific for ovarian cancer and can be elevated in other conditions, such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Therefore, a positive CA-125 result should be followed by transvaginal ultrasonography and/or referral to a gynecologic oncologist for further evaluation and management.",
"An unresponsive 92-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance and is quickly followed by his grand-daughter. Approx. 1 month ago, he had a radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and several rounds of chemotherapy for aggressive prostate cancer in Nicaragua and was discharged from the hospital with a suprapelvic catheter and a plan for more chemotherapy. He was coming to the United States to spend time with some extended family. According to the grand-daughter his mental status was altered upon arrival and his health began to decline. She is not aware of his past medical status or medications. At the hospital, his blood pressure is 98/60 mm Hg, the pulse id 110/min, the respiratory rate is 21/min, and the temperature is 35.6°C (96.1°F). On physical exam, the patient appears cachectic, drowsy, and only responds to questions by nodding his head. His heart rate is tachycardic with a regular rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cystotomy incision for his suprapelvic catheter is red and swollen. The patient admitted to the hospital and stabilized and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. The catheter tube produces no urine over 24 hours and only thick green-white puss can be expressed. The treatment team concludes this patient has urinary tract obstruction. What is the best method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction in this patient?
Options:
(A): Renal biopsy
(B): Ultrasound
(C): Abdominal-pelvic CT scan
(D): Blood analysis
(E): Urine analysis
",Ultrasound,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Ultrasound.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of radical prostatectomy, pelvic radiation, and chemotherapy, presenting with an altered mental status, cachexia, and an obstructed suprapubic catheter with thick green-white pus, the most appropriate method to evaluate urinary tract obstruction is an ultrasound.

Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide valuable information about the urinary tract. It can help identify the presence of urinary tract obstruction, determine the level and cause of obstruction, and assess the condition of the kidneys and bladder. In this case, an ultrasound can be used to evaluate the patency of the ureters, identify any structural abnormalities or masses, and assess the kidneys for hydronephrosis or other signs of obstruction.

Renal biopsy (A) is not indicated in this case as the patient's presentation is consistent with urinary tract obstruction rather than a renal pathology. A renal biopsy is typically performed to evaluate renal parenchymal disease.

Abdominal-pelvic CT scan (C) may provide detailed imaging of the urinary tract, but it is not the initial imaging modality of choice in this case. CT scan involves radiation exposure and may not be feasible in an unstable patient. Ultrasound is a safer and more readily available option.

Blood analysis (D) and urine analysis (E) are important diagnostic tests in the evaluation of urinary tract obstruction, but they do not directly evaluate the obstruction itself. Blood analysis can provide information about renal function and electrolyte abnormalities, while urine analysis can help identify signs of infection or other urinary abnormalities. However, in this case, the patient's clinical presentation and the findings of an obstructed suprapubic catheter with thick green-white pus already suggest urinary tract obstruction, making ultrasound the most appropriate next step in evaluation.",
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for intermittent shaking of his hands. He reports that for the last several years he has noticed this ""shaking"" when he brushes his teeth and prepares a cup of coffee in the morning. The shaking then gradually improves over the course of the day. His past medical history is otherwise notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia. His only home medication is pravastatin. The patient smokes half a pack per day of cigarettes and drinks 2-3 beers throughout the day. His family history is significant for Parkinson disease in his father. On physical exam, his blood pressure is 159/84, pulse is 74/min, and respirations are 12/min. He has a high frequency bilateral hand tremor elicited on finger-to-nose testing. His neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient should be started on which of the following medications?
Options:
(A): Alprazolam
(B): Primidone
(C): Propranolol
(D): Topiramate
(E): Trihexyphenidyl
",Propranolol,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Propranolol.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of intermittent shaking of his hands, which improves over the course of the day, and the presence of a high frequency bilateral hand tremor, the most likely diagnosis is essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by involuntary shaking of the hands, head, or other parts of the body. It typically worsens with movement and improves with rest.

Propranolol, a non-selective beta-blocker, is the first-line treatment for essential tremor. It works by blocking the action of adrenaline on beta receptors, reducing the tremor. Propranolol has been shown to be effective in reducing the severity and frequency of essential tremor symptoms.

Alprazolam (A) is a benzodiazepine that may be used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, but it is not the first-line treatment for essential tremor.

Primidone (B) is an anticonvulsant medication that can be used as an alternative treatment for essential tremor if propranolol is ineffective or not tolerated. However, it is not the first-line treatment.

Topiramate (D) is an anticonvulsant medication that may be used for the treatment of epilepsy and migraine prevention, but it is not the first-line treatment for essential tremor.

Trihexyphenidyl (E) is an anticholinergic medication that is primarily used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms. It is not the first-line treatment for essential tremor.",
"A pediatrician notices that 9 of her patients this year have developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. They range in age from 7 to 11, and most of them had no abnormal activities prior to developing the paralysis. These patients concern her because she has not seen this type of paralytic illness in over 20 years of practice. Based on this experience, she decides to write up the initial presentation and clinical course of these patients and publish them in a journal. Which of the following is most likely true about this study?
Options:
(A): Different interventions with 2 or more variables can be studied
(B): Hypothesis testing cannot be performed
(C): It should be reported in terms of odds ratio
(D): It should be reported in terms of relative risk
(E): Participants act as their own controls
",Hypothesis testing cannot be performed,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Hypothesis testing cannot be performed.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the pediatrician is observing a group of patients who have developed paralysis after a flu-like illness. She wants to publish her findings in a journal. However, it is important to note that this is an observational study and not an experimental study. 

Observational studies, such as this one, do not involve any interventions or manipulation of variables. The pediatrician is simply observing and documenting the cases of paralysis in her patients. Therefore, different interventions with 2 or more variables cannot be studied in this context, making option (A) incorrect.

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant relationship between variables or if the observed results are due to chance. In this case, the pediatrician is not testing any specific hypothesis or comparing groups, but rather describing the initial presentation and clinical course of the patients. Therefore, hypothesis testing cannot be performed, making option (B) correct.

Options (C) and (D) suggest that the study should be reported in terms of odds ratio or relative risk. However, these measures are typically used in studies that involve comparing groups or assessing the association between variables. In this case, the pediatrician is not comparing groups or assessing associations, but rather describing the cases of paralysis. Therefore, options (C) and (D) are incorrect.

Option (E) suggests that the participants act as their own controls. However, in this scenario, there is no control group or comparison being made. The pediatrician is simply describing the cases of paralysis in her patients. Therefore, option (E) is also incorrect.

Overall, the most likely true statement about this study is that hypothesis testing cannot be performed.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after a motor vehicle accident. He is unconscious upon arrival and is found to have severe internal bleeding due to trauma. He is taken for emergency surgery and severely damaged tissues are removed. After surgery, the boy is taken into the PICU for recovery. Over the subsequent week, serial labs are drawn showing target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. He is started on a prophylactic regimen that is continued upon discharge. Which of the following is consistent with the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed in this case?
Options:
(A): 30S ribosome inhibitor
(B): 50S ribosome inhibitor
(C): Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor
(D): DNA gyrase inhibitor
(E): Folate metabolism inhibitor
",Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Cell wall cross-linking inhibitor.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has undergone emergency surgery for severe internal bleeding due to trauma. After surgery, the patient develops target cells, thrombocytosis, and leukocytosis. These findings suggest that the patient is at risk for infection and is likely receiving prophylactic antibiotics.

Cell wall cross-linking inhibitors, such as beta-lactam antibiotics (e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins), are commonly used as prophylactic antibiotics in surgical patients. These antibiotics work by inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, leading to cell lysis and death. They are effective against a wide range of bacteria, including both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.

In this case, the patient's severe trauma and subsequent surgery have likely caused tissue damage and disruption of the skin barrier, increasing the risk of infection. Therefore, a cell wall cross-linking inhibitor, such as a beta-lactam antibiotic, would be an appropriate choice to prevent infection in this patient.",
"A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of several weeks of intense itching, particularly localized around his anus. Of note, the patient denies any recent travel, sexual contacts, fever, dysuria, or diarrhea. His temperature is 98.1°F (36.7°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 12/min. On exam, the patient demonstrates severe excoriations in his perianal region with slight erythema over the areas that are torn. He does not have any other dermatologic findings. The scotch tape test is positive. The patient has a previous documented allergy to albendazole. Which of the following is an alternative medication that can be used?
Options:
(A): Amphotericin B
(B): Diethylcarbamazine
(C): Ivermectin
(D): Praziquantel
(E): Pyrantel pamoate
",Pyrantel pamoate,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Pyrantel pamoate.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and positive scotch tape test, the most likely diagnosis is enterobiasis, also known as pinworm infection. Enterobiasis is caused by the parasite Enterobius vermicularis and is characterized by intense perianal itching, especially at night. The scotch tape test involves pressing a piece of clear tape against the perianal region and examining it under a microscope for the presence of pinworm eggs.

Albendazole is the treatment of choice for enterobiasis. However, since the patient has a documented allergy to albendazole, an alternative medication is needed. Pyrantel pamoate is an anthelmintic medication that is effective against pinworms and can be used as an alternative treatment. It works by paralyzing the worms, causing them to be expelled from the body in the stool.

Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication and is not indicated for the treatment of enterobiasis. Diethylcarbamazine is used to treat lymphatic filariasis and not enterobiasis. Ivermectin is used to treat various parasitic infections, but it is not the first-line treatment for enterobiasis. Praziquantel is used to treat certain types of parasitic infections, such as schistosomiasis and tapeworm infections, but it is not effective against pinworms.",
"A 21-year-old female presents to the office after a health screening in which she was found to have high blood pressure. At the office, the blood pressure is 168/114 mm Hg. You have seen the patient in the past for amenorrhea and infertility issues, but she denies taking any medication at this time. On examination, the patient is short and normal weight but has a webbed neck. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure?
Options:
(A): Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys 
(B): Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension
(C): Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland
(D): Oral contraceptive use
(E): Chronic corticosteroid use
",Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys ,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of short stature, normal weight, and webbed neck is consistent with Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females. Turner syndrome is associated with various cardiovascular abnormalities, including coarctation of the aorta and renal abnormalities. In this case, the most likely cause of the elevated blood pressure is central fusion of the inferior poles of the kidneys, which can lead to renal artery stenosis and subsequent hypertension. This is a common finding in patients with Turner syndrome and can contribute to the development of high blood pressure. Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension (choice B) is less likely in a young patient without a family history of hypertension. Neuroendocrine tumor of the adrenal gland (choice C) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as palpitations or weight loss. Oral contraceptive use (choice D) and chronic corticosteroid use (choice E) are not mentioned in the patient's history and are less likely to be the cause of her elevated blood pressure.",
"A 25-year-old African American man presents to his primary care provider for routine blood work. He is a well-known case of sickle cell disease treated with hydroxyurea and tramadol as needed for pain. He does not smoke or drink alcohol. The patient asks if his disease can adversely affect his kidneys because his friend was recently diagnosed with end-stage renal failure. Which of the following is a renal complication of sickle cell disease?
Options:
(A): Transitional cell carcinoma
(B): Membranous glomerulonephritis
(C): Proximal renal tubular acidosis
(D): Impaired urine diluting ability
(E): Impaired urine concentration ability
",Impaired urine concentration ability,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Impaired urine concentration ability.

Explanation:
Renal complications are common in sickle cell disease (SCD), with up to one-fifth of patients eventually developing chronic kidney disease. One of the renal complications of SCD is impaired urine concentration ability, also known as hyposthenuria. This means that the kidneys are unable to concentrate urine effectively, leading to a decreased ability to conserve water and concentrate urine. This can result in increased urine output and polyuria. 

Other renal complications of SCD include:
- Abnormalities in urinary acidification and potassium excretion associated with distal renal tubular acidosis
- Acute kidney injury (AKI) associated with hospitalization
- Painless hematuria due to papillary infarcts
- Proteinuria from albuminuria, which is often a precursor of progressive kidney disease
- Contrast-induced nephropathy associated with intravenous iodinated contrast material used for imaging studies
- Medication toxicities, especially if glomerular filtration rate is overestimated
- Hypertension
- Kidney infarction, papillary necrosis, and renal colic
- Arginine vasopressin resistance (previously called nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) with polyuria
- Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis that can lead to end-stage kidney disease

It is important for patients with SCD to avoid unnecessary exposure to nephrotoxic medications and to maintain adequate hydration during acute hospitalizations or imaging studies that require contrast agents. Regular monitoring of kidney function, including creatinine levels and urine protein and albumin levels, is recommended to detect and manage any abnormalities.",
"A gunshot victim is brought to the Emergency Department and appears to be in shock. You note a penetrating wound at the level of L3. Assuming the bullet remained at this level, which vascular structure might have been injured?
Options:
(A): Inferior vena cava
(B): Internal iliac artery
(C): Internal iliac vein
(D): Renal artery
(E): Portal vein
",Inferior vena cava,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Inferior vena cava.

Explanation:
In this scenario, with a penetrating wound at the level of L3, the most likely vascular structure to be injured is the inferior vena cava (IVC). The IVC is a large vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the lower body back to the heart. It runs alongside the spine and is located in the retroperitoneal space, which is the area behind the abdominal cavity.

The IVC is at risk of injury in cases of trauma, especially when there is a penetrating injury to the abdomen or back. In this case, the bullet has penetrated at the level of L3, which is in close proximity to the IVC. The bullet may have directly injured the IVC or caused damage to nearby structures that could lead to IVC injury.

Injuries to the IVC can be life-threatening and result in significant blood loss and shock. Prompt recognition and management are crucial. Surgical exploration is often required to identify and repair the injured IVC. Hemostatic agents, sutures, or ligation may be used depending on the extent of the injury.

The other options listed (B) Internal iliac artery, (C) Internal iliac vein, (D) Renal artery, and (E) Portal vein are less likely to be injured in this scenario. While these structures are also located in the retroperitoneal space and can be at risk of injury in trauma, the proximity of the bullet to the IVC makes it the most likely vascular structure to be affected.",
"A clinical trial is conducted to test the efficacy of a new drug, A, to treat tinea versicolor. A total of 500 participants are recruited for the study and are randomized into 2 groups in equal numbers. Group 1, the study treatment group, is given drug A, while group 2, the control group, is given the current standard antifungal therapy. After the completion of therapy, 190 participants from the study treatment group and 165 participants from the control group are cured. Which calculation below represents the number needed to treat for the new drug?
Options:
(A): 25/250
(B): 250/25
(C): 190/250
(D): 165/250
(E): 355/500
",250/25,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): 250/25.

Explanation:
The number needed to treat (NNT) is a measure used in clinical trials to determine the number of patients that need to be treated with a specific intervention in order to achieve one additional positive outcome compared to a control group.

In this case, the NNT for the new drug A can be calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute risk reduction (ARR), which is the difference in the proportion of participants cured between the study treatment group and the control group.

The ARR can be calculated by subtracting the proportion of participants cured in the control group from the proportion of participants cured in the study treatment group:

ARR = Proportion cured in study treatment group - Proportion cured in control group

In this case, the proportion of participants cured in the study treatment group is 190/250 = 0.76, and the proportion of participants cured in the control group is 165/250 = 0.66.

ARR = 0.76 - 0.66 = 0.10

Therefore, the NNT can be calculated as the reciprocal of the ARR:

NNT = 1/ARR = 1/0.10 = 10

This means that for every 10 patients treated with the new drug A, one additional patient will be cured compared to the control group. Therefore, the correct calculation for the NNT is 250/25.",
"A 38-year-old woman is being evaluated by her primary care physician for chronic, widespread pain that started around 5 months ago. This pain has been accompanied by sleeping issues. Her friend recommended that she try yoga to relieve the pain, but she says this has not helped her at all. Se says the symptoms have begun to impact her daily functions and keep her from doing things she used to enjoy. Past medical history includes generalized anxiety disorder, for which she currently takes no medication. The patient had been previously medicated with paroxetine for 5 years. On physical examination, several areas of point tenderness are found on the occipital region, elbows, and medial surface of both knees. Laboratory work up is unremarkable. What is the best treatment option for the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Low-dose prednisolone
(B): High-dose prednisolone
(C): Paroxetine
(D): Allopurinol
(E): Gabapentin
",Paroxetine,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Paroxetine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of chronic widespread pain, sleeping issues, and impact on daily functions, along with the presence of tender points on physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and tender points.

Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the best treatment option for this patient. SSRIs have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia. Paroxetine specifically has been studied and shown to be beneficial in the treatment of fibromyalgia.

Low-dose or high-dose prednisolone, options (A) and (B), are not appropriate for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that is typically used for its anti-inflammatory effects and is not indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

Allopurinol, option (D), is a medication used to treat gout by reducing the production of uric acid. It is not indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia.

Gabapentin, option (E), is an anticonvulsant medication that is sometimes used off-label for the treatment of fibromyalgia. However, paroxetine has been shown to be more effective in reducing pain and improving symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia compared to gabapentin. Therefore, paroxetine is the preferred treatment option in this case.",
"A 3rd year resident in good standing with his residency training program would like to work more hours outside his residency obligations to gain more experience and pay for his medical school loans. He currently works and trains 60 hours per week as a resident and has a 10-hour shift external to his residency program on Saturdays. He is free of any educational and work obligations on Sundays. Based on the most recent standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding this resident’s moonlighting and patient safety?
Options:
(A): He is already overcommitting and must reduce the number of hours
(B): He is not allowed to work outside the scope of his residency training
(C): He may work longer shifts
(D): He may work more hours on Sundays
(E): He may work up to 20 more hours
",He may work longer shifts,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): He may work longer shifts.

Explanation:
According to the most recent standards set by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), residents are limited to no more than 80 hours of work per week over a 4-week period. They are also not allowed to work more than 24 consecutive hours. However, there are no specific restrictions on the length of individual shifts. Therefore, the resident in question may work longer shifts as long as they do not exceed the maximum weekly and consecutive hour limits.",
"A 29-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. On presentation, he is found to have scalp and trunk lacerations that are still actively bleeding. He has no past medical history and does not take any medications. On presentation, his temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/74 mmHg, pulse is 82/min, and respirations are 17/min. On physical exam, he is found to be anxious but does not have any visible injuries other than the lacerations. Which of the following processes would most likely be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Baroreceptor-mediated vasodilation
(B): Chemoreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction
(C): Increased acetylcholine at the sinoatrial node
(D): Increased atrial natriuretic peptide release
(E): Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node
",Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node.

Explanation:
In this patient, the most likely process that would be seen is increased norepinephrine at the sinoatrial node. This is because the patient is experiencing a stressful situation due to the motor vehicle accident, which can activate the sympathetic nervous system. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of norepinephrine, which acts on the sinoatrial node to increase heart rate. This is a normal physiological response to stress or trauma, known as the ""fight or flight"" response. The increased heart rate helps to increase blood flow and oxygen delivery to the body's tissues, which is important in situations of acute stress or injury.",
"A 14-year-old teenager presents to his pediatrician complaining of frequent headaches and excessive fatigue during soccer practice. His mother notes that he seems to have gained a lot of weight despite the fact that he eats a healthy, well-balanced diet. His teachers have also become concerned because he leaves class to use the restroom frequently throughout the day. He has no medical problems and family history is insignificant. A physical exam is significant for a short, overweight child with nonpitting edema and decreased reflexes. His systolic blood pressure drops by 20 mm Hg when he stands. Fundoscopic exam is significant for papilledema and visual field exam is significant for bitemporal hemianopsia. Laboratory findings include:
BUN 22 mg/dL N: 7–20 mg/dL
pCO2 32 mm Hg N: 35–45 mm Hg
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL N: 0.8–1.4 mg/dL
Glucose 50 mg/dL N: 64–128 mg/dL
Serum chloride 95 mmol/L N: 101–111 mmol/L
Serum potassium 3.3 mEq/L N: 3.7–5.2 mEq/L
Serum sodium 120 mEq/L N: 136–144 mEq/L
Bicarbonate (HCO3) 15 mmol/L N: 18–22 mmol/L
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.1 mIU/L N: 0.5–5 mIU/L
Free T4 6 pmol/L N: 10–20 pmol/L
What is the necessary treatment?
Options:
(A): Chemotherapy, surgical resection and radiation
(B): Chemotherapy and radiation
(C): Chemotherapy
(D): Surgical resection
(E): Hormone replacement therapy
",Surgical resection,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Surgical resection.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is a pituitary adenoma causing secondary hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency. The symptoms of frequent headaches, excessive fatigue, weight gain despite a healthy diet, and frequent urination are consistent with the effects of a pituitary adenoma. The physical exam findings of short stature, overweight, nonpitting edema, and decreased reflexes further support this diagnosis.

The laboratory findings of low free T4 and low TSH levels indicate secondary hypothyroidism, which is commonly seen in patients with pituitary adenomas. The low levels of growth hormone can explain the patient's short stature and weight gain.

The presence of papilledema and bitemporal hemianopsia on the fundoscopic and visual field exams, respectively, suggest compression of the optic chiasm by the pituitary adenoma.

The necessary treatment for a pituitary adenoma causing these symptoms is surgical resection. Surgery aims to remove the tumor and relieve the compression on the optic chiasm. After surgery, hormone replacement therapy may be required to manage the secondary hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency.

Chemotherapy and radiation are not appropriate treatments for a pituitary adenoma. Chemotherapy is typically used for the treatment of cancer, which is not the case in this patient. Radiation therapy may be considered in certain cases, but surgical resection is the primary treatment option.

Hormone replacement therapy may be necessary after surgical resection to manage the secondary hypothyroidism and growth hormone deficiency, but it is not the primary treatment for the pituitary adenoma itself.",
"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?
Options:
(A): A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
(B): A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
(C): A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell.
(D): A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell.
(E): A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.
",A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

Explanation:
In the given context, HIF-1α is a transcription factor that is stabilized and upregulated under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is hydroxylated by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, leading to its degradation. However, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), HIF-1α hydroxylation is inhibited, allowing it to escape degradation and accumulate even in the absence of hypoxia.

To detect HIF-1α in RCC under normoxic conditions, the most appropriate technique would be a Western blot. A Western blot is used to detect and quantify specific proteins in a sample. It involves separating proteins by size using gel electrophoresis, transferring them onto a membrane, and then using specific antibodies to detect the target protein. In this case, the researcher can use an antibody against HIF-1α to detect its increased levels in RCC compared to a normoxic control.

A Northern blot (option A) is used to detect and quantify specific RNA molecules, not proteins. Therefore, it would not be suitable for detecting HIF-1α protein levels.

A Southern blot (options C and D) is used to detect specific DNA sequences. Since HIF-1α is a protein, not DNA, a Southern blot would not be appropriate for this experiment.

Therefore, the correct option is (E): A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.",
"A 25-year-old primigravida is admitted to the hospital at 36 weeks gestation after a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. She is conscious, but lethargic and complains of a headache that started 2 hours prior to the seizure. She denies alcohol intake or drug use. She has no history of convulsive disorders and the antepartum course has been unremarkable. She was compliant with the recommended prenatal care and her last prenatal visit was 2 weeks ago. She has gained 2 kg (4.4 lb) since her last visit. The blood pressure was 160/90 mm Hg, the heart rate was 79/min, the respiratory rate was 14/min, and the temperature was 37.0℃ (98.6℉). The physical examination shows leg and perineal edema. The neurologic examination is significant for symmetric upper and lower extremity hyperreflexia and ankle clonus. Which of the following laboratory findings would be most common in this patient?
Options:
(A): Elevated transaminases
(B): Leukocytosis
(C): Hematuria
(D): Hyponatremia
(E): Proteinuria
",Proteinuria,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Proteinuria.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with preeclampsia, a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by new-onset hypertension and end-organ damage, such as proteinuria. Preeclampsia typically occurs after 20 weeks gestation and is associated with multiple organ systems, including the cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, and hematologic systems. Proteinuria is a hallmark finding in preeclampsia and is defined as a urinary protein excretion of ≥300 mg in a 24-hour urine collection or a protein/creatinine ratio of ≥0.3. It is caused by glomerular endothelial dysfunction and increased glomerular permeability. The presence of proteinuria in this patient, along with her hypertension, edema, and neurologic findings (hyperreflexia and ankle clonus), supports the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Elevated transaminases (choice A) can be seen in preeclampsia, but proteinuria is a more common finding. Leukocytosis (choice B) and hematuria (choice C) are not typical findings in preeclampsia. Hyponatremia (choice D) is not a common laboratory finding in preeclampsia.",
"A 3-year-old male is brought by his mother to the pediatrician's office. The mother and child are refugees from Somalia and arrived in the United States one week ago. They were recently placed in temporary housing. The mother reports that the child has been chronically tired and subdued since before their arrival in the United States. The child was born at 38 weeks gestation with the help of a local midwife. The child’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 105/60 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a listless child with a rotund abdomen and positive fluid wave. Notable lower extremity edema is present. This patient's condition is most likely caused by a deficiency in which of the following?
Options:
(A): Total caloric intake
(B): Relative protein intake
(C): Relative carbohydrate intake
(D): Relative fat intake
(E): Vitamin intake
",Relative protein intake,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Relative protein intake.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is a 3-year-old male who is a refugee from Somalia. He has been chronically tired and subdued since before arriving in the United States. On physical examination, he has a rotund abdomen, positive fluid wave, and lower extremity edema. These findings are consistent with kwashiorkor, a form of protein-energy malnutrition.

Kwashiorkor is caused by a relative deficiency in protein intake, despite adequate caloric intake. In this case, the child's total caloric intake may be sufficient, but the relative protein intake is inadequate. This is common in regions where diets are predominantly based on starchy foods, such as cassava or maize, which are low in protein. The child's symptoms of fatigue, edema, and abdominal distension are characteristic of kwashiorkor.

It is important to note that while total caloric intake is important for overall nutrition, in this case, the primary deficiency is in protein intake. Relative carbohydrate intake, relative fat intake, and vitamin intake are not the primary causes of the patient's symptoms in this scenario.",
"A 42-year-old woman presents to her obstetrician for a prenatal care appointment at 10 weeks gestation. The patient recently found out she was pregnant after having unprotected intercourse with her husband for the past year. She states that she is feeling well and has experienced some nausea and vomiting. She is currently taking prenatal vitamins and folate supplements. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you notice a gravid uterus 10 cm above the pubic symphysis. The patient's external genitalia appear within normal limits. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Amniocentesis
(B): Cell-free DNA testing
(C): Chorionic villus sampling
(D): Iron and vitamin D supplementation
(E): Regular follow up appointments
",Cell-free DNA testing,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Cell-free DNA testing.

Explanation:
Cell-free DNA testing, also known as noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), is the next best step in management for this patient. NIPT is a screening test that can be performed as early as 10 weeks gestation and is used to assess the risk of certain chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), trisomy 18, and trisomy 13. It involves analyzing the fetal DNA that is present in the mother's blood. 

Given the patient's age of 42, she is at an increased risk for chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus. Advanced maternal age is a known risk factor for these abnormalities. Therefore, it is important to offer her NIPT to assess the risk and provide appropriate counseling and management options.

Amniocentesis (option A) and chorionic villus sampling (option C) are invasive diagnostic tests that can provide definitive information about chromosomal abnormalities. However, they are associated with a small risk of miscarriage and are typically offered after a positive screening test result. In this case, since the patient has not yet undergone any screening tests, it is not appropriate to proceed directly to invasive testing.

Iron and vitamin D supplementation (option D) is a routine recommendation for pregnant women, but it is not the next best step in management for this patient. The focus at this stage should be on assessing the risk of chromosomal abnormalities.

Regular follow-up appointments (option E) are important for prenatal care, but they do not address the specific concern of assessing the risk of chromosomal abnormalities in this patient.

Therefore, the next best step in management for this patient is to offer cell-free DNA testing (option B) to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities.",
"A 6-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of abdominal distention, fatigue, and night sweats over the past 4 months. He also has a 2-month history of post-prandial fullness and recurrent nonbilious vomiting. He appears pale. Abdominal examination shows hepatosplenomegaly and shifting dullness; there is mild tenderness to palpation. Examination of the skin shows multiple nonblanching maculae. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen from an enlarged mesenteric lymph node is shown. Immunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen shows that the proliferation index of the specimen is > 99%. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely which of the following?
Options:
(A): Neutrophil
(B): Human immunodeficiency virus
(C): B lymphocytes
(D): Macrophage
(E): Epstein-Barr virus
",Macrophage,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Macrophage.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and the photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen, the structure indicated by the arrows is most likely a macrophage. 

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal distention, fatigue, night sweats, post-prandial fullness, and recurrent nonbilious vomiting, along with physical examination findings of hepatosplenomegaly and shifting dullness, are suggestive of a systemic disease process. The presence of multiple nonblanching maculae on the skin further supports this.

The CT scan findings of mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph node enlargement and nodular thickening of the omentum are consistent with lymphadenopathy and omental infiltration, which can be seen in certain systemic diseases.

The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen shows a cellular infiltrate with enlarged cells that have abundant cytoplasm and indented or folded nuclei. This morphology is characteristic of macrophages, which are phagocytic cells involved in the immune response. The immunohistochemical staining of the Ki-67 nuclear antigen, which indicates cellular proliferation, shows a proliferation index of > 99%, suggesting that these macrophages are actively dividing.

Therefore, the structure indicated by the arrows in the photomicrograph is most likely a macrophage, which is consistent with the clinical presentation and findings.",
"A 14-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after falling from the jungle gym and developing severe left knee pain and swelling. On presentation, he is found to be in pain with a hot, swollen, erythematous left knee. His past medical history is significant for abnormal coagulation lab tests before an appendectomy, but his mother cannot recall the exact details. Coagulation tests are conducted with the following results:

Bleeding time: 3 minutes
Prothrombin time: 11 seconds
Partial thromboplastin time: 53 seconds
Bradykinin formation: decreased

Which of the following factors is most likely defective in this patient?
Options:
(A): Factor VII
(B): Factor VIII
(C): Factor IX
(D): Factor X
(E): Factor XII
",Factor XII,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Factor XII.

Factor XII, also known as Hageman factor, is a coagulation factor involved in the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade. It plays a role in the activation of factor XI, which in turn activates factor IX. Deficiency or dysfunction of factor XII leads to a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) without an increased bleeding tendency.

In this patient, the prolonged PTT suggests a defect in the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. The normal bleeding time and prothrombin time indicate that the extrinsic pathway and common pathway are intact. Additionally, the decreased bradykinin formation is a characteristic finding in factor XII deficiency.

Factors VII, VIII, IX, and X are all part of the extrinsic pathway or common pathway of coagulation and are not likely to be defective in this patient. Therefore, the most likely factor that is defective in this patient is Factor XII.",
"A 52-year-old man with Crohn disease comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of dysuria and urinary urgency. He had been treated for urinary tract infections twice in the past 6 months. He is currently taking infliximab. Cystoscopy shows pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall. Biopsy of these lesions shows a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium with hyperkeratosis. If the patient's bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, which of the following features is also most likely to be seen?
Options:
(A): Carpopedal spasm
(B): Perifollicular hemorrhage
(C): Photodermatitis
(D): Night blindness
(E): Intracranial hypertension
",Night blindness,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Night blindness.

Explanation:
The patient's bladder finding of pearl-like plaques on the bladder wall with a focal layer of stratified squamous epithelium and hyperkeratosis is consistent with bladder involvement in a condition called squamous metaplasia. Squamous metaplasia occurs when the normal transitional epithelium of the bladder is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium. This can be caused by chronic irritation or inflammation of the bladder, such as in the case of urinary tract infections.

If the bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, it is most likely due to a deficiency in vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for maintaining the health of epithelial tissues, including the bladder lining. Deficiency in vitamin A can lead to squamous metaplasia in various epithelial tissues, including the bladder.

One of the classic manifestations of vitamin A deficiency is night blindness. Vitamin A is necessary for the synthesis of rhodopsin, a pigment found in the retina that is essential for vision in low light conditions. Deficiency in vitamin A can impair the synthesis of rhodopsin, leading to difficulty seeing in dim light or at night.

Therefore, if the patient's bladder finding is caused by a vitamin deficiency, the most likely feature to be seen is night blindness.",
"A 26-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 24 weeks gestation is admitted to the labor and delivery suite with mild abdominal cramps, uterine contractions, and a watery vaginal discharge. She has a history of preterm birth. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate 100/min; respiratory rate 13/min; and temperature 36.6℃ (97.9℉). The pelvic examination reveals cervical softening and shortening. Transvaginal ultrasound shows a cervical length of 12 mm, which is consistent with preterm labor. A tocolytic and a single dose of betamethasone are administered. Betamethasone stimulates which fetal cells?
Options:
(A): Type I pneumocytes
(B): Goblet cells
(C): Bronchial epithelial cells
(D): Type II pneumocytes
(E): Vascular smooth myocytes
",Type II pneumocytes,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Type II pneumocytes.

Explanation:
Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used in obstetrics to promote fetal lung maturation in cases of preterm labor. It acts by stimulating the production of surfactant by the fetal lungs. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins that reduces surface tension in the alveoli, preventing their collapse during expiration and promoting lung expansion. 

Type II pneumocytes are the cells responsible for producing surfactant in the fetal lungs. These cells start to differentiate and produce surfactant around 24-28 weeks of gestation. By stimulating the production of surfactant, betamethasone helps to improve lung function and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. 

Therefore, in this case, betamethasone would stimulate the Type II pneumocytes in the fetus to promote lung maturation.",
"A 55-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after collapsing at the grocery store and losing consciousness for 1 minute following a sudden onset of palpitations. He has no chest pain or dizziness. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is currently being treated as an outpatient for pneumonia. His current medications include lisinopril, metformin, and azithromycin. He has no sign of injury, and he appears well. During the examination, he loses consciousness again. Telemetry shows polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis, which spontaneously resolves after 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's syncope?
Options:
(A): Hypomagnesemia
(B): Brugada syndrome
(C): Prolonged QT interval
(D): Accessory conduction pathway
(E): Hyperkalemia
",Prolonged QT interval,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Prolonged QT interval.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of syncope following palpitations and the presence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with cyclic alteration of the QRS axis on telemetry suggests a cardiac arrhythmia as the underlying cause. The most likely arrhythmia in this case is torsades de pointes, which is characterized by a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with a characteristic twisting pattern around the isoelectric line. Torsades de pointes is often associated with a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). 

The patient's history of medications, including azithromycin, is important in this case. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsades de pointes. This risk is further increased in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, such as electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia), bradycardia, and certain genetic conditions (e.g., congenital long QT syndrome).

Therefore, in this patient, the most likely underlying cause of syncope is a prolonged QT interval, likely exacerbated by the use of azithromycin and possibly other risk factors.",
"A 56-year-old patient is being treated with oral amoxicillin for community-acquired pneumonia. The plasma clearance of the drug is calculated as 15.0 L/h. Oral bioavailability of the drug is 75%. Sensitivity analysis of a sputum culture shows a minimal inhibitory concentration of 1 μg/mL for the causative pathogen. The target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L. If the drug is administered twice per day, which of the following dosages should be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state?
Options:
(A): 270 mg
(B): 480 mg
(C): 135 mg
(D): 240 mg
(E): 540 mg
""
",480 mg,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) 480 mg.

Explanation:
To maintain a steady state, the total daily dose of amoxicillin should be equal to the clearance multiplied by the target plasma concentration. 

Total daily dose = Clearance x Target plasma concentration

Given that the clearance is 15.0 L/h and the target plasma concentration is 2 mg/L, we can calculate the total daily dose as follows:

Total daily dose = 15.0 L/h x 2 mg/L = 30 mg/h

Since the drug is administered twice per day, we need to divide the total daily dose by 2 to determine the dosage for each dosing interval:

Dosage per dosing interval = Total daily dose / Number of dosing intervals per day

Dosage per dosing interval = 30 mg/h / 2 = 15 mg/h

However, we need to take into account the oral bioavailability of the drug, which is 75%. This means that only 75% of the administered dose will be absorbed into the bloodstream. 

Therefore, the actual dosage that needs to be administered at each dosing interval is:

Actual dosage per dosing interval = Dosage per dosing interval / Oral bioavailability

Actual dosage per dosing interval = 15 mg/h / 0.75 = 20 mg/h

To convert this dosage to milligrams per dosing interval, we need to multiply it by the number of hours in each dosing interval. Assuming each dosing interval is 12 hours, the dosage per dosing interval in milligrams is:

Dosage per dosing interval = Actual dosage per dosing interval x Number of hours in each dosing interval

Dosage per dosing interval = 20 mg/h x 12 h = 240 mg

Therefore, the correct dosage to be administered at each dosing interval to maintain a steady state is 240 mg.",
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office by his parents after they noticed blood in his urine. The child has been complaining of difficulty in passing urine and has lower abdominal pain. He seems more bloated than usual. On some occasions, he starts crying while passing urine, primarily because of a burning sensation. A urinalysis is performed, and the results are as follows:
Urine pH 6.2
Urine specific gravity 1.010
Glucose Negative
Ketones Negative
RBCs 1-2/hpf
WBCs 0-1/hpf
Casts 2-3/hpf
The pediatrician believes the boy has a bladder infection with a double-stranded DNA virus. Which of the following conditions is also commonly associated with this viral infection?
Options:
(A): Gastroenteritis
(B): Painful dermatomal vesicles
(C): Lymphadenopathy
(D): Vesicular rash
(E): Plantar warts
",Gastroenteritis,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Gastroenteritis.

Explanation:
The presence of a double-stranded DNA virus in the bladder infection suggests that the most likely viral infection is adenovirus. Adenovirus is commonly associated with gastroenteritis, which is inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Gastroenteritis can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, which may explain the child's symptoms of lower abdominal pain and bloating. Therefore, option (A) Gastroenteritis is the correct answer. 

Painful dermatomal vesicles (option B) are typically associated with herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Lymphadenopathy (option C) refers to enlarged lymph nodes and is not commonly associated with adenovirus infection. Vesicular rash (option D) can be seen in various viral infections, but it is not specifically associated with adenovirus. Plantar warts (option E) are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and are not commonly associated with adenovirus infection.",
"A 46-year-old woman presents with difficulty initiating sleep, as well as frequent nighttime awakenings. She reports making multiple mistakes at her office job, has an inability to concentrate, and feels sleepy throughout the day. She is worried that her sleeping troubles will cause her to get fired. Which of the following would best treat this patient’s insomnia pharmacologically?
Options:
(A): Citalopram
(B): Chlordiazepoxide
(C): Triazolam
(D): Diazepam
(E): Modafinil
",Triazolam,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Triazolam.

Explanation:
Triazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is commonly used to treat insomnia. It acts by enhancing the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity. Triazolam helps to reduce the time it takes to fall asleep and increases total sleep time. It is particularly effective for patients who have difficulty initiating sleep, as well as frequent nighttime awakenings.

In this case, the patient is experiencing difficulty initiating sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings, which are classic symptoms of insomnia. Additionally, she reports making multiple mistakes at her office job, an inability to concentrate, and feeling sleepy throughout the day. These symptoms are consistent with the consequences of poor sleep quality and quantity.

Citalopram, an antidepressant, is not the best choice for treating insomnia in this patient. While it may help with mood symptoms, it is not specifically indicated for insomnia.

Chlordiazepoxide and diazepam are both benzodiazepines, but they have longer half-lives compared to triazolam. They are typically used for anxiety and may cause residual sedation the next day, which could further impair the patient's ability to concentrate and perform well at her job.

Modafinil is a wakefulness-promoting agent and is not indicated for the treatment of insomnia. It is used to treat excessive sleepiness associated with narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and shift work sleep disorder.

Therefore, triazolam would be the best pharmacological treatment option for this patient's insomnia. However, it is important to consider non-pharmacological interventions as well, such as sleep hygiene education and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).",
"A 5-year-old girl is brought to her pediatrician for evaluation of difficulties noted at school. Her kindergarten teacher voiced her concern that the child ‘spaces out’ often and thinks she may have ADHD. The parents deny any history of head trauma or infection. Her blood pressure is 106/74 mm Hg, the heart rate is 69/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. Physical exam demonstrates a happy child who has reached developmental milestones. Laboratory results are within normal limits. EEG demonstrates a 3-Hz spike and wave pattern (see image). The decision is made to start the child on medical therapy. What should be advised to the parents as a potential side effect of the first-line medication?
Options:
(A): Nystagmus
(B): GI upset
(C): Facial rash and blood in the urine
(D): Profound leukopenia increasing the risk for severe infection
(E): Weight gain and change in hair color
",GI upset,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) GI upset.

Explanation:
When starting a child on medical therapy for ADHD, it is important to inform the parents about potential side effects of the medication. The most common side effect of the first-line medication for ADHD is gastrointestinal (GI) upset. This can include symptoms such as stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It is important for parents to be aware of these potential side effects so that they can monitor their child and report any concerning symptoms to the pediatrician. Other potential side effects of ADHD medications include decreased appetite, insomnia, irritability, and headache. However, GI upset is the most common side effect and should be discussed with the parents.",
"A 75-year-old man comes to the physician for the evaluation of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue over the past month. He reports that he cannot climb more than one flight of stairs without experiencing shortness of breath and dizziness. He has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 50 years. He does not drink alcohol. His medications include enalapril, atorvastatin, and low-dose aspirin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg. Physical examination shows weak peripheral pulses. Cardiac examination is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Aortic valve regurgitation
(B): Tricuspid valve stenosis
(C): Mitral valve prolapse
(D): Mitral valve stenosis
(E): Aortic valve stenosis
",Aortic valve stenosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Aortic valve stenosis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of progressive shortness of breath and fatigue, as well as the physical examination findings of weak peripheral pulses, the most likely diagnosis is aortic valve stenosis.

Aortic valve stenosis is a condition characterized by narrowing of the aortic valve, which obstructs blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. This obstruction leads to increased pressure in the left ventricle and decreased cardiac output, resulting in symptoms such as shortness of breath and fatigue.

The patient's risk factors for aortic valve stenosis include age (75 years old), hypertension, and smoking history. Hypertension and smoking are known risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to calcification and narrowing of the aortic valve.

The physical examination findings of weak peripheral pulses are consistent with decreased cardiac output, which can occur in aortic valve stenosis.

The other options (Aortic valve regurgitation, Tricuspid valve stenosis, Mitral valve prolapse, and Mitral valve stenosis) are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",
"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up examination 1 week after a temporal artery biopsy was performed to evaluate headache and blurry vision. He has a 12-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Results of the testing show decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this finding?
Options:
(A): Increased binding of calcium to calmodulin
(B): Increased phosphorylation of myosin
(C): Increased production of nitric oxide
(D): Decreased production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(E): Decreased concentration of bradykinin
",Increased production of nitric oxide,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Increased production of nitric oxide.

Explanation:
The decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells suggest a deficiency in the substrate required for nitric oxide production. Nitric oxide is synthesized from arginine by the enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Therefore, a decrease in arginine levels would result in a decrease in nitric oxide production.

Nitric oxide is an important signaling molecule that plays a key role in regulating vascular tone and blood pressure. It acts by stimulating the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. This helps to maintain normal blood flow and prevent hypertension.

Lisinopril, the medication the patient is taking for hypertension, is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. By inhibiting angiotensin II production, ACE inhibitors promote vasodilation and decrease blood pressure.

In this case, the decreased concentrations of arginine in vascular endothelial cells are likely due to the inhibition of ACE by lisinopril. ACE is responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin, a peptide that stimulates the release of nitric oxide. Therefore, ACE inhibitors can increase the production of nitric oxide by preventing the breakdown of bradykinin.

Overall, the most likely explanation for the decreased concentrations of arginine in this patient is the increased production of nitric oxide, as a result of ACE inhibition by lisinopril.",
"While traveling abroad a physician is asked to attend a meeting regarding healthcare in the region. The rate of chlamydial infection is exceptionally high in the area, and the local government is wanting to test a new treatment for these infections. To test the new therapy, the physician is asked to oversee the operations of testing this new treatment. When asking what this would entail, the officials tell the physician that they plan to infect the local prison population with chlamydia and then test the new treatment on these individuals. Which of the following is the best response from the physician?
Options:
(A): “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of autonomy.”
(B): “I will accept your proposal.”
(C): “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of justice.”
(D): “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.”
(E): “I can not help you due to the ethical principle of beneficence.”
",“I can not help you due to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.”,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) ""I can not help you due to the ethical principle of nonmaleficence.""

Explanation:
The ethical principle of nonmaleficence states that healthcare professionals have a duty to do no harm to their patients. In this scenario, infecting the local prison population with chlamydia for the purpose of testing a new treatment would clearly violate this principle. Intentionally causing harm to individuals, even if it is for the purpose of testing a potential treatment, is unethical and goes against the core principles of medical ethics. Therefore, the physician should refuse to oversee the operations and testing of this new treatment.",
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 7-day history of progressively worsening shortness of breath. She has a history of asthma and has frequent exacerbations despite receiving maximal medical therapy. Physical examination shows scattered expiratory wheezing. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 9,800/mm3 (13% eosinophils) and elevated serum concentration of immunoglobulin E. An x-ray of the chest shows thickened bronchial walls and perihilar opacities. Sputum culture shows scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees. Which of the following is most likely to be increased in this patient?
Options:
(A): IL-28
(B): C5a
(C): TGF-β
(D): IFN-α
(E): IL-4
",IL-4,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) IL-4.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), which is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus fumigatus. ABPA is characterized by asthma, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels. The presence of scattered septate hyphae that branch at 45 degrees on sputum culture is suggestive of Aspergillus infection. IL-4 is a cytokine that plays a key role in the pathogenesis of ABPA. It promotes the production of IgE and eosinophilia, which are characteristic features of ABPA. Therefore, IL-4 is most likely to be increased in this patient.",
"A 29-year-old G1P0 female presents at 22 weeks gestation for her first prenatal care appointment. Physical exam demonstrates a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and taut, shiny skin with scattered striae on her abdomen. Ultrasound examination of the fetus reveals 2.5 L of amniotic fluid (normal 1.5-2.0 L) with an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34 (normal AFI 20-25). Which of the following fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions could have contributed to these abnormal ultrasound findings?
Options:
(A): Renal agenesis
(B): Pulmonary hypoplasia
(C): Duodenal atresia
(D): Posterior urethral valve
(E): Polycystic kidney disease
",Duodenal atresia,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Duodenal atresia.

Explanation:
Polyhydramnios, which is an excessive accumulation of amniotic fluid, can be caused by various fetal abnormalities or dysfunctions. In this case, the patient presents with a uterine size greater than expected for her gestational age and an amniotic fluid index (AFI) of 34, which is above the normal range of 20-25. These findings suggest polyhydramnios.

Duodenal atresia is a condition where there is a blockage or narrowing of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine. This can lead to an accumulation of fluid in the stomach and intestines, which can then be swallowed by the fetus and contribute to polyhydramnios. The excess fluid is then excreted by the fetus as urine, leading to increased amniotic fluid volume.

Renal agenesis, pulmonary hypoplasia, posterior urethral valve, and polycystic kidney disease are all conditions that can cause oligohydramnios, which is a decreased amount of amniotic fluid. These conditions would not be expected to cause polyhydramnios.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the abnormal ultrasound findings in this case is duodenal atresia.",
"A 68-year-old woman presents to the emergency room with chest pain. She reports sudden severe and crushing substernal chest pain that started 1 hour ago. Her past medical history is notable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and a prior myocardial infarction requiring a coronary artery bypass graft 2 years ago. She takes aspirin, metoprolol, lisinopril, spironolactone, atorvastatin, and insulin. She is retired and lives a sedentary lifestyle at home. Her temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 109/68 mmHg, pulse is 118/min, and respirations are 24/min. Before being able to start the physical examination, the patient loses consciousness. Her pulse is palpable but weak. Her blood pressure is now 88/50 mmHg and pulse is 130/min. Her skin is pale, cold, and clammy. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevations in leads I, aVL, V3, V4, V5, and V6. A medication that primarily stimulates which of the following receptors would be most appropriate to improve the hemodynamic status of this patient?
Options:
(A): Alpha-1 adrenergic receptor
(B): Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor
(C): Beta-1 adrenergic receptor
(D): Beta-2 adrenergic receptor
(E): D2 receptor
",Beta-1 adrenergic receptor,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Beta-1 adrenergic receptor.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). The ST elevations on the electrocardiogram indicate myocardial ischemia and injury. The patient's loss of consciousness, weak pulse, and low blood pressure suggest cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening complication of myocardial infarction.

To improve the hemodynamic status of this patient, a medication that primarily stimulates the beta-1 adrenergic receptor would be most appropriate. Stimulation of the beta-1 adrenergic receptor increases cardiac contractility, heart rate, and systemic vascular resistance, leading to improved cardiac output and blood pressure.

Options A and B, which involve stimulation of the alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, respectively, would primarily cause vasoconstriction and may further decrease blood flow to the myocardium, worsening the patient's condition.

Option D, which involves stimulation of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor, primarily causes vasodilation and bronchodilation. While beta-2 agonists may be used in certain situations, such as in the treatment of asthma, they are not the most appropriate choice in this patient with cardiogenic shock.

Option E, which involves stimulation of the D2 receptor, is not relevant to the management of cardiogenic shock in this patient.

Therefore, the most appropriate choice is (C) Beta-1 adrenergic receptor.",
"A 4-year-old child is rushed to the emergency department after developing sudden abdominal pain followed by nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool. Prior to the onset of symptoms, he was seen playing with his mother’s purse containing a bottle of vitamin supplements, which she takes for chronic microcytic anemia. Which of the following medications is the treatment for this patient's intoxication?
Options:
(A): Dimercaprol
(B): Penicillamine
(C): Deferoxamine
(D): Protamine
(E): Succimer
",Deferoxamine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Deferoxamine.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the scenario, including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and dark, almost black-colored stool, are consistent with iron poisoning. Iron supplements, such as the vitamin supplements the child was playing with, can be toxic if ingested in large amounts.

Deferoxamine is the treatment of choice for iron poisoning. It is a chelating agent that binds to iron and promotes its excretion from the body. It is administered intravenously and helps to prevent further absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract.

Dimercaprol (A) is a chelating agent used for the treatment of heavy metal poisoning, such as lead or mercury poisoning. It is not the appropriate treatment for iron poisoning.

Penicillamine (B) is also a chelating agent, but it is primarily used for the treatment of copper or gold poisoning. It is not the appropriate treatment for iron poisoning.

Protamine (D) is a medication used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparin. It is not the appropriate treatment for iron poisoning.

Succimer (E) is a chelating agent used for the treatment of lead poisoning. It is not the appropriate treatment for iron poisoning.",
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, breast tenderness, increased urinary frequency, and intermittent nausea for 2 weeks. Her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. She has a history of a seizure disorder treated with carbamazepine. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is positive. The child is at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Renal dysplasia
(B): Meningocele
(C): Teeth discoloration
(D): Sensorineural hearing loss
(E): Vaginal clear cell carcinoma
",Meningocele,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Meningocele.

Explanation:
The woman in the scenario is pregnant and has been taking carbamazepine, which is an anticonvulsant medication. Carbamazepine is known to increase the risk of neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Meningocele is a type of neural tube defect where the protective covering of the spinal cord (meninges) protrudes through a defect in the spinal column. This can lead to various complications, including paralysis and infection. Therefore, the child is at greatest risk of developing meningocele as a complication of the mother's use of carbamazepine during pregnancy. 

Renal dysplasia (A) is a congenital malformation of the kidneys, but it is not associated with the use of carbamazepine during pregnancy. Teeth discoloration (C) is a side effect of certain antibiotics, not carbamazepine. Sensorineural hearing loss (D) is not specifically associated with carbamazepine use during pregnancy. Vaginal clear cell carcinoma (E) is a rare type of cancer that is associated with exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero, not carbamazepine.",
"Three patients present to the pediatrician for routine well-child visits. The first child’s mother reports that he seems to be breastfeeding well and voids at least eight times per day. His stools are a yellow color, and he does not seem to be straining. In the office, he can lift his head and chest when in the prone position, and he can track an object with his eyes to the midline. His hands remain fisted 50% of the time.

The second child’s parents report that she is doing well at home and seems to enjoy playing with her older brother. In the office, she can roll from supine to prone and can transfer her rattle from hand to hand. She cannot yet say any words.

The third child’s father reports that he is starting to explore the world around him. He has begun taking independent steps at home. In the office, he seems to recognize the name of several objects, but he cannot follow the direction to “grab the ball.” All three children are assessed as developmentally normal.

Which of the following represents these patient's respective ages?
Options:
(A): Ages 1 month, 4 months, and 9 months
(B): Ages 1 month, 6 months, and 9 months
(C): Ages 2 months, 4 months, and 12 months
(D): Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 9 months
(E): Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months
","Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months",Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Ages 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, we can determine the ages of the three children as follows:

The first child is breastfeeding well, voiding at least eight times per day, and has yellow stools without straining. He can lift his head and chest when in the prone position and can track an object with his eyes to the midline. These developmental milestones are typically seen in infants around 2 months of age.

The second child can roll from supine to prone and can transfer her rattle from hand to hand. However, she cannot yet say any words. These developmental milestones are typically seen in infants around 6 months of age.

The third child has started taking independent steps at home and seems to recognize the name of several objects. However, he cannot follow the direction to ""grab the ball."" These developmental milestones are typically seen in infants around 12 months of age.

Therefore, the respective ages of the three children are 2 months, 6 months, and 12 months.",
"A 75-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with 30 minutes of slurred speech and arm weakness. On the drive over to the hospital, her symptoms have resolved completely. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, morbid obesity, gout, and vascular claudication. Her temperature is 99.0°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 184/111 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals cranial nerves II-XII as grossly intact with normal strength and sensation in the patient's upper and lower extremities. The patient's memory is intact and her speech seems normal and fluent. Her gait is stable with no ataxia. An initial head CT demonstrates diffuse atrophy which is consistent with previous head CT scans. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Alteplase
(B): CT angiogram
(C): Echocardiogram
(D): Heparin
(E): MRI
",CT angiogram,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) CT angiogram.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of slurred speech and arm weakness that resolved completely within 30 minutes is consistent with a transient ischemic attack (TIA). TIAs are often caused by temporary disruption of blood flow to a specific part of the brain, which can be a warning sign of an impending stroke. Given the patient's history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and vascular disease, it is important to evaluate for any underlying vascular pathology that may have caused the TIA.

A CT angiogram is the best next step in management because it can provide detailed imaging of the blood vessels in the brain and neck, allowing for the identification of any stenosis, occlusions, or other abnormalities that may have contributed to the TIA. This information is crucial for determining the appropriate management and prevention strategies for the patient.

Alteplase (A) is a thrombolytic medication used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. However, since the patient's symptoms have resolved completely, alteplase is not indicated at this time.

An echocardiogram (C) may be useful in evaluating the patient's atrial fibrillation and assessing for any cardiac sources of emboli. However, given the patient's presentation and history, a CT angiogram would be a more appropriate initial step.

Heparin (D) is an anticoagulant medication that may be used in the management of acute ischemic stroke or TIA. However, without further information or confirmation of a specific etiology, it would not be the best next step in this case.

An MRI (E) may provide more detailed imaging of the brain and can be useful in evaluating for any structural abnormalities or ischemic changes. However, a CT angiogram would be a more appropriate initial step in this case to evaluate for any vascular pathology.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with weakness. He states that it started yesterday and has been progressively worsening. Initially, he noticed blurry vision and some trouble speaking and swallowing but thought he was just coming down with a cold. He then noticed weakness of his facial muscles and shortness of breath. The patient works as a farmer and harvests and cans his own foods. He has had diarrhea recently and a cough prior to these symptoms of weakness. His temperature is 97.9°F (36.6°C), blood pressure is 144/94 mmHg, pulse is 87/min, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 94% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who seems unable to smile with dysarthric speech. He takes shallow and weak breaths on pulmonary exam. The patient demonstrates 3/5 strength with diminished reflexes in his upper extremities. The patient is subsequently intubated. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Antitoxin
(B): Atropine
(C): Neostigmine
(D): Plasmapheresis
(E): Riluzole
",Antitoxin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Antitoxin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is botulism. Botulism is a rare but serious illness caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. The symptoms of botulism include weakness, blurred vision, difficulty speaking and swallowing, facial muscle weakness, and shortness of breath. The patient's occupation as a farmer and recent diarrhea suggest that he may have been exposed to the bacteria through contaminated food.

The best treatment for botulism is administration of antitoxin. Antitoxin is derived from horse serum and works by neutralizing the botulinum toxin in the body. It is most effective when given early in the course of the illness, so prompt administration is crucial. Antitoxin can help prevent further progression of symptoms and improve the patient's chances of recovery.

Atropine (B) is not the best treatment for this patient. Atropine is a medication that can be used to treat certain symptoms of botulism, such as excessive sweating and drooling, but it does not address the underlying cause of the illness.

Neostigmine (C) is also not the best treatment for this patient. Neostigmine is a medication that can be used to increase muscle strength in certain conditions, but it is not effective in treating botulism.

Plasmapheresis (D) is a procedure that involves removing the patient's plasma (the liquid portion of the blood) and replacing it with donor plasma. It can be used in some cases of botulism to remove the toxin from the bloodstream, but it is not the best initial treatment option.

Riluzole (E) is a medication that is used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive neurodegenerative disease. It is not indicated for the treatment of botulism.

In summary, the best treatment for this patient with suspected botulism is administration of antitoxin.",
"A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of difficulty starting urination and a vague sensation of fullness in the pelvis. Pelvic speculum examination in the lithotomy position shows a pink structure at the vaginal introitus that protrudes from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient is asked to cough. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Uterine prolapse
(B): Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma
(C): Cystocele
(D): Rectocele
(E): Uterine leiomyomata
",Cystocele,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Cystocele.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on pelvic examination, the most likely cause of her symptoms is a cystocele. A cystocele is a type of pelvic organ prolapse where the bladder bulges into the anterior vaginal wall. This can cause difficulty with urination and a sensation of pelvic fullness. The pink structure seen at the vaginal introitus that protrudes from the anterior vaginal wall when the patient coughs is consistent with a cystocele. 

Uterine prolapse (choice A) refers to the descent or protrusion of the uterus into the vagina. While it can cause similar symptoms, such as a sensation of pelvic fullness, it would not present with a pink structure at the vaginal introitus.

Vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma (choice B) is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the muscle tissue in the vagina. It is highly unlikely in this elderly patient and would not present with the specific findings described.

Rectocele (choice D) refers to the bulging of the rectum into the posterior vaginal wall. This would not explain the pink structure seen at the vaginal introitus in this patient.

Uterine leiomyomata (choice E) are benign tumors of the uterus, also known as fibroids. While they can cause pelvic symptoms, they would not present with the specific findings described in this patient.",
"A 30-year-old woman presents to the physician because of ongoing diarrhea for the past 1 month. She reports that diarrhea has been intermittently present for the past month. The stool is often loose and associated with blood and lower abdominal pain. She denies any recent travel history, and she works at a nursing home as a caretaker. She is not currently on any medications. Clinical examination shows mild tenderness in the suprapubic region, and there is no organomegaly. Findings on colonoscopy include patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon. Mucosal biopsy shows colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Ulcerative colitis
(B): Crohn’s disease
(C): Acute infective colitis
(D): Pseudomembranous colitis
(E): Irritable bowel syndrome
",Crohn’s disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Crohn's disease.

Explanation:
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus. It is characterized by patchy inflammation and ulceration in the affected areas. In this case, the patient's symptoms of ongoing diarrhea, loose stool with blood, and lower abdominal pain are consistent with Crohn's disease. The presence of patchy erythema and ulceration in the cecum, ascending, descending, and sigmoid colon on colonoscopy further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the mucosal biopsy showing colonic crypts with lymphocytic and neutrophilic infiltrates is also consistent with Crohn's disease. 

Ulcerative colitis, another type of inflammatory bowel disease, typically involves continuous inflammation and ulceration limited to the colon and rectum, whereas Crohn's disease can involve any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Acute infective colitis is usually caused by an infection and is associated with a recent travel history, which the patient denies. Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by Clostridium difficile infection and is associated with antibiotic use, which the patient is not currently taking. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits, but it does not typically cause bloody diarrhea or mucosal inflammation seen in this patient.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95°F (35°C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80°F (26.7°C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation?
Options:
(A): Cardiac tamponade
(B): Cervical spinal cord transection
(C): Occult hemorrhage
(D): Pulmonary embolism
(E): Undiagnosed pneumonia
",Cardiac tamponade,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Cardiac tamponade.

Explanation:
Cardiac tamponade occurs when there is accumulation of fluid or blood in the pericardial sac, leading to compression of the heart and impaired cardiac function. In this patient, the extensive blood loss from the stab wounds could have resulted in the accumulation of blood in the pericardial sac, causing cardiac tamponade.

The patient's vital signs, including a low blood pressure (50/40 mmHg) and cold extremities, are consistent with decreased cardiac output due to impaired cardiac function. The low temperature (95°F or 35°C) may be a result of poor perfusion to the extremities.

The stat ScvO2 result of 39% indicates inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissues, despite the patient being on 100% oxygen. This is another sign of impaired cardiac function.

The absence of active blood loss reported by the surgical team suggests that the ongoing hemodynamic instability is not due to ongoing bleeding. This makes cardiac tamponade a more likely cause.

Cervical spinal cord transection, occult hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and undiagnosed pneumonia are less likely causes in this scenario, as they do not explain the combination of findings seen in the patient.",
"A 71-year-old woman presents to her physician accompanied by her son. She has no complaints, but her son states that the patient has impaired memory and poor orientation in space. She is ambulatory and is capable of self-care, but she tends to forget newly introduced information. Also, she got lost on the way from the home to the local market several times for the past 6 months, and her family is now afraid to let her go anywhere on her own. She does not have any concomitant chronic conditions nor did she have major cardiovascular events or head trauma. It is known that her father had dementia. The vital signs include: blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 62/min, respiratory rate is 11/min, and the temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F). The respiratory, cardiologic, and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. The neurological examination shows equal, round pupils with a normal reaction to light. The eye movements are normal with no nystagmus and normal oculocephalic reflex. There is no facial droop, the facial sensation is preserved, and there is no tongue deviation noted. There is no motor or sensory deficits on the upper and lower extremities. The patient scores 18 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Which of the following medications is indicated in the patient?
Options:
(A): Imipramine
(B): Sertraline
(C): Lithium
(D): Donepezil
(E): Sulpiride
",Donepezil,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Donepezil.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presents with impaired memory and poor orientation in space, which are suggestive of cognitive decline. Given her age and the presence of a family history of dementia, it is likely that she is experiencing symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia in older adults.

Donepezil is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called cholinesterase inhibitors. It is commonly used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease to improve cognitive function and slow down the progression of symptoms. Donepezil works by increasing the levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning, in the brain.

The patient's score of 18 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) suggests mild cognitive impairment, which is consistent with the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. Initiating treatment with donepezil can help improve her cognitive function and potentially delay the progression of her symptoms.

The other options (A) Imipramine, (B) Sertraline, (C) Lithium, and (E) Sulpiride are not indicated in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant, sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), lithium is a mood stabilizer, and sulpiride is an antipsychotic medication. While these medications may be used for other conditions, they are not the first-line treatment for Alzheimer's disease.",
"A 16-year-old teenager presents to the emergency department with a sudden onset of severe pain in his right knee. He describes the pain as the worst pain he has ever felt. He denies any recent trauma or injury to the knee. The joint appears red and swollen and is hot to the touch. He denies any lower extremity numbness. There is no family history of joint or connective tissue disorders. The teenager is otherwise healthy. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 124/82 mm Hg, respirations are 17/min, pulse is 104/min, and temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). On palpation of the affected joint, there is evidence of tenderness and capsular swelling; the joint is red and warm. Laboratory studies show increased serum CRP and procalcitonin levels. Which of the following will most likely found with analysis of his synovial fluid?
Options:
(A): WBC/mm3 1,600; % PMN > 25%; Viscosity N
(B): WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low
(C): WBC/mm3 160; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity high
(D): WBC/mm3 2,400; % PMN < 20%; Viscosity low
(E): WBC/mm3 45,000; % PMN > 50%; Viscosity N
","WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): WBC/mm3 53,000; % PMN > 75%; Viscosity low.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a sudden onset of severe pain, redness, swelling, and warmth in the knee, along with systemic symptoms such as fever and increased inflammatory markers (elevated CRP and procalcitonin levels), suggests an acute infectious arthritis. The most likely finding with analysis of the synovial fluid in this case would be a high white blood cell count (WBC) with a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN). 

Option (B) is the correct answer because it describes a synovial fluid analysis consistent with an acute infectious arthritis. A WBC count of 53,000/mm3 with a PMN percentage greater than 75% indicates a significant inflammatory response and suggests an infectious etiology. The low viscosity of the synovial fluid is also consistent with inflammation.

Option (A) is incorrect because a WBC count of 1,600/mm3 with a PMN percentage greater than 25% is too low to be consistent with the severe inflammatory response seen in acute infectious arthritis.

Option (C) is incorrect because a WBC count of 160/mm3 with a PMN percentage less than 20% is too low to be consistent with the severe inflammatory response seen in acute infectious arthritis. Additionally, the viscosity of the synovial fluid is described as high, which is not typical in infectious arthritis.

Option (D) is incorrect because a WBC count of 2,400/mm3 with a PMN percentage less than 20% is too low to be consistent with the severe inflammatory response seen in acute infectious arthritis. Additionally, the viscosity of the synovial fluid is described as low, which is not typical in infectious arthritis.

Option (E) is incorrect because a WBC count of 45,000/mm3 with a PMN percentage greater than 50% is not consistent with the severe inflammatory response seen in acute infectious arthritis. Additionally, the viscosity of the synovial fluid is described as normal, which is not typical in infectious arthritis.",

A peripheral blood smear reveals spherocytes. The Coombs test is negative. The physical examination is remarkable for scleral icterus and moderate splenomegaly. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test of this patient’s underlying disorder?
Options:
(A): Eosin-5-maleimide binding test
(B): Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59
(C): Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies
(D): Bone marrow biopsy
(E): Liver function tests
",Eosin-5-maleimide binding test,Incorrect,"The correct answer is (B): Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59.

Explanation:
The patient's lab results and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, which is a genetic disorder characterized by the presence of spherocytes on peripheral blood smear, hemolytic anemia, and splenomegaly. In hereditary spherocytosis, there is a deficiency or dysfunction of proteins involved in the stability of the red blood cell membrane, leading to the formation of spherocytes.

Flow cytometry for CD55/CD59 is the most appropriate diagnostic test for hereditary spherocytosis. CD55 (decay-accelerating factor) and CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) are proteins that protect red blood cells from complement-mediated lysis. In hereditary spherocytosis, there is a deficiency of these proteins on the red blood cell membrane, making the cells more susceptible to complement-mediated lysis. Flow cytometry can detect the absence or reduced expression of CD55 and CD59 on the patient's red blood cells, confirming the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.

The other options are not appropriate diagnostic tests for hereditary spherocytosis:
(A) Eosin-5-maleimide binding test is used to diagnose hereditary spherocytosis caused by spectrin or ankyrin deficiencies, but it is not the most appropriate test in this case.
(C) Anti parvovirus B19 antibodies are not relevant to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.
(D) Bone marrow biopsy is not necessary for the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis and is not the most appropriate test in this case.
(E) Liver function tests are not relevant to the diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis.",
"A 39-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of personality changes over the past year. He has become increasingly irritable, loud, aggressive, and impulsive. His wife also reports jerky movements of his limbs and trunk for the past few months. His father had dementia in his mid-40s, but the details of his condition are unclear. The patient appears restless. Examination shows irregular movements of the extremities and twitching of the face and tongue. Mental status examination shows impaired memory. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following changes on MRI?
Options:
(A): Reduced hippocampal volume
(B): Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions
(C): Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes
(D): Extra-axial tumor with dural attachments
(E): Atrophy of the striatum
",Atrophy of the striatum,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Atrophy of the striatum.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of personality changes, jerky movements, and impaired memory are consistent with a diagnosis of Huntington's disease. Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive degeneration of the basal ganglia, particularly the striatum. The striatum is a part of the basal ganglia that is involved in motor control and cognition. Atrophy of the striatum can be visualized on MRI as a characteristic finding in patients with Huntington's disease. Reduced hippocampal volume (option A) is seen in conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, not Huntington's disease. Multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions (option B) would present with focal neurological deficits, which are not described in this patient. Degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes (option C) is seen in frontotemporal dementia, not Huntington's disease. An extra-axial tumor with dural attachments (option D) would present with focal neurological deficits and mass effect, which are not described in this patient.",
"A 45-year-old African-American woman comes to the physician after an episode of hemoptysis. Over the past 8 months, she has had a nonproductive cough, fatigue, and a 9-kg (20-lb) weight loss. She drinks a glass of wine every night and does not smoke. She has a history of hypertension and osteoarthritis. She does not take any medications. She has never traveled out of the country. She works as an accountant. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, and blood pressure is 130/90 mm Hg. Lungs are clear to auscultation. An x-ray of the chest shows a 2.5-cm nodule with irregular borders at the apex of the left lung with no mediastinal or hilar enlargement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Carcinoid tumor
(B): Small cell lung cancer
(C): Sarcoidosis
(D): Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
(E): Adenocarcinoma of the lung
",Adenocarcinoma of the lung,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the lung. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of lung cancer and is often associated with non-smokers. The patient's symptoms of nonproductive cough, fatigue, and weight loss are consistent with lung cancer. The presence of a nodule with irregular borders on the chest x-ray further supports this diagnosis. Adenocarcinoma typically arises in the periphery of the lung and can present as a solitary nodule, as seen in this patient. Other types of lung cancer, such as small cell lung cancer (B) and squamous cell carcinoma (D), are less likely given the patient's clinical history and imaging findings. Carcinoid tumors (A) are rare and typically present with symptoms related to hormone production. Sarcoidosis (C) is an inflammatory condition that can cause lung nodules, but it is less likely in this patient given her clinical presentation and lack of mediastinal or hilar enlargement on imaging.",
"A 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension returns to his cardiologist for ongoing blood pressure management. He reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications. He exercises regularly and sleeps well without snoring or daytime somnolence. His blood pressure measurements in the past have ranged from 160 - 170/80 - 100 mmHg. Today, his pressure is 150/100 mmHg with a pulse of 65/min while on hydrochlorothiazide and ramipril. Physical exam reveals a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 is appreciated at the right upper sternal border. There is unremarkable carotid, renal, or abdominal bruits. What is the most common cause of his hypertension?
Options:
(A): Primary hyperaldosteronism
(B): Hypothyroidism
(C): Stiffening of the aorta
(D): Obstructive sleep apnea
(E): Aortic stenosis
",Stiffening of the aorta,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Stiffening of the aorta.

Explanation:
In this case, the most common cause of the patient's hypertension is likely stiffening of the aorta. The patient is a 70-year-old man with hyperlipidemia and hypertension, which are both risk factors for atherosclerosis. Stiffening of the aorta is a common consequence of atherosclerosis and aging. As the aorta becomes stiffer, it loses its ability to expand and contract with each heartbeat, leading to increased systolic blood pressure. This is known as isolated systolic hypertension, which is commonly seen in older adults.

The physical exam findings of a II/VI early systolic murmur with split S2 at the right upper sternal border are consistent with aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis is a common cause of a systolic murmur and can also contribute to hypertension. However, in this case, the patient's blood pressure measurements have been consistently elevated in the past, suggesting that the hypertension is not solely due to the aortic stenosis.

Primary hyperaldosteronism is a condition characterized by excessive production of aldosterone by the adrenal glands, leading to increased sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion. This can result in hypertension. However, there are no clinical findings or history suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism in this patient.

Hypothyroidism can cause hypertension, but it is not the most common cause in this case. The patient reports feeling fine with no trouble with his medications, and there are no other clinical findings or history suggestive of hypothyroidism.

Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with hypertension, but the patient denies snoring or daytime somnolence, which are common symptoms of sleep apnea. Additionally, there are no other clinical findings or history suggestive of sleep apnea in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hypertension in this case is stiffening of the aorta, which is commonly seen in older adults with atherosclerosis.",
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. He is growing along with the 75th percentile and meeting all milestones. Physical examination shows a poorly rugated scrotum. The palpation of the scrotum shows only 1 testicle. A 2nd testicle is palpated in the inguinal canal. The examination of the penis shows a normal urethral meatus. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Chorionic gonadotropin therapy
(B): Exploratory laparoscopy
(C): Follow-up examination in 6 months
(D): Orchiectomy
(E): Orchiopexy
",Orchiopexy,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Orchiopexy.

Explanation:
The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is orchiopexy. Orchiopexy is a surgical procedure used to reposition undescended or ectopic testes that are palpable. It involves freeing the testis and cord from surrounding attachments, manipulating the testis into the scrotum, and suturing it in place. The procedure is typically performed through an inguinal and/or scrotal incision. Orchiopexy is the recommended treatment for palpable undescended testes and has a high success rate.

In this case, the physical examination findings indicate that the patient has one testicle in the scrotum and a second testicle palpable in the inguinal canal. This is consistent with cryptorchidism, which is the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum. Orchiopexy is the appropriate next step because it allows for the repositioning of the undescended testicle into the scrotum, which is important for normal testicular development and function. Delaying treatment or not treating the condition can lead to potential complications such as infertility and an increased risk of testicular cancer.

The other options are not appropriate in this case:
(A) Chorionic gonadotropin therapy is not indicated for the management of cryptorchidism. Chorionic gonadotropin therapy may be used in certain cases of undescended testes, but it is typically reserved for cases where the testes are non-palpable or have failed to descend after the age of 6 months.
(B) Exploratory laparoscopy is not necessary in this case because the testicle is palpable in the inguinal canal. Exploratory laparoscopy is typically reserved for cases where the testes are non-palpable and abdominal or intra-abdominal in location.
(C) Follow-up examination in 6 months is not appropriate because the patient already has a confirmed diagnosis of cryptorchidism. Prompt treatment with orchiopexy is recommended to prevent potential complications.
(D) Orchiectomy, or removal of the testicle, is not indicated in this case. Orchiectomy is typically reserved for cases where the testes are non-palpable or atrophic (usually due to prenatal testicular torsion).",
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of 1-day history of nausea and weakness. She has no history of serious illness. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses an oral contraceptive; she uses condoms inconsistently. Her last menstrual period was 4 days ago. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 88/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows right costovertebral angle tenderness. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 14 g/dL
Leukocyte count 13,000/mm3
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Serum
Urea nitrogen 18 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Glucose 95 mg/dL
C-reactive protein 16.4 mg/L (N=0.08–3.1)
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Urinalysis
(B): Cervical swab
(C): Abdominal ultrasound
(D): Blood culture
(E): CT scan of the abdomen
""
",Urinalysis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Urinalysis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of nausea, weakness, and right costovertebral angle tenderness, along with the laboratory findings of leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein, are suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI). The most appropriate next step in management is to perform a urinalysis to confirm the diagnosis of UTI. A urinalysis will show the presence of leukocytes and nitrites, which are indicative of a bacterial infection. It will also provide information about the presence of red blood cells and bacteria in the urine. If the urinalysis confirms the diagnosis of UTI, the patient can be started on appropriate antibiotic therapy. Cervical swab, abdominal ultrasound, blood culture, and CT scan of the abdomen are not indicated in the initial management of a suspected UTI.",
"A 65-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine bone mineral density screening. She does not have any children. Menopause was at age 55. Her mother died of breast cancer at the age of 48 years. She has hypertension for which she takes ramipril. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at the femoral neck shows a T-score of -2.7 SD. The physician considers treatment with raloxifene. This medication would put her at increased risk of developing which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Pulmonary embolism
(B): Cellulitis
(C): Breast cancer
(D): Mandibular osteonecrosis
(E): Hypercholesterolemia
",Pulmonary embolism,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Pulmonary embolism.

Explanation:
Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), is commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, it is important to note that raloxifene is associated with an increased risk of developing pulmonary embolism. This risk is similar to that seen with estrogen-progestin use. Therefore, in this patient with a history of hypertension and a family history of breast cancer, raloxifene may not be the best choice of treatment due to the increased risk of pulmonary embolism.",
"A multi-specialty physician practice is meeting to determine which compensation scheme would best serve the practice and its patient population. Which of the following are true in regards to physician compensation?
Options:
(A): Capitation poses the least financial risk to physicians
(B): Fee-for-service pays physicians a set amount of money per unit time for every patient under their care
(C): Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality
(D): Fee-for-service poses the most amount of financial risk to physicians
(E): Capitation may provide perverse incentives to decrease preventive medicine visits
",Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Fee-for-service may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization irrespective of quality.

Explanation:
Fee-for-service compensation pays physicians a set amount of money per service or procedure they provide. This payment model may incentivize physicians to increase healthcare utilization, as they are financially rewarded for each service they perform. This can lead to overutilization of healthcare services, regardless of the quality or necessity of the care provided. In contrast, capitation, which is not mentioned in the options, provides a fixed payment per patient per year and may incentivize physicians to limit medical services to control costs. Therefore, option (C) is the correct choice as it accurately describes the potential incentive of fee-for-service compensation.",
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor for a prenatal visit. She has just learned that she is pregnant and estimates she is approximately 6 weeks pregnant given the timing of her last menstrual cycle. She has a history of recurrent fetal loss. In total, she has had 4 miscarriages between the gestational ages of 8 and 15 weeks. She has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and has had several DVTs in the past and a clot in her lung once. Her vitals today are unremarkable. She is asking if there are any treatments she should receive to prevent fetal loss. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Aspirin
(B): Aspirin and heparin
(C): Aspirin and warfarin
(D): No treatment indicated
(E): Rivaroxaban
",Aspirin and heparin,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Aspirin and heparin.

Explanation:
This patient has a history of recurrent fetal loss, systemic lupus erythematosus, and a history of DVTs and a clot in her lung. These factors put her at high risk for thrombosis and subsequent fetal loss. The most appropriate management for this patient is the combination of aspirin and heparin.

Aspirin is recommended for individuals at high risk of preeclampsia or with antiphospholipid antibodies. It helps to reduce the risk of blood clots and improve blood flow to the placenta.

Heparin, specifically low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), is frequently offered to women with unexplained recurrent miscarriage. It helps to prevent blood clots and improve blood flow to the placenta. Trials have shown no benefit to LMWH treatment in women without an inherited thrombophilia, but in this case, the patient has a history of DVTs and a clot in her lung, which indicates a need for anticoagulation therapy.

Warfarin is contraindicated in pregnancy as it can cause fetal abnormalities. Rivaroxaban is also not recommended in pregnancy due to limited safety data.

Therefore, the most appropriate management for this patient is the combination of aspirin and heparin to prevent fetal loss and reduce the risk of thrombosis.",
"A 17-year-old girl is brought to the physician because she has not attained menarche. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 168 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 63 kg (139 lb); BMI is 22.3 kg/m2. Examination shows normal breast development. Scant axillary hair is present. Abdominal examination shows a firm, nontender left inguinal mass. Pelvic examination shows a blind vaginal pouch. Ultrasonography does not show a uterus or ovaries. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Mullerian duct agenesis
(B): 5-α reductase deficiency
(C): Sex chromosome mosaicism
(D): Sex chromosome monosomy
(E): Androgen insensitivity
",Androgen insensitivity,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Androgen insensitivity.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS), which is caused by a mutation in the androgen receptor gene (AR) on the X chromosome. CAIS is an X-linked recessive disorder that affects individuals with a 46,XY karyotype. In CAIS, the androgen receptor is defective, leading to a lack of response to androgens, including testosterone. As a result, individuals with CAIS have normal female external genitalia and breast development, but they lack a uterus and ovaries. The presence of a blind vaginal pouch on pelvic examination is a characteristic finding in CAIS. Additionally, individuals with CAIS typically have scant or absent axillary and pubic hair due to the lack of androgen stimulation. The firm, nontender left inguinal mass seen on abdominal examination is likely a testis that failed to descend into the scrotum. This is a common finding in CAIS, as the testes develop normally but are unable to respond to androgens and therefore do not descend.",
"A 68-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of worsening fatigue and weight loss. He is especially concerned about a recent episode in which he noticed a blurring of his vision and headache; he also notes that his “memory is not as good as it used to be,” which his wife confirms. Physical exam is notable only for pallor and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal anemia as well as an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM; serum IgM concentration is 6.3 g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?
Options:
(A): IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
(B): Multiple myeloma
(C): Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia
(D): Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(E): Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
",Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presents with symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, blurring of vision, headache, and memory impairment. Physical exam findings include pallor and general weakness. Laboratory studies reveal anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) reveals a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM, with a serum IgM concentration of 6.3 g/dL.

Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia is a rare type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma characterized by the presence of a monoclonal IgM protein. The symptoms and laboratory findings in this case are consistent with Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and neurologic symptoms (blurring of vision and memory impairment) are commonly seen in Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia. Anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are also common findings. The presence of a sharp, narrow spike of monoclonal IgM on serum protein electrophoresis confirms the diagnosis.

IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a benign condition characterized by the presence of a monoclonal IgM protein, but it does not typically cause symptoms or laboratory abnormalities. Multiple myeloma is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein (usually IgG or IgA) and is associated with lytic bone lesions, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and anemia. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are not typically associated with the presence of a monoclonal IgM protein.",
"A 73-year-old woman is brought to the physician by her daughter for evaluation of impaired memory and word-finding difficulties for 2 years. She was recently asked to step down from her position as volunteer accountant for a local charity organization because she was no longer able to coordinate her tasks. She reports that she has become unable to taste or smell her food. Two years later, the patient dies. At autopsy, examination of the brain shows generalized cortical atrophy. A photomicrograph of a section of the brain is shown. The inclusions indicated by the arrows are predominantly composed of which of the following substances?
Options:
(A): Alpha-synuclein
(B): Viral ribonuclear proteins
(C): Amyloid-β
(D): Hyperphosphorylated tau
(E): Prion protein
",Hyperphosphorylated tau,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Hyperphosphorylated tau.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of impaired memory and word-finding difficulties, along with the progression to inability to coordinate tasks, is suggestive of a neurodegenerative disorder. The presence of generalized cortical atrophy on autopsy further supports this diagnosis. The photomicrograph showing inclusions in the brain indicates the presence of abnormal protein aggregates.

Hyperphosphorylated tau is a characteristic finding in Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes microtubules in neurons. In Alzheimer's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, which are the inclusions seen in the brain.

Alpha-synuclein is associated with Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease, but it is not the predominant protein found in the inclusions seen in Alzheimer's disease.

Viral ribonuclear proteins are not associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

Amyloid-β is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, but it forms extracellular plaques, not the intracellular neurofibrillary tangles seen in this case.

Prion protein is associated with prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, but it is not the predominant protein found in the inclusions seen in Alzheimer's disease.",
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a change in his skin color. The patient went on a long hike this morning, and his girlfriend noticed that his skin had changed color when they were driving home. The patient has a past medical history of marijuana use, IV drug use, alcohol use, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, fluticasone, and ibuprofen. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 120/75 mmHg, pulse is 60/min, respirations are 10/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory studies are ordered and are seen below.

Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL
Hematocrit: 32%
Leukocyte count: 5,500 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 207,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 99 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
BUN: 17 mg/dL
Glucose: 89 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.1 mg/dL
Bilirubin, total: 11.3 mg/dL
Bilirubin, direct: 7.8 mg/dL

Physical exam is notable for a patient with skin that appears yellow/orange. Cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, and neurological exams are within normal limits. Which of the following is associated with this patient's underlying pathology?
Options:
(A): A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir
(B): Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity
(C): Hyperpigmentation of the liver
(D): Increased consumption of beta-carotene
(E): Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT
",Hyperpigmentation of the liver,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Hyperpigmentation of the liver.

Explanation:
The patient's yellow/orange skin color is indicative of jaundice, which is caused by an accumulation of bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. It is normally processed by the liver and excreted in the bile. However, in this patient, there is likely a dysfunction in the liver that is causing the accumulation of bilirubin.

The laboratory findings also support liver dysfunction. The total bilirubin level is elevated at 11.3 mg/dL, and the direct bilirubin level is also elevated at 7.8 mg/dL. This suggests that there is impaired excretion of bilirubin by the liver.

The other answer choices are not associated with the patient's underlying pathology:
(A) A pathology responsive to sofosbuvir: Sofosbuvir is a medication used to treat hepatitis C, but there is no indication in the patient's history or laboratory findings to suggest hepatitis C infection.
(B) Decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity: UDP-glucuronyl transferase is an enzyme involved in the conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. Decreased activity of this enzyme can lead to impaired bilirubin metabolism and jaundice. However, there is no information in the question stem to suggest decreased UDP-glucuronyl transferase activity.
(D) Increased consumption of beta-carotene: Beta-carotene is a pigment found in fruits and vegetables that can cause a yellow/orange discoloration of the skin when consumed in large amounts. However, the patient's history and laboratory findings do not suggest increased consumption of beta-carotene as the cause of his symptoms.
(E) Increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT: The patient's liver enzymes are not provided in the laboratory findings, so there is no information to suggest increased liver enzymes with AST > ALT.",
"A 40-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with severe left upper quadrant pain (duration 3 hours, stabbing quality, 10/10 on the pain scale). Past medical history is significant for sickle cell anemia. Physical examination is significant for severe tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Significant splenomegaly is also noted. The patient is admitted to the hospital for close observation and placed on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis as part of a routine protocol. Laboratory findings drawn sometime after admission demonstrate a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). Which of the following factors is most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis?
Options:
(A): VII
(B): XIIa
(C): VIIa
(D): X
(E): XII
",X,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) X.

Explanation:
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis is aimed at preventing the formation of blood clots in the deep veins, typically in the lower extremities. The laboratory findings in this patient show a normal prothrombin time (PT) and elevated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). 

The PT measures the extrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which is primarily dependent on factors VII, X, V, and II. Since the PT is normal, it suggests that the extrinsic pathway is not affected by the DVT prophylaxis.

The PTT measures the intrinsic pathway of the coagulation cascade, which is primarily dependent on factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, X, V, and II. The elevated PTT suggests that one or more of these factors are affected by the DVT prophylaxis.

Among the options given, factor X is the most directly affected by the DVT prophylaxis. Factor X is a key component of both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, and its deficiency or inhibition can lead to prolonged PTT. Therefore, the elevated PTT in this patient suggests that the DVT prophylaxis is affecting factor X.",
"A 47-year-old man with a history of HIV1 infection presents to his HIV clinic to discuss his antiretroviral medications. He is interested in including maraviroc in his maintenance regimen after seeing advertisements about the medication. On exam, his temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 116/74 mmHg, pulse is 64/min, and respirations are 12/min. His viral load is undetectable on his current regimen, and his blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests have all been within normal limits. In order to consider maraviroc for therapy, a tropism assay needs to be performed. Which of the following receptors is affected by the use of maraviroc?
Options:
(A): gp41
(B): gp120
(C): gp160
(D): p24
(E): Reverse transcriptase
",gp120,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) gp120.

Explanation:
Maraviroc is a CCR5 antagonist, which means it blocks the CCR5 receptor on the surface of CD4+ T cells. The HIV virus uses the gp120 protein on its envelope to bind to the CD4 receptor and then to the CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor to enter the host cell. By blocking the CCR5 receptor, maraviroc prevents the virus from entering the CD4+ T cells that use the CCR5 co-receptor for entry. Therefore, a tropism assay is necessary before considering maraviroc therapy to determine if the patient's virus utilizes the CCR5 co-receptor. If the virus uses the CXCR4 co-receptor instead, maraviroc would not be effective.",
"A 16-year-old female presents to her physician’s office after noticing a round lump in her left breast 2 months ago. She reports that the lump seemed to enlarge and became tender just preceding her last 2 menses. It is otherwise painless, and the patient denies any discharge or skin changes. She has no past medical history but her grandmother, age 72, was just diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The patient is an avid softball player at her high school and denies alcohol, smoking, or illicit drug use. On exam, the breasts appear symmetric and normal. A 3-cm round, mobile mass is palpated in the upper outer quadrant of the left breast. There is slight tenderness to deep palpation of the mass. There is no axillary lymphadenopathy on either side. Which of the following is the most likely outcome of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): This mass will likely require excision
(B): This mass will decrease in size if the patient starts oral contraceptives
(C): This mass slightly increases this patient’s risk of breast cancer in the future
(D): This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time
(E): If this mass grows rapidly to greater than 5 cm, radiation and chemotherapy are indicated
",This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): This mass will most likely decrease in size or disappear over time.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a breast fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are the most common benign breast tumors in adolescent girls and young women. They typically present as a painless, mobile, and well-circumscribed mass. The tenderness reported by the patient preceding her menses is likely due to hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.

Fibroadenomas are hormone-sensitive tumors, and they may increase in size and become more tender during the menstrual cycle. However, they often decrease in size or even disappear over time, especially after menopause. Therefore, the most likely outcome for this patient's condition is that the mass will decrease in size or disappear on its own.

Excision is not typically necessary for fibroadenomas unless they are large, rapidly growing, causing significant discomfort, or there is concern for malignancy. In this case, the mass is only 3 cm and the patient is asymptomatic, so excision is not indicated.

Starting oral contraceptives (choice B) is not necessary for the management of fibroadenomas. While hormonal changes can affect the size and tenderness of the mass, the natural course of fibroadenomas is to decrease in size or disappear over time without any specific treatment.

Although the patient has a family history of breast cancer, the presence of a fibroadenoma does not significantly increase her risk of developing breast cancer in the future (choice C). Fibroadenomas are benign tumors and do not progress to malignancy.

Lastly, radiation and chemotherapy (choice E) are not indicated for fibroadenomas. These treatment modalities are reserved for malignant breast tumors, not benign fibroadenomas.",
"A 22-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a headache. She has had episodic headaches like this in the past and states that her headache today is severe, worse when laying down, and not responding to ibuprofen. She also reports a transient episode of vision loss and current blurry vision. She states she has a ringing in her ears as well. The patient has a past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 149/92 mmHg, pulse is 83/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is not remarkable and an initial head CT is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management for the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): 100% oxygen
(B): Ibuprofen
(C): Lumbar puncture
(D): MRI
(E): Tissue plasminogen activator
",Lumbar puncture,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Lumbar puncture.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of severe headache, worse when laying down, not responding to ibuprofen, transient episode of vision loss, and current blurry vision, along with her past medical history of headaches, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and constipation, the most likely diagnosis is increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or intracranial hypertension.

The patient's physical exam is not remarkable, and the initial head CT is within normal limits. However, a normal head CT does not rule out increased ICP, as it may not be sensitive enough to detect subtle changes. Therefore, the next best step in management for the most likely diagnosis is a lumbar puncture.

A lumbar puncture can help measure the opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and evaluate for any abnormalities, such as elevated CSF pressure or presence of red blood cells, which may indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage. It can also help rule out other causes of headache, such as meningitis or encephalitis.

Options (A) 100% oxygen, (B) Ibuprofen, (D) MRI, and (E) Tissue plasminogen activator are not appropriate next steps in management for the most likely diagnosis of increased ICP or intracranial hypertension. Oxygen therapy is not indicated in this case. Ibuprofen has already been tried and is not effective. An MRI may be considered later if the lumbar puncture is inconclusive or if there are specific indications for imaging. Tissue plasminogen activator is used for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and is not indicated in this case.",
"A 28-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of amenorrhea. Her last period occurred 4 months ago but she has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative. She first started having periods at age 13 and her periods have been unremarkable up until they stopped 4 months ago. Her past medical history is significant for radius and ulnar forearm fractures that she sustained in a car crash 3 months ago. She didn't see the car coming and has had increasing difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision. She also notes having recurrent headaches 5 months ago. Otherwise she has been healthy with no previous pregnancies. Physical exam reveals galactorrhea and temporal field visual defects. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's amenorrhea?
Options:
(A): Excessive production of androgens
(B): Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release
(C): Intrauterine scar tissue accumulation
(D): Nondisjunction of chromosomes
(E): Nutritional imbalance
",Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone release.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most likely mechanism responsible for her amenorrhea is inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. The patient has not had sex in the last year and home pregnancy tests have come back negative, ruling out pregnancy as the cause of her amenorrhea. Additionally, her past medical history of forearm fractures and symptoms of difficulty noticing objects in her peripheral vision and recurrent headaches suggest a pituitary tumor, which can cause inhibition of GnRH release. The presence of galactorrhea further supports this diagnosis, as hyperprolactinemia (excessive production of prolactin) is often associated with pituitary tumors. Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for this patient's amenorrhea is inhibition of GnRH release, which can be caused by a pituitary tumor.",
"A 57-year-old homeless man is brought to the emergency department because of several episodes of hematemesis in the past 24 hours. His vital signs include a temperature of 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse of 95/min, and blood pressure of 85/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, he appears confused and unable to give a complete history. He is noted to have jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness consistent with the presence of ascites. Liver function tests are as follows:
Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)  97 U/L
Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 40 U/L
Serum albumin 2.5 g/dL
Total bilirubin 3 mg/dL
Prothrombin time 20 seconds
Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's illness?
Options:
(A): Metabolic disorder
(B): Autoimmune liver disease
(C): Substance abuse
(D): Obesity
(E):  Hepatic venous outflow obstruction
",Substance abuse,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Substance abuse.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history of hematemesis, jaundice, palpable firm liver, mild splenomegaly, and shifting dullness consistent with ascites, along with the laboratory findings of elevated AST, normal ALT, low serum albumin, and elevated total bilirubin, the most likely cause of this patient's illness is substance abuse.

Substance abuse, particularly alcohol abuse, is a common cause of liver disease. The elevated AST and normal ALT suggest hepatocellular injury, which is commonly seen in alcohol-related liver disease. The low serum albumin is consistent with impaired liver synthetic function. The elevated total bilirubin may be due to impaired bilirubin metabolism by the damaged liver.

The patient's confusion and inability to give a complete history may be due to hepatic encephalopathy, which can occur in advanced liver disease. The presence of ascites suggests portal hypertension, which can also be seen in liver disease.

Metabolic disorders, autoimmune liver disease, obesity, and hepatic venous outflow obstruction are less likely causes in this patient based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings.",
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department for a cough and fatigue. The patient was brought in from a nursing home with documentation stating that he has seemed confused for the past day according to the staff. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes and hypertension. He is currently taking insulin, metformin, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 107/58 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam reveals crackles on pulmonary exam and S4 on cardiac auscultation. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Azithromycin and admission to the medical floor
(B): Azithromycin and discharge
(C): Azithromycin, moxifloxacin, and admission to the intensive care unit
(D): Ceftriaxone, azithromycin, and admission to the intensive care unit
(E): Moxifloxacin and admission to the medical floor
",Moxifloxacin and admission to the medical floor,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Moxifloxacin and admission to the medical floor.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical exam findings, he likely has a respiratory infection, which is supported by the presence of crackles on pulmonary exam. The patient's symptoms of cough, fatigue, and confusion, along with his vital signs (elevated temperature, tachycardia, and hypotension), suggest a systemic infection. The crackles on pulmonary exam indicate possible pneumonia.

Given the patient's history of diabetes and hypertension, as well as his age and the fact that he resides in a nursing home, he is at higher risk for developing severe infections. Therefore, admission to the medical floor is warranted for close monitoring and management.

Moxifloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers both typical and atypical pathogens commonly associated with pneumonia. It is an appropriate choice for empiric treatment in this patient. Azithromycin, another antibiotic option, is also effective against atypical pathogens and could be considered as an alternative. However, moxifloxacin has a broader spectrum of coverage and is therefore the preferred choice in this case.

Admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's vital signs, although abnormal, do not indicate severe illness requiring ICU-level care. Additionally, the patient's oxygen saturation is normal on room air, suggesting that he does not require immediate respiratory support.

Ceftriaxone, another antibiotic option, is commonly used for community-acquired pneumonia. However, given the patient's presentation and the fact that moxifloxacin covers both typical and atypical pathogens, moxifloxacin is the preferred choice in this case.

Therefore, the next best step in management is to initiate treatment with moxifloxacin and admit the patient to the medical floor for further evaluation and monitoring.",
"A 72-year-old man in a nursing home was brought to the emergency department with right hand and leg weakness for 1 hour. There has been a gradual increase in the degree of weakness. The patient is disoriented. The medical history includes ischemic heart disease diagnosed 2 months ago, and long histories of diabetes and hypertension (30 and 25 years, respectively). On examination, the reflexes are hypertonic and the Babinski reflex is positive. The CT scan is shown. What is the most likely pathologic change?
Options:
(A): Gangrenous necrosis
(B): Liquefactive necrosis
(C): Caseous necrosis
(D): Fibrinoid necrosis
(E): Coagulative necrosis
",Liquefactive necrosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Liquefactive necrosis.

Explanation:
Liquefactive necrosis is characterized by the dissolution of dead cells, resulting in the formation of a liquid-filled cavity. This type of necrosis is commonly seen in the brain, as seen in the CT scan provided. 

In this case, the patient's symptoms of right hand and leg weakness, along with disorientation, suggest a neurological issue. The hypertonic reflexes and positive Babinski reflex further support this. Liquefactive necrosis is often seen in the brain due to ischemic injury, which can occur in conditions such as ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and hypertension, all of which the patient has a history of. 

Gangrenous necrosis is characterized by tissue death due to ischemia, typically seen in extremities such as the limbs. This is not the most likely pathologic change in this case, as the symptoms and CT scan findings do not suggest gangrene.

Caseous necrosis is characterized by a cheesy, granular appearance and is commonly seen in tuberculosis infections. This is not the most likely pathologic change in this case, as the symptoms and CT scan findings do not suggest tuberculosis.

Fibrinoid necrosis is characterized by the deposition of fibrin and immune complexes in the walls of blood vessels, often seen in conditions such as vasculitis. This is not the most likely pathologic change in this case, as the symptoms and CT scan findings do not suggest vasculitis.

Coagulative necrosis is characterized by the preservation of tissue architecture, but with loss of cellular detail. This is commonly seen in ischemic injury, such as in myocardial infarction. However, the symptoms and CT scan findings in this case are more consistent with liquefactive necrosis.",
"An 11-year-old boy was brought in by his mother with red tender bumps on his legs. The patient’s mother says that his symptoms started 3 days ago with a low-grade fever, malaise, and joint pain. He began to improve over the next 2 days, but this morning, when he woke up, she noticed multiple painful red bumps on his shins. Past medical history is significant for a recent severe sore throat and fever 1 week ago which resolved without treatment. The vital signs include: temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F), blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, pulse 85/min, and respiratory rate 15/min. Physical examination reveals multiple, firm and tender erythematous nodules with indistinct borders, averaging 4 cm in diameter. Lesions are localized to the anterior surface of the lower legs. No evidence of drainage, bleeding, abscess formation or ulceration. Which of the following is the next best diagnostic step in this patient?
Options:
(A): Throat culture
(B): Chest radiograph
(C): p-ANCA serology
(D): Bone marrow biopsy
(E): Colonoscopy
",Throat culture,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Throat culture.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is erythema nodosum (EN). EN is a type of panniculitis characterized by tender erythematous nodules on the extensor surfaces of the lower legs. It is often associated with an underlying systemic condition, such as an infection or inflammatory disease.

In this case, the patient's recent severe sore throat and fever 1 week ago, which resolved without treatment, is suggestive of a preceding streptococcal infection. Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis is a common cause of EN in children. Therefore, the next best diagnostic step in this patient would be a throat culture to confirm the presence of GAS.

Throat culture is a simple and non-invasive test that involves swabbing the back of the throat to collect a sample of bacteria. The sample is then cultured in a laboratory to identify the presence of GAS. A positive throat culture would confirm the diagnosis of a preceding streptococcal infection, supporting the diagnosis of EN.

Chest radiograph (B) is not indicated in this patient as there are no respiratory symptoms or findings on physical examination to suggest a pulmonary condition.

p-ANCA serology (C) is not indicated in this patient as there are no clinical features to suggest an autoimmune vasculitis, which is associated with p-ANCA positivity.

Bone marrow biopsy (D) is not indicated in this patient as there are no clinical features to suggest a hematologic disorder or malignancy.

Colonoscopy (E) is not indicated in this patient as there are no gastrointestinal symptoms or findings on physical examination to suggest an underlying inflammatory bowel disease.",
"Two hours after admission to the hospital for rupture of membranes, a 35-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 40 weeks’ gestation is evaluated for the sudden onset of chills, dyspnea, confusion, and hypotension. The patient successfully underwent combined spinal-epidural anesthesia 1 hour ago. Her pregnancy was uncomplicated with the exception of a positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci 3 weeks ago, for which she received one dose of intravenous penicillin. Her temperature is 37.6°C (99.8°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 30/min, and blood pressure is 70/30 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 82%. Physical examination shows labored breathing and thready pulses. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. The abdomen is nontender. Speculum examination shows pooling of bright red blood in the cervical canal. Laboratory studies show a hemoglobin concentration of 7.6 mg/dL and an undetectable fibrinogen concentration. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s current condition?
Options:
(A): Apical ballooning of the left ventricle
(B): Allergic reaction to anesthetic agent
(C): Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins
(D): Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space
(E): Systemic bacterial infection
",Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Amniotic fluid entering the endocervical veins.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), which occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation. AFE is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of pregnancy. It most commonly occurs during labor, delivery, or immediately postpartum. The classic triad of symptoms includes sudden dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. Other common findings include hypoxemia, coagulopathy, and cardiovascular collapse. The pathophysiology of AFE is not completely understood, but it is thought to involve an immune response to fetal antigens in the amniotic fluid, leading to a systemic inflammatory reaction. This can cause widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The presence of bright red blood in the cervical canal on speculum examination is consistent with vaginal bleeding, which can occur in AFE due to DIC-induced consumptive coagulopathy. The laboratory findings of low hemoglobin and undetectable fibrinogen further support the diagnosis of DIC. The patient's history of rupture of membranes and recent positive vaginal swab for group B streptococci suggests that she may have had an ascending infection, which could have contributed to the development of AFE. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with the other options. Apical ballooning of the left ventricle (Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) typically presents with chest pain and ECG changes, but not with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. An allergic reaction to the anesthetic agent would typically present with rash, urticaria, or bronchospasm, but not with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. Anesthetic agent entering the subarachnoid space would not cause the systemic symptoms seen in this patient. Systemic bacterial infection would typically present with fever, but not with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status. Premature separation of the placenta from the uterus (placental abruption) would typically present with abdominal pain and uterine tenderness, but not with dyspnea, hypotension, and altered mental status.",
"A 54-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue. He reports that he recently went on a vacation to South America with his family but just wanted to stay in his hotel all day due to fatigue. His past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He takes lovastatin and lisinopril. He drinks socially and has a 20 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. On exam, the patient is appropriately interactive and in no acute distress. Mild splenomegaly is noted. Laboratory analysis reveals the following:

Hemoglobin: 11.0 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 3,800/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 140,000/mm^3

A bone marrow aspiration is ordered but after multiple attempts, they are unable to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample. A peripheral blood smear would likely reveal cells that stain with which of the following stains?
Options:
(A): Prussian Blue
(B): Ziehl-Neelsen
(C): Periodic acid-Schiff
(D): Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase
(E): Giemsa
",Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with fatigue, mild splenomegaly, and laboratory findings consistent with pancytopenia (low hemoglobin, hematocrit, leukocyte count, and platelet count). These findings, along with the inability to obtain an adequate bone marrow sample, suggest a possible diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia (HCL).

HCL is a rare type of chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the presence of abnormal B lymphocytes with hair-like projections on peripheral blood smear. These cells stain positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), which is a characteristic feature of HCL. Therefore, a peripheral blood smear in this patient would likely reveal cells that stain with TRAP.

Prussian Blue stain is used to detect iron in tissues and is not specific for HCL. Ziehl-Neelsen stain is used to detect acid-fast bacilli in tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections, which is not relevant in this case. Periodic acid-Schiff stain is used to detect glycogen and is not specific for HCL. Giemsa stain is commonly used in hematological examinations, but it is not specific for HCL.",
"While on a teaching sabbatical in Uruguay, a pathologist examined the excised liver of an 18-year-old otherwise healthy female who passed away due to massive hepatic necrosis 5 days after she underwent general anesthesia to repair a fractured femur. Which of the following is a general anesthetic most likely responsible for her death?
Options:
(A): Bupivacaine
(B): Lidocaine
(C): Midazolam
(D): Halothane
(E): Desflurane
",Halothane,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Halothane.

Explanation:
Halothane is the general anesthetic most likely responsible for the patient's death. Halothane has been associated with the greatest risk of hepatotoxicity, including acute, severe hepatitis, known as ""halothane hepatitis."" It produces a greater reduction in cardiac output and hepatic oxygen supply compared to other volatile anesthetics. The degree of hepatic metabolism of anesthetic agents correlates with the likelihood of a toxic reaction, and halothane has been associated with the highest risk of hepatotoxicity among the haloalkanes used in practice. It is important to note that halothane is no longer used in the United States. The other options (A) Bupivacaine, (B) Lidocaine, (C) Midazolam, and (E) Desflurane are not associated with hepatotoxicity and are not likely to be responsible for the patient's death.",
"A 45-year-old woman with hypothyroidism comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. Laboratory studies show decreased serum hemoglobin levels and increased serum gastrin levels. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy shows inflammation of the gastric body and fundus. A photomicrograph of a biopsy specimen taken from the gastric antrum is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Mucosal cell hyperplasia
(B): Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia
(C): Parietal cell destruction
(D): Chief cell destruction
(E): I cell destruction
",Parietal cell destruction,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Parietal cell destruction.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, lethargy, and epigastric pain after eating, along with physical examination findings of pale conjunctivae, suggest iron deficiency anemia. This is supported by the laboratory studies showing decreased serum hemoglobin levels. Increased serum gastrin levels indicate hypergastrinemia, which can be seen in conditions associated with decreased gastric acid secretion. The photomicrograph of the biopsy specimen showing inflammation of the gastric body and fundus further supports the diagnosis of autoimmune gastritis.

Autoimmune gastritis is characterized by the destruction of parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. Parietal cells are responsible for producing gastric acid and intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12. Destruction of parietal cells leads to decreased gastric acid secretion and subsequent malabsorption of vitamin B12, resulting in iron deficiency anemia.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is parietal cell destruction.",
"A 72-year-old anthropologist with long-standing hypertension visits your office for a routine exam. You notice an abnormality on his laboratory results caused by his regimen of captopril and triamterene. What abnormality did you most likely find?
Options:
(A): Hypercalcemia
(B): Hyperkalemia
(C): Hypernatremia
(D): Thrombocytopenia
(E): Anemia
",Hyperkalemia,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Hyperkalemia.

Explanation:
Hyperkalemia refers to an elevated level of potassium in the blood. Captopril and triamterene are both medications commonly used to treat hypertension. Captopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, while triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic. 

ACE inhibitors like captopril can cause an increase in potassium levels by inhibiting the production of aldosterone, a hormone that helps regulate potassium levels. This can lead to decreased excretion of potassium by the kidneys and subsequent hyperkalemia.

Triamterene, on the other hand, directly inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and reduces the excretion of potassium in the urine. This can also contribute to an increase in potassium levels and the development of hyperkalemia.

Therefore, in this case, the most likely abnormality found on the laboratory results would be hyperkalemia due to the patient's regimen of captopril and triamterene.",
"A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, and irritability for the past week. She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide. She used to drink over a pint of vodka daily but quit 2 months ago. She is oriented to place and person. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Reversal of TIPS
(B): Paracentesis
(C): Administer IV ceftriaxone
(D): Administer lactulose
(E): Administer vitamin B1
",Administer lactulose,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Administer lactulose.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with hepatic encephalopathy, which is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs in patients with liver dysfunction. The symptoms of confusion, fatigue, irritability, insomnia, and daytime sleepiness, along with the physical findings of asterixis (flapping tremor) and abnormal number connection test, are all indicative of hepatic encephalopathy.

The most appropriate next step in management is to administer lactulose. Lactulose is a nonabsorbable disaccharide that works by decreasing the production and absorption of ammonia in the gut. It is the mainstay of treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. Lactulose acidifies the colonic contents, which converts ammonia (NH3) to ammonium (NH4+), trapping it in the colon and preventing its absorption into the bloodstream. This reduces the ammonia levels in the blood and improves the symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy.

Reversal of TIPS (A) is not indicated in this patient as TIPS placement is not the cause of her hepatic encephalopathy. TIPS is a procedure used to treat complications of portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding or refractory ascites.

Paracentesis (B) is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Paracentesis is indicated in patients with tense ascites or suspected spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, but it does not address the underlying cause of hepatic encephalopathy.

Administering IV ceftriaxone (C) is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. IV ceftriaxone is used to treat bacterial infections and is not indicated for hepatic encephalopathy.

Administering vitamin B1 (E) is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is used to treat Wernicke encephalopathy, which is a different condition characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and altered mental status. While thiamine deficiency can contribute to hepatic encephalopathy in alcoholics, it is not the first-line treatment for hepatic encephalopathy.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with hepatic encephalopathy is to administer lactulose.",
"A 50-year-old woman is brought to the office by her daughter with a chief complaint of finger pain in her left hand. She is slightly confused and can’t remember when the pain started. Her daughter states that the pain has been present for approximately one month. She expresses concern that her mother has been progressively more confused during the past week. She reports that her mother also has had worsening nausea for several months. The patient’s vital signs are heart rate 92/min, respiratory rate 13/min, temperature 37.1°C (98.8°F), and blood pressure 120/86 mm Hg. Upon physical examination, the patient reports pain when the fingers of the left hand are palpated, and small palpable tumors are visible on the fingers. An X-ray image of the left-hand shows thin bones with brown tumors and osteolysis of the distal phalanges. What is the most likely cause for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Hyperparathyroidism
(B): Hypocalcemia
(C): Osteosarcoma
(D): Multiple myeloma
(E): Osteoporosis
",Hyperparathyroidism,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Hyperparathyroidism.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is characterized by excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from the parathyroid glands, leading to hypercalcemia. The most common cause of hyperparathyroidism is a benign adenoma of the parathyroid gland. 

The patient's symptoms of finger pain, confusion, and nausea are all consistent with hypercalcemia, which can occur in hyperparathyroidism. The small palpable tumors on the fingers, along with the X-ray findings of thin bones with brown tumors and osteolysis of the distal phalanges, are classic findings of hyperparathyroidism.

Hypocalcemia (B) is the opposite of hypercalcemia and is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Osteosarcoma (C) and multiple myeloma (D) are both types of bone cancer and would not typically present with the specific findings seen in this patient. Osteoporosis (E) is a condition characterized by decreased bone density, but it would not cause the specific findings seen in this patient.",
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, and easy bruising. Five months ago, she was treated for an episode of thrombophlebitis. Physical examination shows multiple bruises on her limbs. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 900,000/mm3 and elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid. Treatment with a medication is begun that is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease?
Options:
(A): Inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation
(B): Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin
(C): Substitution of cofactors for DNA synthesis
(D): Inhibition of stem cell differentiation
(E): Restoration of the body's iron stores
",Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with symptoms of lightheadedness, intermittent headaches, easy bruising, and laboratory findings of elevated platelet count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and uric acid. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera, a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

The treatment for polycythemia vera involves reducing the number of red blood cells and platelets in order to prevent complications such as thrombosis. One of the medications used in the treatment of polycythemia vera is hydroxyurea, which is also used in the treatment of sickle cell disease.

Hydroxyurea works by increasing the production of fetal hemoglobin, which is a type of hemoglobin that is normally present in newborns but is replaced by adult hemoglobin shortly after birth. Fetal hemoglobin has a higher affinity for oxygen and can prevent the sickling of red blood cells in sickle cell disease. By increasing the levels of fetal hemoglobin, hydroxyurea can improve the symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for the beneficial effect of this drug in sickle cell disease is an increase in circulating fetal hemoglobin.",
"Candida is injected into the skin of a 38-year-old female patient. Forty-eight hours later, there is a 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site. What type of hypersensitivity reaction has occurred and what cell type plays a role?
Options:
(A): Type I hypersensitivty; eosinophils
(B): Type IV hypersensitivity; mast cells
(C): Type III hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells
(D): Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells
(E): Type I hypersensitivity; macrophages
",Type IV hypersensitivity,Incorrect, CD4+ T cells,"The correct choice is (D): Type IV hypersensitivity; CD4+ T cells.

Explanation:
Type IV hypersensitivity reactions, also known as delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), are cell-mediated immune responses that occur 48-72 hours after exposure to an antigen. In this case, the injection of Candida into the skin of the patient has triggered a type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

CD4+ T cells play a crucial role in type IV hypersensitivity reactions. These T cells become sensitized to the antigen and upon re-exposure, they release cytokines that activate other immune cells, such as macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils, and natural killer cells. These effector cells contribute to the inflammatory response and tissue damage seen in type IV hypersensitivity reactions.

In the given scenario, the 14 mm raised, slightly hardened area at the injection site is indicative of a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, which is characteristic of type IV hypersensitivity."
"On routine screening, a 62-year-old man is found to have positive fecal occult blood tests. He is asymptomatic, but his father died of large intestinal cancer. Abdominal and rectal exams are normal. A colonoscopy subsequently reveals a polyp in the descending colon but no other abnormalities. Excisional biopsy of the polyp shows 75% tubular architecture. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Inflammatory polyp
(B): Adenomatous polyp
(C): Hamartomatous polyp
(D): Colorectal cancer
(E): Hemorrhoids
",Adenomatous polyp,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Adenomatous polyp.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a positive fecal occult blood test, which indicates the presence of blood in the stool. This finding, along with the family history of large intestinal cancer, raises suspicion for colorectal pathology. The colonoscopy reveals a polyp in the descending colon, which is a common location for adenomatous polyps.

Adenomatous polyps are the most common type of polyps found in the colon and are considered precursors to colorectal cancer. The histological examination of the excisional biopsy showing 75% tubular architecture further supports the diagnosis of an adenomatous polyp. Tubular adenomas are the most common subtype of adenomatous polyps and are characterized by the presence of tubular structures.

Inflammatory polyps are typically associated with inflammatory bowel disease and are not commonly found in asymptomatic individuals. Hamartomatous polyps, such as juvenile polyps or Peutz-Jeghers polyps, are usually seen in younger patients and are not typically associated with positive fecal occult blood tests. Colorectal cancer would be a concern in this patient given the positive fecal occult blood test and family history, but the presence of a single polyp without other abnormalities makes adenomatous polyp a more likely diagnosis. Hemorrhoids are a common cause of rectal bleeding, but they would not explain the positive fecal occult blood test or the presence of a polyp.",
"A 20-year-old male college student presents to the emergency room at 4 AM in the morning with complaints of abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for the past 2 hours. He was studying for his exams last night when he became hungry and ate some food from the afternoon after heating it for a while. He says that his symptoms began an hour after he ate the food. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 106/min, and blood pressure is 90/78 mm Hg. A physical examination is within normal limits except for signs of dehydration. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Cryptosporidiosis
(B): C. difficile colitis
(C): Bacillus cereus infection
(D): Norovirus infection
(E): Rotavirus infection
",Bacillus cereus infection,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Bacillus cereus infection.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with the timing of the symptoms starting one hour after eating food that was reheated, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillus cereus infection.

Bacillus cereus is a type of bacteria commonly found in soil and contaminated food. It produces toxins that can cause food poisoning when ingested. The symptoms typically occur within 1-6 hours after consuming contaminated food and include abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The patient's symptoms starting one hour after eating the reheated food align with the typical timeline for Bacillus cereus infection. Additionally, the presence of signs of dehydration on physical examination suggests that the patient is experiencing significant fluid loss due to the vomiting and diarrhea.

Cryptosporidiosis is caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium and typically presents with watery diarrhea. It is less likely in this case as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a bacterial infection.

C. difficile colitis is caused by the bacteria Clostridium difficile and typically presents with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. However, the timing of symptoms and the patient's history of eating reheated food make Bacillus cereus infection a more likely diagnosis.

Norovirus infection and rotavirus infection are both viral infections that can cause gastroenteritis. However, the timing of symptoms and the patient's history of eating reheated food make Bacillus cereus infection a more likely diagnosis.",
"A 79-year-old woman presents to her physician complaining of a persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea after contracting a cold in the past month. She describes herself as being “generally healthy” before the cold started. Medical history includes hypertension and hyperlipidemia. The patient takes hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and atorvastatin. Her parents are both deceased. She does not smoke and only drinks alcohol occasionally. During a review of symptoms, she described a month-long trip to St. Louis, Missouri, to visit family. At the physician’s office, her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 82/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. A focused chest exam reveals mild crepitus on the right side. A chest X-ray shows a cavitary lesion in the right lung which is confirmed on chest computed tomography (CT). A lung biopsy is performed to rule out cancer and reveals necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Coccidioidomycosis
(B): Blastomycosis
(C): Sporotrichosis
(D): Histoplasmosis
(E): Onychomycosis
",Histoplasmosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Histoplasmosis.

Explanation:
The patient's history of travel to St. Louis, Missouri, is important because histoplasmosis is endemic to this region. Histoplasmosis is caused by the fungus Histoplasma capsulatum, which is found in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Inhalation of the fungal spores can lead to infection. The patient's symptoms of persistent non-productive cough and dyspnea, along with the presence of a cavitary lesion in the lung on imaging, are consistent with pulmonary histoplasmosis. The lung biopsy findings of necrotic granulomatous inflammation with oval yeast in macrophages further support the diagnosis of histoplasmosis. Coccidioidomycosis (choice A) is caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis and is endemic to the southwestern United States, not St. Louis, Missouri. Blastomycosis (choice B) is caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis and is also not endemic to St. Louis, Missouri. Sporotrichosis (choice C) is caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii and typically presents as a localized cutaneous infection following traumatic inoculation. Onychomycosis (choice E) is a fungal infection of the nails and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.",
"A 14-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not yet had her period. She is at the 10th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. Examination shows a broad chest with widely spaced nipples, a low posterior hairline, forearms angled 20° away from the body when fully extended, and shortened fourth metacarpals bilaterally. Sexual development is Tanner stage 1. Which of the following statements about this patient's fertility is most accurate?
Options:
(A): Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure
(B): Administration of gonadotropins will increase the chances of conceiving
(C): Impaired tubal ciliary function will prevent natural fertilization
(D): The majority of patients become pregnant without medical assistance
(E): Functional gametes and the absence of a uterus make surrogacy necessary
",Pregnancy success rate with donor oocytes is similar to patients with primary ovarian failure,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (E): Functional gametes and the absence of a uterus make surrogacy necessary.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the patient has a number of physical findings that are consistent with Turner syndrome, including short stature, broad chest with widely spaced nipples, low posterior hairline, and shortened fourth metacarpals. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the ovaries, resulting in infertility.

In Turner syndrome, the ovaries are usually nonfunctional or absent, leading to a lack of functional gametes (eggs). Without functional eggs, natural fertilization is not possible, making it difficult for the patient to conceive without medical assistance.

Additionally, the absence of a uterus (as mentioned in the context information) further contributes to the patient's infertility. The uterus is necessary for the implantation and development of a fertilized egg. In the absence of a uterus, the patient would require surrogacy in order to have a successful pregnancy.

Therefore, the most accurate statement about this patient's fertility is that functional gametes and the absence of a uterus make surrogacy necessary (option E).",
"An investigator is studying traumatic knee joint injuries in college athletes. Images and tissue samples are collected from 4 athletes with cartilaginous injury and 4 athletes with bone fractures. After 8 weeks, the athletes with bone fractures show almost complete resolution, while the athletes with cartilaginous injuries show only minimal signs of healing. The investigator hypothesizes that this is due to the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration. Transplant of which of the following tissues would most likely promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury?
Options:
(A): Perichondrium
(B): Proteoglycans
(C): Chondronectin
(D): Osteoblasts
(E): Mature chondrocytes
",Perichondrium,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Perichondrium.

Explanation:
The perichondrium is a connective tissue layer that surrounds cartilage. It contains progenitor cells called chondroprogenitor cells, which have the ability to differentiate into chondrocytes, the cells responsible for producing cartilage matrix. These chondroprogenitor cells can contribute to the repair and regeneration of cartilage. 

In the case of cartilaginous injuries, the absence of progenitor cells for matrix regeneration may be a limiting factor in the healing process. Transplanting perichondrium, which contains chondroprogenitor cells, would provide a source of these cells and promote healing in the group with cartilaginous injury. 

Proteoglycans (B) are components of the extracellular matrix of cartilage and play a role in maintaining its structure and function. However, they do not have the ability to differentiate into chondrocytes and therefore would not directly contribute to matrix regeneration.

Chondronectin (C) is a protein found in the extracellular matrix of cartilage. It helps to anchor chondrocytes to the matrix. While it is important for cartilage function, it does not have the ability to differentiate into chondrocytes and would not promote matrix regeneration.

Osteoblasts (D) are cells responsible for bone formation. They do not have the ability to differentiate into chondrocytes and would not be suitable for promoting healing in cartilaginous injuries.

Mature chondrocytes (E) are the cells responsible for producing and maintaining cartilage matrix. While they can contribute to matrix regeneration, they are already present in the injured tissue and may not be sufficient for promoting healing. Transplanting perichondrium, which contains chondroprogenitor cells, would provide a source of cells that can differentiate into chondrocytes and promote matrix regeneration.",
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of increasing weakness and numbness of the upper extremities for 5 days. During the past 2 days, she has had urinary incontinence not related to sneezing or laughing. Last summer, she had weakness and numbness of her right lower extremity that was worse when she was outside; she regained her strength 3 weeks later. She has no history of serious illness. She has had 10 male sexual partners in her lifetime and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows an impaired tandem gait. There is mild spasticity and muscle strength is decreased in both upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 4+ bilaterally. The abdominal reflex is absent. Muscle strength in the right lower extremity is mildly decreased. Sensation to vibration and fine touch is decreased over the upper extremities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Antinuclear antibody testing
(B): Muscle biopsy
(C): Rapid plasma reagin test
(D): MRI of the brain and spine
(E): Lumbar puncture
",MRI of the brain and spine,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) MRI of the brain and spine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that commonly presents with a relapsing-remitting course. The patient's history of weakness and numbness in the right lower extremity that resolved after 3 weeks is consistent with a previous MS relapse. The current symptoms of weakness and numbness in the upper extremities, along with urinary incontinence, suggest a new relapse involving the spinal cord.

MRI of the brain and spine is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis because it can help confirm the presence of demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system, which is characteristic of MS. The MRI findings typically show multiple hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images, often in a periventricular or juxtacortical distribution. The presence of lesions in both the brain and spine can help differentiate MS from other conditions that may present with similar symptoms.

Antinuclear antibody testing (A) is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not suggestive of an autoimmune connective tissue disorder.

Muscle biopsy (B) is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not suggestive of a primary muscle disorder.

Rapid plasma reagin test (C) is not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not suggestive of syphilis, which is the condition that the test is used to diagnose.

Lumbar puncture (E) may be considered in the evaluation of MS to assess for the presence of oligoclonal bands and an elevated IgG index in the cerebrospinal fluid. However, MRI is the initial imaging modality of choice to evaluate for demyelinating lesions in the central nervous system.",
"A 37-year-old woman presents to your office with heartburn. Following an extensive workup, you diagnose her with a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection. You prescribe triple therapy of omeprazole, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of omeprazole?
Options:
(A): SST2 receptor agonist
(B): Parasympathetic inhibition
(C): Reversible block of H2 receptors
(D): Inhibition of primary active transport
(E): Inhibition of 50S ribosomal subunit
",Inhibition of primary active transport,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Inhibition of primary active transport.

Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) that suppresses gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the parietal cell H+/K+ ATP pump. It concentrates in the acid conditions of the parietal cell secretory canaliculi and forms an active sulfenamide metabolite that irreversibly binds to and inactivates the hydrogen-potassium ATPase (proton pump), which is the final step in the secretion of hydrochloric acid. This inhibition of the primary active transport of hydrogen ions blocks the production of gastric acid, leading to a decrease in acid secretion. The effect of omeprazole lasts until additional hydrogen-potassium ATPase is synthesized, resulting in a prolonged duration of action.

In the context of treating a duodenal ulcer secondary to H. pylori infection, omeprazole is used as part of triple therapy, along with clarithromycin and amoxicillin, to effectively eradicate the H. pylori gastric infection.",
"A 47-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling of her right hand. Two days ago, she was camping outdoors in Texas with her two young children. She was awoken in the middle of the night by “something crawling on my hand.” The following morning, she saw a wound on her hand that was initially painless, but over the next several hours she noticed reddening and blistering. Yesterday, the lesion turned blue with a blackish discoloration at the center. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 83/min, and blood pressure is 128/84 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of erythema at the dorsum of the right hand. Which of the following animals is most likely responsible for the patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Bald-faced hornet
(B): Diamondback rattlesnake
(C): Brown recluse spider
(D): Striped bark scorpion
(E): Deer tick
",Brown recluse spider,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Brown recluse spider.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with a bite from a brown recluse spider. Brown recluse spiders are found in the southern and central United States, including Texas. They are known for their venomous bite, which can cause local tissue necrosis. The initial painless wound followed by worsening pain, discoloration, and swelling, along with the development of a bluish plaque with a central area of necrosis surrounded by erythema, are characteristic of a brown recluse spider bite. The blackish discoloration at the center of the lesion is known as eschar formation, which is a hallmark of brown recluse spider bites. Systemic symptoms such as fever can also occur. It is important to seek medical attention for a suspected brown recluse spider bite, as treatment may include wound care, pain management, and, in severe cases, surgical intervention.",
"Two weeks after starting chemotherapy with etoposide, a 66-year-old man with small cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of persistent nausea and vomiting. His symptoms improve significantly after the administration of metoclopramide. This patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on which of the following structures?
Options:
(A): Vestibular nerve
(B): Intestinal smooth muscle
(C): Vagus nerve
(D): Cerebral cortex
(E): Area postrema
",Area postrema,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Area postrema.

Explanation:
Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can occur through a central and a peripheral pathway. The central pathway is predominantly mediated by Substance P and NK1 receptors and is located primarily in the brain. The peripheral pathway is predominantly mediated by 5-HT and 5-HT3 receptors in the intestinal tract.

In this case, the patient's symptoms improved significantly after the administration of metoclopramide, which is a dopamine receptor antagonist that acts on the central pathway. Metoclopramide blocks dopamine receptors in the area postrema, which is a structure in the brainstem that contains a high concentration of dopamine receptors and is involved in the emetic response.

Therefore, the patient's symptoms were most likely due to the effect of chemotherapy on the area postrema, and the administration of metoclopramide helped alleviate the symptoms by blocking dopamine receptors in this structure.",
"A 55-year-old construction worker is struck by a high-voltage power line while on duty. According to bystanders, the cable struck him on his right arm, after which the man slumped to the ground with his arms and legs shaking. In the emergency department, the man is alert but in severe pain localizing bilaterally in the flanks as well as in his right arm where contact with the power line occurred. A 6 cm burn is present on the right arm. His vitals are within normal limits except for mild tachypnea at 21/min. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be conducted first to evaluate this patient?
Options:
(A): FAST ultrasound assessment
(B): Urine dipstick
(C): Urinalysis
(D): X-ray of the arm and shoulder
(E): EEG
",Urinalysis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Urinalysis.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has been struck by a high-voltage power line, resulting in severe pain and a burn on his right arm. The presence of bilateral flank pain suggests the possibility of electrical injury-induced rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). Therefore, the first diagnostic test that should be conducted is a urinalysis.

Rhabdomyolysis is a condition characterized by the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading to the release of myoglobin into the bloodstream. Myoglobin can cause renal tubular injury, leading to AKI. The presence of myoglobin in the urine, known as myoglobinuria, is an important indicator of rhabdomyolysis.

A urinalysis can help identify the presence of myoglobin in the urine, as well as other markers of kidney injury such as proteinuria and hematuria. It can also provide information about the patient's hydration status and electrolyte levels, which are important considerations in managing rhabdomyolysis.

The other options are not the most appropriate initial diagnostic tests in this scenario:

(A) FAST ultrasound assessment is typically used to evaluate for intra-abdominal bleeding in trauma patients. While it may be useful in certain cases, it is not the most immediate concern in this patient.

(B) Urine dipstick is a quick screening test that can detect the presence of certain substances in the urine, such as blood, protein, and glucose. However, it may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of kidney function and injury markers, which is necessary in this case.

(D) X-ray of the arm and shoulder may be useful to assess for fractures or other injuries related to the electrical contact, but it does not address the potential systemic complications of rhabdomyolysis and AKI.

(E) EEG (electroencephalogram) is a test used to evaluate brain activity and is not indicated in this scenario, where the primary concern is the evaluation of potential kidney injury.",
"A 69-year-old male presents to the emergency department with shortness of breath. The patient has presented three times this past month with similar complaints. The patient sees no primary care physician and is currently not taking any medications. The patient states his shortness of breath started when he was walking from his car to a local restaurant. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 100/min, blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 96% on room air. On physical exam you note a fatigued appearing gentleman. Cardiovascular exam reveals an additional heart sound after S2. Pulmonary exam is notable for bilateral crackles. Abdominal exam reveals an obese abdomen without pain in any of the quadrants. Lower extremity pitting edema is noted bilaterally. Which of the following sets of lab values most likely corresponds to this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): High BNP, high ADH, high sodium, high potassium
(B): High BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, low potassium
(C): High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium
(D): Low BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium
(E): Low BNP, low ADH, normal sodium, normal potassium
","High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium",Correct,"The correct choice is (C): High BNP, high ADH, low sodium, low potassium.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). CHF is a condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. The symptoms of CHF include shortness of breath, fatigue, crackles on lung exam, and lower extremity edema, all of which are present in this patient.

BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) is a hormone released by the ventricles of the heart in response to increased pressure and volume. Elevated levels of BNP are seen in patients with CHF, making option (C) the correct choice.

ADH (antidiuretic hormone) is released by the pituitary gland in response to low blood volume or increased osmolality. In CHF, the heart's inability to pump effectively leads to decreased blood flow to the kidneys, which triggers the release of ADH. This results in increased water reabsorption by the kidneys, leading to fluid retention and exacerbating the symptoms of CHF. Therefore, option (C) is the correct choice.

In CHF, the kidneys are unable to excrete excess sodium, leading to sodium retention and dilutional hyponatremia. This is reflected in the lab values of low sodium, making option (C) the correct choice.

In CHF, the kidneys are also unable to excrete excess potassium, leading to hyperkalemia. However, the lab values in option (C) indicate low potassium, which is not consistent with CHF. Therefore, option (C) is the correct choice.

In summary, the lab values of high BNP, high ADH, low sodium, and low potassium are most likely to correspond to this patient's presentation of congestive heart failure.",
"A 48-year-old man presents to the clinic with nausea, vomiting, fever, and pain in the right upper quadrant of his abdomen for the past 18 hours. He mentions that he has been experiencing intermittent episodes of pain at the same location over the last 3 months and that these episodes usually occur after a heavy meal and subside within 1 or 2 hours. On physical examination, his temperature is 38.5°C (101.3°F), pulse is 130/min, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 130/84 mm Hg. On examination of the abdomen, tenderness is present over the right upper quadrant; palpation over the area produces an inspiratory pause. An urgent bedside ultrasonogram shows a dilated common bile duct stone, but no stone in the common bile duct or in the gallbladder. Laboratory results show the following:
Hemoglobin 15.4 g/dL (9.56 mmol/L)
Total leukocyte count 14,000/mm3 (17.4 x 10*9/L)
Segmented neutrophils 70%
Lymphocytes 25%
Monocytes 4%
Eosinophils 1%
Basophils 0%
Platelet count 32,0000/mm3 (320 x 10*9/L)
Serum bilirubin (total) 1.8 mg/dL (30.78 μmol/L)
Serum bilirubin (direct) 1.1 mg/dL (18.81 μmol/L)
Serum alanine aminotransferase 96 U/L
Serum aspartate aminotransferase 88 U/L
Serum alkaline phosphatase
350 U/L (5.83 μkat/L)
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy
(B): Medical management followed by elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy
(C): Medical management followed by elective open cholecystectomy
(D): Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP)
(E): Cholecystotomy
",Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP),Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ECRP).

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholangitis, which is characterized by fever, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and evidence of systemic inflammation. The presence of a dilated common bile duct stone on ultrasound suggests obstruction of the biliary tree, leading to cholangitis. The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis, with elevated liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) and alkaline phosphatase, as well as a mildly elevated total and direct bilirubin. The low platelet count may be due to sepsis or liver dysfunction.

Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the most appropriate next step in management. ERCP allows for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. It can confirm the presence of a common bile duct stone and provide immediate relief by removing the stone or placing a stent to bypass the obstruction. This procedure is preferred over surgical intervention (options A, B, and C) because it is less invasive and can be performed urgently. Cholecystotomy (option E) is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have evidence of acute cholecystitis.",
"A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by police after he was found undressing himself outside in 110°F weather. The patient refuses to answer any questions as he suspects that his care team is spying on him. The patient recently started college and has presented to the emergency department once before for polysubstance intoxication. The patient attempts to assault a nurse, is restrained, and given diphenhydramine and haloperidol. When the patient is able to be examined, he is somnolent and non-responsive. His temperature is 104°F (40°C), blood pressure is 147/98 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. He does not comply with any commands, and it is not possible to freely manipulate his extremities due to rigidity. His mucous membranes are dry. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Catatonic schizophrenia
(B): Heat stroke
(C): Malignant hyperthermia
(D): Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(E): Oversedation
",Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

Explanation:
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur as a result of treatment with antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol. It is characterized by a hyperthermic state, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and generalized muscle rigidity.

In this case, the patient's presentation is consistent with NMS. He has a high fever (104°F), altered mental status (somnolent and non-responsive), autonomic dysfunction (dry mucous membranes), and generalized muscle rigidity. These symptoms are all indicative of NMS.

The patient's refusal to answer questions and suspicion of being spied on may be related to his underlying psychiatric condition, but the acute onset of symptoms and the association with antipsychotic medication use suggest that NMS is the most likely diagnosis.

Catatonic schizophrenia is a subtype of schizophrenia characterized by motor abnormalities, such as immobility or excessive motor activity. While the patient's rigidity may be consistent with catatonia, the acute onset of symptoms and association with antipsychotic medication use make NMS a more likely diagnosis.

Heat stroke is a possibility given the high ambient temperature and the patient's behavior of undressing himself outside. However, the presence of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and muscle rigidity are not typical of heat stroke. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are more likely related to his medication use.

Malignant hyperthermia is a rare genetic disorder that can be triggered by certain medications, such as succinylcholine or volatile anesthetics. It is characterized by a hypermetabolic state, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. While the patient's symptoms may be consistent with hyperthermia, the acute onset of symptoms and the association with antipsychotic medication use make NMS a more likely diagnosis.

Oversedation is a possibility given the patient's somnolence and non-responsiveness. However, the presence of autonomic dysfunction, muscle rigidity, and the association with antipsychotic medication use make NMS a more likely diagnosis.",
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain and vaginal discharge. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy three days prior to presentation. Since then, she has been feeling sick, and she is concerned that she has been getting worse over time. On presentation, her temperature is 100.7°F (38.1°C), blood pressure is 115/78 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 14/min. Physical exam reveals abdominal discomfort with uterine tenderness, and laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count with many plasma cells. The most likely cause of this patient's disorder has which of the following characteristics?
Options:
(A): Alpha-hemolytic cocci in chains
(B): Beta-hemolytic cocci in chains
(C): Coagulase-negative cocci in clusters
(D): Coagulase-positive cocci in clusters
(E): Gamma-hemolytic cocci in chains
",Beta-hemolytic cocci in chains,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Beta-hemolytic cocci in chains.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, and feeling sick after giving birth are suggestive of an infection. The elevated white blood cell count and uterine tenderness on physical exam further support this. The most likely cause of this infection is Group B Streptococcus (GBS), which is a beta-hemolytic cocci in chains. GBS is a common cause of postpartum infections, including endometritis (infection of the uterine lining) and sepsis. It is important to identify and treat GBS infections promptly to prevent complications.",
"An 18-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician because his mother is concerned about his walking. The boy was born at 37 weeks’ gestation and spent 1 night in the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress. He otherwise has been healthy and started walking independently at 12 months. However, his mother reports that he has stopped walking and appears weaker than he was a few months ago. He also has started having brief convulsive episodes over the past week. His parents are both healthy with no medical conditions. On exam, the child demonstrates muscle rigidity and diffuse muscle wasting. He is unable to stand or sit up straight. His patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes are absent. Fundoscopic examination is unremarkable. A urine sample demonstrates metachromic granules. This patient’s condition is caused by a defect in which of the following enzymes?
Options:
(A): Alpha-galactosidase A
(B): Arylsulfatase A
(C): Beta-galactocerebrosidase
(D): Beta-glucocerebrosidase
(E): Hexosaminidase A
",Arylsulfatase A,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Arylsulfatase A.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and urine sample findings, this patient is most likely suffering from metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD), which is caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A. MLD is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of sulfatides in various tissues, including the central nervous system. The deficiency of arylsulfatase A leads to impaired degradation of sulfatides, resulting in their accumulation and subsequent damage to the myelin sheath. This leads to progressive demyelination and neurological symptoms, such as muscle weakness, muscle wasting, and loss of motor skills. The absence of reflexes (patellar, Achilles, and brachioradialis reflexes) is consistent with the neurological involvement seen in MLD. The presence of metachromic granules in the urine sample is a characteristic finding in MLD. 

The other enzyme deficiencies listed in the options are associated with different lysosomal storage disorders:
- Alpha-galactosidase A deficiency is seen in Fabry disease.
- Beta-galactocerebrosidase deficiency is seen in Krabbe disease.
- Beta-glucocerebrosidase deficiency is seen in Gaucher disease.
- Hexosaminidase A deficiency is seen in Tay-Sachs disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Arylsulfatase A.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider for two weeks of low-grade fever and sore throat. Upon further questioning, the patient is found to have unprotected sex with both men and women with 3-5 partners per month. On workup, he is found to have an HIV viral load of 15,000 copies/mL with a CD4+ of 170 cells/mm^3. He is started on medical therapy. What should be included in his medication regimen?
Options:
(A): Azithromycin
(B): Dapsone
(C): Fluconazole
(D): Folinic acid
(E): Tetrahydrofolic acid
",Folinic acid,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Folinic acid.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has a low CD4+ count of 170 cells/mm^3, indicating significant immunosuppression due to HIV infection. Patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/μL are at risk for opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Therefore, prophylactic treatment is necessary to prevent PCP.

The drug of choice for PCP prophylaxis in patients with HIV infection and CD4 counts below 200 cells/μL is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). TMP-SMX is highly effective in preventing PCP and is the preferred agent due to its broad-spectrum coverage against other opportunistic infections as well.

Folinic acid (also known as leucovorin) is not used for PCP prophylaxis. It is a medication that is used as an adjunct to certain chemotherapy regimens to reduce the toxic effects of methotrexate. It is not indicated for the treatment or prevention of PCP in patients with HIV infection.

Therefore, the correct medication to include in this patient's regimen for PCP prophylaxis would be trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), not folinic acid.",
"A 71-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of a pigmented lesion on her left foot. She has had decreased appetite and a 6-kg (13-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months. Physical examination shows that on the left medial ankle there is a 2-cm reddish-black nodule with a verrucous surface. A full-thickness excisional biopsy of the lesion shows S100-protein-positive epithelioid cells. A subsequent CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows metastases to the liver; a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma is made. Chemotherapy with aldesleukin is initiated. Which of the following is the mechanism of action for this drug?
Options:
(A): Stimulating release of acute-phase reactants
(B): Stimulating antigen-processing cells
(C): Inhibiting expression of MHC II and Th1 cytokines
(D): Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells
(E): Supporting growth of bone marrow stem cells
",Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Activating natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells.

Explanation:
Aldesleukin, also known as interleukin-2 (IL-2), is a cytokine that is used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. It works by activating natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells, which are important components of the immune system's response against cancer cells. NK cells are able to directly kill tumor cells, while cytotoxic T cells recognize and destroy cancer cells that display specific antigens. By activating these immune cells, aldesleukin enhances the body's ability to fight against the melanoma cells and may lead to tumor regression. This mechanism of action makes aldesleukin an immunotherapy drug for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.",
"A 27-year-old female presents to her physician with a palpable thyroid nodule. Iodine uptake testing shows that the nodule has decreased iodine uptake compared with the rest of the thyroid gland. A fine-needle aspiration is performed and the physician calls telling the patient that she has a neoplasm of the thyroid. Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?
Options:
(A): Papillary carcinoma
(B): Medullary carcinoma
(C): Follicular carcinoma
(D): Anaplastic carcinoma
(E): Hurthle cell carcinoma
",Papillary carcinoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Papillary carcinoma.

Explanation:
Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for about 80% of all cases. It typically occurs in young to middle-aged individuals, with a peak incidence in the third and fourth decades of life. In this case, the patient is a 27-year-old female, which is consistent with the demographic profile of papillary carcinoma.

The presentation of a palpable thyroid nodule is also consistent with papillary carcinoma, as it is often associated with a single nodule rather than diffuse enlargement of the thyroid gland.

The decreased iodine uptake in the nodule compared with the rest of the thyroid gland is another characteristic feature of papillary carcinoma. This is because papillary carcinoma cells lose the ability to concentrate iodine, leading to decreased uptake on iodine uptake testing.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the standard diagnostic procedure for evaluating thyroid nodules. In this case, the FNA confirmed the presence of a neoplasm, further supporting the diagnosis of papillary carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's demographic profile, clinical presentation, iodine uptake testing, and FNA results, the most likely diagnosis is papillary carcinoma.",
"A 58-year-old male presents with an acutely elevated blood pressure of 220/140 mmHg. The patient complains of a headache and chest pain, and he has been vomiting for the last several hours. Physical exam demonstrates papilledema and a depressed level of consciousness. To treat this patient's hypertensive emergency, he is started on an IV medication commonly used in this situation. The agent exerts its effect by releasing nitric oxide as a metabolite, which subsequently activates guanylate cyclase and increases production of cGMP in vascular smooth muscle. Which of the following clinical effects would be expected from administration of this medication?
Options:
(A): Decreased cardiac contractility
(B): Increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure
(C): Decreased stroke volume
(D): Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
(E): Increased systemic vascular resistance
",Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Decreased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.

Explanation:
The IV medication described in the scenario is likely nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator that releases nitric oxide as a metabolite. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, which increases the production of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle. 

By increasing cGMP levels, nitroglycerin causes relaxation of vascular smooth muscle, leading to vasodilation. This vasodilation primarily affects the venous system, reducing preload and decreasing left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. 

Decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure leads to a decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is a measure of left atrial pressure and is used as an indirect measure of left ventricular filling pressure. 

Therefore, administration of nitroglycerin would be expected to decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. This effect helps to reduce the workload on the heart and improve symptoms in hypertensive emergencies.",
"A 24-year-old woman delivers a baby at term. The Apgar counts are 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. Thirty minutes after delivery, the mother’s blood pressure drops to 80/60 mm Hg and her pulse is 124/min. On physical examination, her distal extremities are clammy and cold, and the uterus is boggy. Aggressive fluid resuscitation is initiated. After administering 4 units of IV fluids and 4 units of whole blood, her vitals stabilize. The next morning, she says she is unable to lactate when she tries to breastfeed her child. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient?
Options:
(A): Pituitary tumor
(B): Postpartum blues
(C): Remains of placenta in uterus
(D): Pituitary infarction
(E): Pituitary hemorrhage
",Pituitary infarction,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Pituitary infarction.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario experienced a significant drop in blood pressure and pulse rate after delivery, which suggests hypovolemic shock. This is supported by the findings of clammy and cold extremities and a boggy uterus, which are signs of inadequate blood flow and uterine atony, respectively. Aggressive fluid resuscitation was initiated to stabilize her vitals.

The most likely cause of the failure of lactation in this patient is pituitary infarction. Pituitary infarction can occur as a result of severe hypovolemic shock, which can lead to inadequate blood supply to the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland plays a crucial role in lactation by producing and releasing prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. If the pituitary gland is damaged or not functioning properly, it can result in the failure of lactation.

The other options are less likely causes in this scenario. A pituitary tumor would typically present with symptoms unrelated to the patient's presentation, such as visual disturbances or hormonal imbalances. Postpartum blues, which are transient mood changes after childbirth, would not directly affect lactation. Remains of placenta in the uterus could cause postpartum hemorrhage, but it would not directly affect lactation. Pituitary hemorrhage is a rare complication that can occur during childbirth, but it would typically present with more severe symptoms such as severe headache, visual disturbances, and altered mental status.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 3-day history of fatigue and yellow discoloration of his skin. One week ago, he had an upper respiratory tract infection. Examination shows jaundice of the skin and conjunctivae. The spleen tip is palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin. His hemoglobin concentration is 9.4 g/dl and his mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration is 39% Hb/cell. A Coombs test is negative. A peripheral blood smear is shown. This patient is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Malaria
(B): Acute myelogenous leukemia
(C): Cholecystitis
(D): Renal papillary necrosis
(E): Splenic sequestration crisis
",Cholecystitis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Cholecystitis.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is a 3-year-old boy with fatigue and yellow discoloration of the skin (jaundice), which are signs of liver dysfunction. The presence of jaundice and an enlarged spleen (palpated 2 cm below the left costal margin) suggests that the patient has hemolytic anemia. The peripheral blood smear shows evidence of hemolysis, with red blood cells that are smaller and more pale than normal (low mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration). The negative Coombs test indicates that the hemolysis is not immune-mediated.

In patients with chronic hemolysis, such as in this case, there is an increased risk of developing cholecystitis. Hemolysis leads to an increased production of bilirubin, which is excreted into the bile. The excess bilirubin can lead to the formation of gallstones, which can then cause inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). This is especially true in children with sickle cell disease, as they are at increased risk for both hemolysis and cholecystitis.

Therefore, the patient in this case is at greatest risk for cholecystitis (option C).",
"A 27-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a general checkup. She has been doing well in school and has no complaints. The patient has a past medical history of asthma which is controlled with albuterol. She is currently sexually active but states that she uses birth control. She has many friends and states that her mood is typically positive. The patient's last pap smear was 1 year ago. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 68, and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 65. Her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 147/108 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's BMI is 19 kg/m^2. Physical exam demonstrates a normal S1 and S2, normal breath sounds, and an abdominal exam that is within normal limits. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Colonoscopy
(B): Discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device
(C): Pap smear
(D): Pregnancy test
(E): Recommend weight loss
",Discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical exam findings, the most appropriate next step in management is to discontinue birth control and place an intrauterine device (IUD). The patient has a family history of colon and breast cancer, which may increase her risk for these conditions. However, at her age, routine screening for colon cancer is not recommended. Additionally, the patient's blood pressure is elevated, which may indicate hypertension. The use of hormonal birth control methods, such as oral contraceptives, can increase the risk of developing hypertension. Therefore, discontinuing birth control and considering a non-hormonal method, such as an IUD, would be the best next step. This will allow for further evaluation and management of the patient's blood pressure and potential risk factors for cancer. A pap smear is not indicated at this time, as the patient's last one was done 1 year ago and she has no complaints or symptoms that would warrant immediate screening. A pregnancy test is also not necessary, as the patient states that she is currently using birth control. Lastly, while the patient's BMI is on the lower side, recommending weight loss is not the most appropriate next step in management given the other findings and concerns in this patient.",
"A 25-year-old woman presents generalized abdominal pain and vomiting for the past hour. She has also had watery diarrhea for several days with no blood or pus in the stools. She is taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which she cannot remember the name of, and drinking oral rehydration solution, which has helped a little. Her past medical history shows she was hospitalized 10 years ago for an appendectomy and 4 years ago for a fractured ulna following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs are pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 14/min with shallow breathing, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, pupils are constricted. Extremities are pale and cold. The abdomen is soft but mildly, diffusely tender to palpation with a palpable bladder. No rebound or guarding. Fingerstick blood glucose is 124 mg/dL. Laboratory tests are pending. A urinary catheter is placed, and intravenous fluids are started. Abdominal imaging shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Administer naloxone
(B): Administer opioid analgesics
(C): Scopolamine patch
(D): Start dextrose infusion
(E): Perform a gastric lavage
",Administer naloxone,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Administer naloxone.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is opioid overdose. The patient has a history of taking an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medication, which commonly contains opioids such as loperamide. Opioid overdose can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. The constricted pupils and pale, cold extremities are consistent with opioid toxicity. Additionally, the patient's shallow breathing and elevated heart rate are signs of opioid overdose.

Naloxone is a specific opioid receptor antagonist that can rapidly reverse the effects of opioid overdose. Administering naloxone is the next best step in managing this patient to reverse the opioid toxicity and improve her symptoms. It is important to note that naloxone may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in patients who are physically dependent on opioids, so close monitoring is necessary.

The other options are not appropriate in this scenario:
(B) Administering opioid analgesics would worsen the patient's symptoms and exacerbate the opioid toxicity.
(C) Scopolamine patch is used for motion sickness and would not be effective in treating opioid overdose.
(D) Starting a dextrose infusion is not the next best step because the patient's blood glucose level is within the normal range.
(E) Performing a gastric lavage is not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms are consistent with opioid overdose rather than a toxic ingestion.",
"A 26-year-old man with no significant past medical history presents to the ED following a motor vehicle accident. Vital signs on presentation are T 99.0 F, BP 100/60 mmHg, HR 125 bpm, RR 16/min, SpO2 98% on room air. He complains of extreme abdominal pain worse in the left upper quadrant which has worsened over the past 30 minutes. Exam demonstrates abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, and tenderness on light percussion. Bedside sonography shows evidence for hemoperitoneum. Despite administering more intravenous fluids, repeat vitals are T 98.9 F, BP 82/50 mm hg, HR 180 bpm, RR 20/min, SpO2 97% on room air. Which of the following is the best next step?
Options:
(A): Normal saline bolus and re-evaluation of hemodynamics after infusion
(B): CT abdomen and pelvis
(C): Morphine
(D): Abdominal plain film
(E): Exploratory laparotomy
",Exploratory laparotomy,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Exploratory laparotomy.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with signs and symptoms consistent with a significant abdominal injury following a motor vehicle accident. The presence of extreme abdominal pain, abdominal wall rigidity, involuntary guarding, tenderness on light percussion, and evidence of hemoperitoneum on bedside sonography all suggest a serious intra-abdominal injury. 

The patient's vital signs are also concerning, with a drop in blood pressure (82/50 mmHg) and an elevated heart rate (180 bpm) despite receiving intravenous fluids. These findings indicate ongoing hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability. 

Given the severity of the patient's condition and the high likelihood of a life-threatening intra-abdominal injury, the best next step would be to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy. This surgical procedure allows for direct visualization and assessment of the abdominal organs and structures, and it can be used to identify and repair any injuries that may be causing the patient's symptoms and hemodynamic instability. 

Options A, B, C, and D are not the best next steps in this scenario. Normal saline bolus and re-evaluation of hemodynamics (Option A) may be appropriate in some cases of hypovolemia, but in this patient with ongoing hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability, immediate surgical intervention is necessary. CT abdomen and pelvis (Option B) may provide additional information about the extent of the injury, but it would delay definitive treatment. Morphine (Option C) may be considered for pain management, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and hemodynamic instability. Abdominal plain film (Option D) is not indicated in this scenario as it does not provide sufficient information to guide management in a patient with suspected intra-abdominal injury.",
"A 74-year-old man undergoes an open cholecystectomy. Surgery is performed under general anesthesia for which the patient is intubated with an endotracheal tube. Directly following the procedure, his temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg. He is extubated as soon as he showed signs of alertness. Five minutes later, he becomes unresponsive. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypertension. He underwent stenting of the right coronary artery 10 years ago. He smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 40 years but quit 2 weeks ago for surgery. He drinks one to two beers daily. His current medications include metformin, enalapril, aspirin, atorvastatin, and a multivitamin. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry shows an oxygen saturation of 73%. He is put on a non-rebreather mask with an FiO2 of 100%. Three minutes later, he is still unresponsive. His arterial blood gas analysis shows:
pH 7.32
PCO2 33 mm Hg
PO2 73 mm Hg
HCO3 22 mEq/L
O2 saturation 73%
Which of the following is the best next step in the management of this patient?""
Options:
(A): Perform tracheostomy
(B): Continue using the non-rebreather mask
(C): Reintubate
(D): Close observation only
(E): Start BiPAP
",Reintubate,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Reintubate.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is experiencing respiratory failure, as evidenced by his unresponsiveness and low oxygen saturation despite being on a non-rebreather mask with 100% FiO2. The arterial blood gas analysis shows a low PO2 of 73 mm Hg, indicating hypoxemia. Additionally, the patient's respiratory rate is within normal range, suggesting that the cause of his respiratory failure is not due to hypoventilation.

Given the patient's history of coronary artery disease and stenting, it is important to consider the possibility of acute myocardial infarction (MI) as the cause of his respiratory failure. Acute MI can lead to cardiogenic pulmonary edema, which can present with hypoxemia and respiratory distress. The patient's risk factors for coronary artery disease, such as smoking and hypertension, further support this possibility.

Reintubation is the best next step in the management of this patient because it allows for better control of the airway and ventilation. Reintubation can help improve oxygenation and provide respiratory support while further evaluation and treatment are initiated. It is important to address the underlying cause of the respiratory failure, such as acute MI, and provide appropriate interventions.

Performing a tracheostomy (option A) is not indicated at this time as the patient's airway can still be managed with endotracheal intubation. Continuing to use the non-rebreather mask (option B) is not sufficient to improve the patient's oxygenation given his low oxygen saturation. Close observation only (option D) is not appropriate as the patient is unresponsive and requires immediate intervention. Starting BiPAP (option E) may not be effective in this case as the patient is unresponsive and may not be able to tolerate the mask. Obtaining an electrocardiogram (option F) is important to evaluate for acute MI, but it should not delay the immediate intervention of reintubation.",
"An 11-month-old male infant is brought to his pediatrician by his mother. She is concerned about his leg and his inability to stand. He was born vaginally to a 33-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 2) from an uncomplicated pregnancy at 39 weeks. He has met all developmental milestones and is up to date on all vaccinations. His mother explains that he can normally stand without help and can walk briefly on his own. However, he hit his right leg against a chair 2 days ago. The area became edematous and bruised overtime and the infant became unable to stand or crawl and cries when he puts weight on it. The mother denies any child abuse from her family or child care. The patient’s vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 80/40 mm Hg, heart rate 137/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and temperature 36.7°C (97.0°F). His length and weight are both between the 15th and 25th percentile. On physical examination, blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae are noted. Respiratory, cardiovascular, and abdominal examinations are within normal limits for his age. There is joint hypermobility and decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities. The patient’s right calf appears slightly deformed, edematous, and warm to the tough. The patient begins to cry loudly when the physician palpates his leg. The patient’s X-ray shows an incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis. What is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Child abuse
(B): Insufficient production of procollagen type 1
(C): Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1
(D): Defective collagen type 3
(E): Dysfunctional structure of laminins
",Insufficient production of procollagen type 1,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Insufficient production of procollagen type 1.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including the inability to stand, edema and bruising after a minor injury, joint hypermobility, decreased tone in both upper and lower extremities, and blue-grayish discoloration of the sclerae, are consistent with a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). OI is a genetic disorder characterized by defective synthesis of type 1 collagen, which is the major component of bone, skin, and other connective tissues. The most common form of OI is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which encode the alpha chains of type 1 collagen. These mutations result in insufficient production of procollagen type 1, leading to weak and brittle bones that are prone to fractures. In this case, the incomplete fracture of the right tibial diaphysis seen on X-ray is consistent with OI. Child abuse (option A) is unlikely in this case, as the mother denies any history of abuse and the patient's symptoms are consistent with a genetic disorder. Mutation in the gene encoding fibrillin-1 (option C) is associated with Marfan syndrome, which is characterized by tall stature, arachnodactyly, aortic root dilation, and lens dislocation, but not with the symptoms described in this patient. Defective collagen type 3 (option D) is associated with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which is characterized by thin, translucent skin, easy bruising, and arterial rupture, but not with the symptoms described in this patient. Dysfunctional structure of laminins (option E) is associated with congenital muscular dystrophy, which is characterized by muscle weakness and hypotonia, but not with the symptoms described in this patient.",
"A 21-year-old man comes to the emergency room with swelling and severe pain in his left lower leg that started 2 hours ago. He has no history of serious illness or trauma. His father has a history of pulmonary embolism. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily since he started college 3 years ago. He appears very distressed. He is 173 cm (5 ft 8 in) tall and weighs 92 kg (203 lb); BMI is 30.7 kg/m2. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 94/min, respirations are 17/min, and blood pressure is 130/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg; dorsiflexion of the left foot causes severe pain in the calf. Laboratory studies show a platelet count of 184,000/mm3, a prothrombin time of 11 seconds, an activated partial thromboplastin time of 26 seconds, and positive fibrin split products. Ultrasonography of the left leg shows incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow. The patient is administered a 5000 IU intravenous bolus of unfractionated heparin followed by a constant infusion. Six hours later, the activated partial thromboplastin time is 30 seconds. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Hyperhomocysteinemia
(B): Antithrombin III deficiency
(C): Factor V Leiden
(D): Protein C deficiency
(E): Antiphospholipid syndrome
",Antithrombin III deficiency,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Antithrombin III deficiency.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is characterized by swelling, severe pain, and tenderness in the affected limb. The risk factors for DVT in this patient include smoking, obesity (BMI >30), and a positive family history of pulmonary embolism. The physical examination findings of a tender and mildly swollen left lower leg, along with the positive ultrasound findings of incompressibility of the popliteal vein with a hyperechoic mass and absent blood flow, further support the diagnosis of DVT.

The laboratory studies show a normal platelet count, a normal prothrombin time, and an elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which suggests a deficiency in one of the natural anticoagulant proteins. Antithrombin III is one of these proteins and is responsible for inhibiting thrombin and other coagulation factors. Deficiency of antithrombin III leads to a hypercoagulable state and an increased risk of venous thromboembolism. The administration of unfractionated heparin, which potentiates the activity of antithrombin III, is the treatment of choice for acute DVT.

Hyperhomocysteinemia (choice A) is a risk factor for arterial thrombosis, not venous thrombosis.

Factor V Leiden (choice C) is the most common inherited cause of hypercoagulability, but it is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, not arterial thrombosis.

Protein C deficiency (choice D) is another inherited cause of hypercoagulability, but it typically presents in childhood or early adulthood with recurrent venous thromboembolism. It is not associated with arterial thrombosis.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (choice E) is characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, such as lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies. It is associated with both arterial and venous thrombosis, but the presentation is typically more chronic and recurrent, rather than acute.",
"An 80-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of fatigue and lightheadedness. He does not have chest pain, palpitations, or difficulty breathing. He has a history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, osteoarthritis, and asthma. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, lisinopril, albuterol, and ibuprofen. His pulse is 48/min and blood pressure is 89/50 mm Hg. He responds slowly to questions but is oriented to person, place, and time. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. His lungs are clear to auscultation and bowel sounds are positive with no pulsatile masses or bruits. Pedal pulses are nonpalpable, distal extremities are cold, and capillary refill time is 4 seconds. An ECG shows left axis deviation, a Q wave in lead III, a constant PR interval of 0.15 seconds with every third P wave that is nonconducted, and a QRS interval of .09 seconds. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Dopamine
(B): Dobutamine
(C): Norepinephrine
(D): Cardiac pacing
(E): Epinephrine
",Cardiac pacing,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Cardiac pacing.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and ECG findings, the most likely diagnosis is symptomatic bradycardia with third-degree heart block. The patient's slow pulse rate, low blood pressure, and cold extremities suggest poor cardiac output and inadequate perfusion. Cardiac pacing is the most appropriate next step in management to restore a normal heart rate and improve perfusion. Dopamine, dobutamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are all vasopressor medications that can increase heart rate and blood pressure, but they do not address the underlying conduction abnormality. Cardiac pacing directly addresses the conduction abnormality and is the definitive treatment for symptomatic bradycardia.",
"In a small town with a population of 10,000 people, the prevalence of alcohol use is estimated to be 30%. A study is done with a null hypothesis that there is no association between alcohol use and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The data obtained shows, of the 200 alcoholics who were followed-up, 30 developed GERD; and out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. What fraction of GERD can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed in this town?
Options:
(A): 45/195
(B): 39/400
(C): 30/400
(D): (30/200) / (30/400)
(E): 30/200
",45/195,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) 45/195.

Explanation:
To determine the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed, we need to compare the proportion of GERD cases in alcoholics to the proportion of GERD cases in non-alcoholics.

In the study, out of the 200 alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. This means that the proportion of GERD cases among alcoholics is 30/200 = 0.15.

Out of the 400 non-alcoholics, 30 developed GERD. This means that the proportion of GERD cases among non-alcoholics is 30/400 = 0.075.

To calculate the fraction of GERD that can be prevented, we subtract the proportion of GERD cases among non-alcoholics from the proportion of GERD cases among alcoholics:

0.15 - 0.075 = 0.075.

Therefore, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed is 0.075.

To convert this fraction to a simplified form, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 15:

0.075 = 75/1000 = 3/40.

So, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed is 3/40.

However, the question asks for the fraction in the form of a fraction with a numerator and denominator. To convert 3/40 to this form, we multiply both the numerator and denominator by 5:

3/40 * 5/5 = 15/200.

Therefore, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed is 15/200.

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 5:

15/200 = 3/40.

So, the fraction of GERD that can be prevented in the general population if alcohol is no longer consumed is 3/40, which is equivalent to 15/200.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) 45/195.",
"A 41-year-old man presents to the clinic with the complaints of abdominal discomfort and cramping for the past 4 months. He also mentions that he has grossly bloody stool and most of the time an urge to defecate. He has a history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago. He admits having lost about 5 lb in the past month. His temperature is 37° C (98.6° F), respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse is 77/min, and blood pressure is 105/86 mm Hg. On physical examination, a mild conjunctival pallor is evident, and the rectum is erythematous, indurated, and tender. Colonoscopy demonstrates continuous mucosal lesions throughout the rectum to the hepatic flexure of the colon. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Ulcerative colitis
(B): Celiac disease
(C): Irritable bowel syndrome
(D): Crohn’s disease
(E): Laxative abuse
",Ulcerative colitis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Ulcerative colitis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, cramping, grossly bloody stool, and an urge to defecate are consistent with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The continuous mucosal lesions seen on colonoscopy, along with the erythematous, indurated, and tender rectum, further support the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis.

Celiac disease (B) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune reaction to gluten, leading to damage to the small intestine. It typically presents with symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, and malabsorption, but does not cause the continuous mucosal lesions seen in this patient.

Irritable bowel syndrome (C) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. It does not typically cause grossly bloody stool or mucosal lesions.

Crohn's disease (D) is another form of IBD, but it typically involves skip lesions and can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. The continuous mucosal lesions seen in this patient are more consistent with ulcerative colitis.

Laxative abuse (E) may cause gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort and cramping, but it would not explain the presence of grossly bloody stool or the mucosal lesions seen on colonoscopy. Additionally, the patient's history of bulimia with laxative abuse several years ago is not sufficient to explain the current symptoms and findings.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to your office with a 2-year history of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation. He has been evaluated by several practitioners, who have all prescribed antimicrobial therapy, including ciprofloxacin, with no improvement and leading to emotional distress and sleep disturbances. The physical examination is unremarkable, except for a mildly tender prostate, without masses or nodules. There are no testicular masses, hernias, or hemorrhoids. Additionally to this health issue, you have also been following him for recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability, with all test results within the normal range thus far. A summary of recent tests is shown in the following table:
Urine test
Sample White cells Culture
Mid-stream urine Negative Negative
Expressed prostatic secretion Positive Negative
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Benign prostatic hyperplasia
(B): Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis
(C): Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis
(D): Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli
(E): Interstitial cystitis
","Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Chronic, non-bacterial prostatitis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of moderate-to-severe pelvic pain, irritative voiding urinary symptoms (frequency and dysuria), and occasional frank blood in his semen with painful ejaculation, along with a mildly tender prostate on physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is chronic prostatitis.

The negative culture results from both the mid-stream urine and expressed prostatic secretion samples suggest that the prostatitis is non-bacterial in nature. Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis is a common condition characterized by persistent pelvic pain and urinary symptoms without evidence of infection. It is often a diagnosis of exclusion, as other causes of similar symptoms, such as urinary tract infections or sexually transmitted infections, have been ruled out.

The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, periods of constipation and diarrhea, and fatigability may also be indicative of a concurrent condition such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which is commonly associated with chronic prostatitis.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is unlikely in this patient as there are no symptoms suggestive of urinary obstruction or enlargement of the prostate on physical examination.

Acute prostatitis by Chlamydia trachomatis is less likely in this patient as the symptoms have been present for 2 years, which is not consistent with an acute infection.

Chronic prostatitis by resistant Escherichia coli is also less likely as the culture results were negative for both the mid-stream urine and expressed prostatic secretion samples.

Interstitial cystitis is a possibility, but it is less likely than chronic non-bacterial prostatitis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Interstitial cystitis is characterized by chronic pelvic pain, urinary urgency, and frequency, but it typically does not present with blood in the semen or painful ejaculation. Additionally, the mildly tender prostate on physical examination suggests involvement of the prostate gland, which is more consistent with chronic prostatitis.",
"An 18-year-old male presents to the emergency department trauma bay with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. The patient undergoes an exploratory laparotomy, during which, it is discovered that his splenic artery was damaged at its origin from the celiac trunk. The surgeon ligates the splenic artery at its origin. Which of the following arteries will now be hypoperfused as a result?
Options:
(A): Left gastric artery
(B): Gastroduodenal artery
(C): Right gastroepiploic artery
(D): Left gastroepiploic artery
(E): Common hepatic artery
",Left gastroepiploic artery,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Left gastroepiploic artery.

Explanation:
The splenic artery gives rise to several branches, including the left gastroepiploic artery. When the splenic artery is ligated at its origin, blood flow to the left gastroepiploic artery is compromised, leading to hypoperfusion of this artery. The left gastroepiploic artery runs along the greater curvature of the stomach and anastomoses with the right gastroepiploic artery, which is a branch of the gastroduodenal artery. The left gastroepiploic artery supplies blood to the greater curvature of the stomach, and its hypoperfusion can result in ischemia of this region. The other arteries listed in the options are not directly affected by ligating the splenic artery at its origin from the celiac trunk.",

Based on the information provided, the mother has known hepatitis B, which puts the newborn at risk of becoming a chronic carrier of the virus. The best course of action for the newborn is to administer hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) as soon as possible after birth.

The presence of HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) should be determined in all pregnant women. If the result is positive, the infant should receive HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth, followed by two subsequent vaccine doses at 1 and 6 months of age.

Administering HBIG and hepatitis B vaccine to infants at delivery can reduce transmission by at least 95 percent. The most important risk factors for transmission, despite prophylaxis, appear to be a positive hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the mother and a high maternal HBV viral load.

Therefore, the best course of action for the newborn child in this case is to administer hepatitis B vaccine and HBIG to reduce the risk of transmission and prevent the development of chronic hepatitis B infection.",
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with a cough. He states that 2 weeks ago, he had a fever, chills, and a cough, which his primary doctor treated with acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and rest. Since then, the patient’s symptoms have resolved with the exception of a chronic cough and a small amount of clear sputum that is occasionally laced with blood. The patient denies chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, or chills. The patient is otherwise healthy and is currently taking metformin and albuterol. His temperature is 98.3°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 129/75 mmHg, pulse is 84/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for bilateral clear breath sounds, absence of lymphadenopathy on HEENT exam, and a normal oropharynx. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Chest radiograph
(B): CT angiogram
(C): D-dimer
(D): Sputum culture
(E): Supportive care
",Supportive care,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Supportive care.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is post-infectious cough. The patient had a recent upper respiratory tract infection with fever, chills, and cough, which has now resolved except for a chronic cough and occasional blood-tinged sputum. The absence of other concerning symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or fever, along with normal physical examination findings, makes it unlikely that the patient has a serious underlying condition.

Post-infectious cough is a common condition that can occur after a viral or bacterial respiratory infection. It is characterized by a persistent cough that lasts for several weeks after the initial infection has resolved. The cough is usually dry or produces minimal sputum and can be exacerbated by irritants such as cold air or exercise. Blood-tinged sputum can occur due to irritation of the airways during coughing.

The best next step in management for this patient is supportive care. This includes reassurance, education about the self-limited nature of post-infectious cough, and symptomatic treatment to alleviate the cough. Symptomatic treatment options may include over-the-counter cough suppressants, hydration, and avoidance of irritants. Antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of signs of a bacterial infection. Imaging studies such as chest radiograph or CT angiogram are not necessary in the absence of concerning symptoms or physical examination findings. D-dimer testing is used to evaluate for pulmonary embolism and is not indicated in this patient. Sputum culture is not necessary as the patient's symptoms are consistent with post-infectious cough and there are no signs of a bacterial infection.",
"A 64-year-old man with multiple sclerosis comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of urinary incontinence. The urge to urinate occurs suddenly, and he often is unable to make it to the bathroom before leaking urine. He has no incontinence with coughing or laughing. Digital rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Ultrasonography shows a normal post-void residual volume. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's incontinence?
Options:
(A): Doxazosin
(B): Midodrine
(C): Rivastigmine
(D): Mirtazapine
(E): Tolterodine
",Tolterodine,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Tolterodine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of sudden urge to urinate and inability to make it to the bathroom before leaking urine are consistent with urge incontinence. Urge incontinence is caused by detrusor overactivity, which is characterized by involuntary contractions of the bladder muscle. The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for urge incontinence is an anticholinergic or antimuscarinic medication, which relaxes the detrusor muscle and reduces bladder contractions.

Among the options given, tolterodine is the most appropriate choice for this patient. Tolterodine is an antimuscarinic medication that is commonly used to treat urge incontinence. It works by blocking the muscarinic receptors in the bladder, thereby reducing bladder contractions and improving urinary control.

Doxazosin (A) is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that is used to treat symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and hypertension. It does not directly target the detrusor muscle and is not the most appropriate choice for urge incontinence.

Midodrine (B) is an alpha-1 adrenergic agonist that is used to treat orthostatic hypotension. It does not have a direct effect on the detrusor muscle and is not the most appropriate choice for urge incontinence.

Rivastigmine (C) is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is used to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors can actually provoke urge incontinence by blocking the metabolism of acetylcholine. Therefore, rivastigmine is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's urge incontinence.

Mirtazapine (D) is an antidepressant that has anticholinergic properties. While it may have some effect on reducing bladder contractions, it is not specifically indicated for the treatment of urge incontinence. Tolterodine, which is a more specific antimuscarinic medication, would be a better choice for this patient.",
"A 42-year-old woman with a history of depression and headaches presents to the emergency room with severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head beginning 12 hours ago. She last took ibuprofen 2 hours ago but did not feel any improvement in the pain. She has been nauseous and unable to get out of bed and is currently laying in the dark with the lights off. Her depression has improved, and she has stopped taking her sertraline 2 months ago. Other than ibuprofen as needed, she is not currently taking any additional medications. Which of the following would be the best treatment for her acute symptoms?
Options:
(A): No treatment necessary
(B): 100% oxygen
(C): Propranolol
(D): Sumatriptan
(E): Amitriptyline
",Sumatriptan,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Sumatriptan.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of severe, pulsating pain around the crown of her head, along with nausea and inability to get out of bed, she is most likely experiencing a migraine headache. Migraine headaches are often characterized by these symptoms and can be debilitating.

Sumatriptan is a medication that belongs to a class of drugs called triptans, which are specifically used for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. It works by narrowing the blood vessels in the brain and reducing inflammation, thereby relieving the pain and other symptoms associated with migraines.

The other options are not the best treatment for acute migraine symptoms in this case:

(A) No treatment necessary: Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the impact on her daily functioning, it is not appropriate to leave her without any treatment.

(B) 100% oxygen: While oxygen therapy can be effective for certain types of headaches, such as cluster headaches, it is not the first-line treatment for migraines.

(C) Propranolol: Propranolol is a medication commonly used for the prevention of migraines, but it is not typically used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

(E) Amitriptyline: Amitriptyline is an antidepressant medication that can be used for the prevention of migraines, but it is not typically used for the acute treatment of migraine attacks.

Therefore, the best treatment option for this patient's acute migraine symptoms would be (D) Sumatriptan.",
"A pulmonologist is analyzing the vital signs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented to an emergency room with respiratory distress and subsequently required intubation.

(B): 32 breaths per minute
(C): 10 breaths per minute
(D): 27.7 breaths per minute
(E): 26 breaths per minute
",32 breaths per minute,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) 32 breaths per minute.

Explanation:
The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a set of data. In this case, the respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute appears three times, which is more than any other value. Therefore, the mode of these respiratory rates is 32 breaths per minute.",
"A 17-year-old high school student was in shop class when he accidentally sawed off his pointer finger while making a bird house. He fainted when he realized his finger had been cut off. The teacher immediately transported the patient to the emergency department and he arrived within 20 minutes. He has a past medical history of asthma, and his only medication is an albuterol inhaler. The patient's current blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg. Analgesics are administered. The teacher states that he left the amputated finger in the classroom, but that the principal would be transporting it to the hospital. Which of the following is the correct method of transporting the amputated finger?
Options:
(A): Submerge the finger in ice water
(B): Wrap the finger in moist gauze
(C): Wrap the finger in moist gauze and place on ice
(D): Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice
(E): Wrap the finger in moist gauze and submerge in ice water
","Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice",Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Wrap finger in moist gauze, put in a plastic bag, and place on ice.

Explanation: 
When transporting an amputated finger, it is important to handle it carefully to maximize the chances of successful reattachment. The correct method of transporting the amputated finger is to wrap it in moist gauze, put it in a plastic bag, and place it on ice. 

The moist gauze helps to keep the finger tissue hydrated and prevent it from drying out. This is important for preserving the viability of the tissue. Wrapping the finger in a plastic bag helps to protect it from contamination and further injury. Placing the bag on ice helps to keep the finger cool, which can slow down the metabolic processes and reduce tissue damage. 

It is important to note that direct contact with ice should be avoided, as this can cause frostbite and further damage to the tissue. The finger should be wrapped in moist gauze before being placed on ice to provide a barrier between the ice and the finger.",
"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because she has not had menstrual bleeding for the past 3 months. Menses had previously occurred at irregular 15–45 day intervals with moderate to heavy flow. Menarche was at the age of 14 years. She started having sexual intercourse with her boyfriend about 3 months ago. Six months ago she had a manic episode, which was treated with risperidone. Her mother has PCOS and her father has diabetes mellitus. She is very conscious of her weight and appearance. She is 171 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 79 kg (174 lb); BMI is 27.02 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 60/min, and blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Pelvic examination shows a normal vagina and cervix. Serum hormone studies show:
Prolactin 16 ng/mL
Thyroid-stimulating hormone 3.8 μU/mL
Follicle-stimulating hormone 6 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 5.1 mIU/mL
Progesterone 0.8 ng/mL (follicular N <3; luteal N >3–5)
Testosterone 2.2 nmol/L (N <3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Uterine fibroids
(B): Congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts
(C): Purging behavior
(D): Polycystic ovaries
(E): Anovulation
",Anovulation,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Anovulation.

Explanation:
This patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with anovulation. Anovulation is the most common cause of irregular menstrual cycles in adolescents. It occurs when the ovaries do not release an egg during the menstrual cycle. This can result in missed periods or irregular bleeding patterns. Risk factors for anovulation include obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and a family history of menstrual irregularities. 

In this case, the patient's BMI is 27.02 kg/m2, which indicates that she is overweight. Her mother has PCOS, which is a common cause of anovulation. Additionally, her hormone studies show normal levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which suggests that the problem is not with the pituitary gland. The negative urine pregnancy test rules out pregnancy as the cause of her missed periods.

The other options are less likely causes in this patient. Uterine fibroids (A) are benign tumors of the uterus that can cause heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding, but they are less likely in this case because the patient's bleeding was previously moderate to heavy. A congenital defect of the Mullerian ducts (B) would typically present with more significant abnormalities on pelvic examination. Purging behavior (C) can cause menstrual irregularities, but it is not suggested by the patient's history or physical examination findings. Polycystic ovaries (D) can cause anovulation, but the patient's hormone studies do not show the typical hormonal imbalances seen in PCOS. Drug-induced hypogonadism (F) is a possibility given the patient's history of risperidone use, but the hormone studies do not support this diagnosis. Primary ovarian insufficiency (G) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of symptoms suggestive of ovarian failure.",
"A 21-year-old woman presents with sudden onset of high blood pressure. She is concerned about her health especially after her colleagues noticed that her face gets red at times while at work. She has even started to use blankets to cover her feet, even on the warmest days in the summer, even though her hands feel warm to the touch. She is a student who exercises and eats a well-balanced diet every day. There is no family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes. On examination, her blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, respirations are 19/min, pulse is 64/min, and temperature is 36.7°C (98.0°F). An echocardiogram is ordered for investigation. This patient is likely affected by a condition which is associated with which of the following options?
Options:
(A): Fibromuscular dysplasia
(B): Marfan syndrome
(C): Turner syndrome
(D): Pheochromocytoma
(E): Takayasu's arteritis
",Turner syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Turner syndrome.

Explanation:
Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by the absence or abnormality of one of the X chromosomes. It is associated with various physical and medical features, including high blood pressure (hypertension). In this case, the sudden onset of high blood pressure in a young woman without a family history of hypertension or other metabolic syndromes is suggestive of Turner syndrome.

The patient's symptoms of facial flushing and the need to cover her feet with blankets, even in warm weather, suggest autonomic dysfunction, which can be seen in Turner syndrome. This autonomic dysfunction can lead to abnormal regulation of blood pressure and temperature.

An echocardiogram is ordered to investigate any potential cardiac abnormalities that may be associated with Turner syndrome, such as coarctation of the aorta or bicuspid aortic valve.

Fibromuscular dysplasia (option A) is a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic vascular disease that primarily affects the renal arteries. It is not typically associated with the symptoms described in the patient.

Marfan syndrome (option B) is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue and can lead to various cardiovascular abnormalities, such as aortic root dilation. While Marfan syndrome can cause cardiovascular issues, it is not typically associated with sudden onset hypertension or the autonomic dysfunction described in the patient.

Pheochromocytoma (option D) is a rare tumor of the adrenal glands that secretes excessive amounts of catecholamines, leading to episodic hypertension. However, the patient's symptoms and lack of family history make pheochromocytoma less likely in this case.

Takayasu's arteritis (option E) is a rare inflammatory disease that primarily affects the large arteries, particularly the aorta and its branches. While it can cause hypertension, it typically presents with other symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and muscle pain. The patient's symptoms and lack of systemic features make Takayasu's arteritis less likely in this case.",
"A 52-year-old man presents to the physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough. He was recently diagnosed with stage 3 embryonal carcinoma testicular cancer. Following an orchiectomy, he was placed on chemotherapy. Cardiopulmonary examination shows fine inspiratory crackles bilaterally. There is clubbing present in the fingers bilaterally. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show FVC is 78% of expected and FEV1/FVC ratio is 92%. A CT scan of the chest is shown. Which of the following drugs is responsible for the patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Bleomycin
(B): Carboplatin
(C): Cisplatin
(D): Ifosfamide
(E): Methotrexate
",Bleomycin,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bleomycin.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and nonproductive cough, along with the physical examination findings of fine inspiratory crackles and clubbing, are consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity is a known side effect of bleomycin, a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used in the treatment of testicular cancer. Bleomycin-induced pulmonary toxicity can present as pneumonitis or fibrosis, and it typically occurs within the first year of treatment. The CT scan of the chest may show interstitial infiltrates or fibrotic changes. Pulmonary function tests may reveal a restrictive pattern, as seen in this patient with a decreased FVC (forced vital capacity) and a normal FEV1/FVC ratio. Carboplatin, cisplatin, ifosfamide, and methotrexate are not typically associated with pulmonary toxicity.",
"A 72-year-old man develops reduced urine output and a serum creatinine concentration of 2.9 mg/dL three days after being hospitalized for acute diverticulitis. On admission, a complete blood count showed a hemoglobin concentration of 15.5 g/dL and a leukocyte count of 14,000/mm3. Urinalysis showed 2+ proteinuria, and serum studies showed a blood glucose of 145 mg/dL and a creatinine concentration of 1.2 mg/dL. A CT scan of the abdomen confirmed the diagnosis. Therapy with intravenous ketoprofen, piperacillin, and tazobactam was begun, and the patient was placed on bowel rest. He has a history of hypertension, chronic constipation, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Prior to admission, his medications were insulin, metoprolol, and losartan. Today, his temperature is 37.7°C (99.9°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 135/87 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft on physical examination, and there is tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current renal findings?
Options:
(A): Gastrointestinal blood loss
(B): Adverse drug reaction
(C): Dehydration
(D): Contrast administration
(E): Chronic hypertension
""
",Contrast administration,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Contrast administration.

Explanation:
The patient's reduced urine output and elevated serum creatinine concentration suggest acute kidney injury (AKI). The most likely cause of AKI in this patient is contrast administration. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a well-known complication of contrast-enhanced imaging studies, such as CT scans. Risk factors for CIN include preexisting renal impairment, diabetes mellitus, and older age. This patient has multiple risk factors, including a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and being 72 years old. The timing of the onset of reduced urine output and elevated serum creatinine concentration, three days after contrast administration, is consistent with the development of CIN. Other causes of AKI, such as gastrointestinal blood loss, adverse drug reactions, dehydration, and chronic hypertension, are less likely in this patient given the clinical presentation and history provided.",
"An immunology expert is delivering a talk on innate immunity. While talking about inflammasomes, he describes the process via an example: products of cellular stress are detected by NLRP3, which includes NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3; the latter interacts with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) via the pyrin domain, which leads to the formation of a protein speck that consists of multimers of ASC dimers. Which of the following enzymes will be activated as the next step in the process?
Options:
(A): Adenosine deaminase
(B): Caspase 1
(C): Protein kinase C
(D): Protein phosphatase
(E): Tyrosine kinase
",Caspase 1,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Caspase 1.

Explanation:
Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that activate the enzyme caspase 1. In this example, the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC leads to the formation of a protein speck that consists of multimers of ASC dimers. The CARD domains of these multimerized ASC proteins then mediate the activation of caspase 1. Caspase 1 is responsible for the proteolytic processing of immature forms of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 to their mature, active forms. Therefore, caspase 1 is the enzyme that will be activated as the next step in the process.",
"The ribosome is an essential organelle that plays an important role in the synthesis of new proteins. The location of the ribosome within the cell can vary and provides a clue to the function of the particular cell. What ribosome location is essential for protein-secreting cells?
Options:
(A): Rough endoplasmic reticulum
(B): Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
(C): Cytosol
(D): Cell membrane
(E): Nucleus
",Rough endoplasmic reticulum,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Rough endoplasmic reticulum.

Explanation:
Protein-secreting cells require the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) as the essential location for ribosomes. The RER is characterized by large numbers of ribosomes attached to its outer surfaces. These ribosomes synthesize proteins that are extruded into the lumen of the RER or become integrated into the RER membrane. The RER is the site of synthesis for proteins that are destined to be secreted from the cell or to be membrane proteins. These proteins are translocated through a protein-lined channel in the RER membrane. Therefore, the RER is crucial for the synthesis and processing of proteins that are intended for secretion.",
"A patient presents to the emergency department with severe pain in her head. She states that the pain started 1 hour ago after rugby practice. Typically, she takes a special medication for bad headaches, but this time she took 2 doses and noticed no improvement in her symptoms. The patient's current medications that she can recall include sumatriptan and naproxen. She has been admitted to the hospital several times recently for panic attacks and suicide attempts. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 129/65 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 15/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. The patient is given dihydroergotamine, IV fluids, and is started on 100% oxygen. Two hours later, the patient demonstrates slurring of her speech. On physical exam there is drooping of the left side of her mouth, and her left upper extremity demonstrates 2/5 strength. A head CT is ordered. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's current presentation?
Options:
(A): Hemorrhagic stroke
(B): Ischemic stroke secondary to a thrombus
(C): Medication reaction
(D): Psychogenic symptoms
(E): Subarachnoid hemorrhage
",Medication reaction,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Medication reaction.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and presentation, a medication reaction is the most likely cause of her current symptoms. The patient has a history of taking sumatriptan and naproxen for her headaches, and she took 2 doses of her medication this time without any improvement in her symptoms. The slurring of speech, drooping of the left side of her mouth, and weakness in her left upper extremity are consistent with neurological symptoms, which can be caused by a medication reaction.

Both sumatriptan and naproxen can have side effects, including neurological symptoms such as slurred speech and weakness. Sumatriptan is a medication used to treat migraines, and it works by constricting blood vessels in the brain. However, it can also cause vasoconstriction in other blood vessels, leading to potential side effects. Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can also have side effects, including neurological symptoms.

Given the patient's history of panic attacks and suicide attempts, it is important to consider the possibility of a medication reaction rather than a stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. Psychogenic symptoms are less likely in this case, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a neurological deficit rather than a purely psychological manifestation.

A head CT is ordered to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a hemorrhagic stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, a medication reaction is the most likely cause based on the patient's history and presentation.",
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine gynecological examination and to refill her birth control pills. Her last pap smear at age 22 showed no intraepithelial lesions nor malignancy of the cervical cells. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 4 days. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She is sexually active with one male partner. Her father died of colon cancer at the age of 75 years and her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 40 years. She mentions that she is planning a backpacking trip through Europe in 2 months. Her routine immunizations are all up-to-date. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.5°F) and her blood pressure is 94/58 mm Hg. Pelvic and speculum examination show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the best recommendation for the patient at this time?
Options:
(A): Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening
(B): Beta-hCG urine test
(C): Repeat Pap smear
(D): Mammography
(E): No further testing is necessary
",Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis screening.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's age, sexual activity, and the absence of abnormalities on pelvic and speculum examination, the best recommendation for this patient is to undergo screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. These are common sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can be asymptomatic and can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Screening for these infections is recommended for sexually active individuals, especially those under the age of 25. Additionally, the patient's upcoming backpacking trip through Europe increases her risk of exposure to STIs. Therefore, screening for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis is the most appropriate recommendation at this time.",
"A 27-year-old man presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use. His current medications include albuterol and ibuprofen. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 70/35 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 19/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On initial trauma evaluation, his airway is intact and he is breathing spontaneously. The patient's dorsalis pedis and radial pulses are palpable bilaterally. His Glasgow Coma Scale is 9. Head to toe examination reveals instability of the pelvis when downwards force is applied. The patient is started on IV fluids and norepinephrine, and a pelvic binder is placed. The patient's vitals are measured again and his temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 100/55 mmHg, pulse is 150/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. A blood transfusion is started, and the patient is given hydromorphone. The patient suddenly becomes short of breath with notable bilateral wheezing with poor air movement. His blood pressure is 60/35 mmHg and pulse is 160/min. The patient is treated appropriately, intubated, stabilized, and transferred to the surgical intensive care unit. Which of the following is most likely to be found in this patient's history?
Options:
(A): Hemolytic anemia and ataxia
(B): Gum disease and poor wound healing
(C): Irregularly irregular heart rhythm
(D): Hepatitis C infection
(E): Anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum
",Hemolytic anemia and ataxia,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Hemolytic anemia and ataxia.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and presentation, the most likely condition to be found in this patient's history is hemolytic anemia and ataxia. The patient has a past medical history of asthma and cocaine use, which are not relevant to the symptoms described. The patient's medications include albuterol and ibuprofen, which are commonly used for asthma and pain relief, respectively, and do not suggest a specific condition. The patient's initial vital signs and physical examination findings are consistent with hypovolemic shock due to trauma, and the subsequent treatment with IV fluids, norepinephrine, and blood transfusion are appropriate for this condition. However, the sudden onset of shortness of breath with wheezing and poor air movement, along with a drop in blood pressure and tachycardia, suggests a severe allergic reaction or anaphylaxis. Hemolytic anemia and ataxia are not relevant to the patient's presentation and are unlikely to be found in his history. Gum disease and poor wound healing, irregularly irregular heart rhythm, hepatitis C infection, and anti-A, B, or O antibodies in the serum are also not consistent with the patient's presentation and are less likely to be found in his history.",
"An academic obstetrician is conducting a retrospective cohort study that evaluates the risk of placenta accreta at all statewide medical centers. Per chart review he finds that a prior cesarian birth is associated with a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta. The relative risk associated with this finding is 1.23. The associated p-value is 0.03. Which of the following statements is the best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study?
Options:
(A): The 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis.
(B): The chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis is 3%.
(C): The p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarian birth, assuming the alternative hypothesis is true.
(D): There is a 23% probability of seeing the reported risk by chance alone.
(E): The p-value represents the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false.
",The 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis.,Correct,"The correct choice is (A): The 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the obstetrician conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the risk of placenta accreta in women with a prior cesarean birth. The study found that there is a statistically significant increased risk of placenta accreta associated with a prior cesarean birth, with a relative risk of 1.23 and a p-value of 0.03.

The best interpretation of the reported association in the context of the study is that the 99% confidence interval includes the null hypothesis. This means that there is a 99% chance that the true relative risk falls within the confidence interval, and the null hypothesis (no association between prior cesarean birth and placenta accreta) cannot be rejected.

The p-value represents the likelihood of seeing an increased risk of placenta accreta in women with prior cesarean birth, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the p-value is 0.03, which is below the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the association is statistically significant. However, it does not represent the likelihood that the alternative hypothesis is false.

There is no information provided about the chance of bias in favor of the alternative hypothesis or the probability of seeing the reported risk by chance alone. Therefore, options (B) and (D) are not the best interpretations of the reported association.",
"A 23-year-old man presents to his primary care physician after bleeding from his gums while brushing his teeth for the past week. Although he has had gum bleeding in the past, it has never been this severe. He has no family history available as he was adopted. He does not have any significant past medical history. His physical exam is within normal limits. Screening lab work is ordered with the following values:
Platelet count 330,000/mm3
Bleeding time 6 mins
Prothrombin time 12 sec
Activated partial thromboplastin time 42 sec
Factor VIII activity decreased
Ristocetin cofactor assay decreased
He is subsequently referred to a hematologist for further work-up and treatment. Which of the following aspects of coagulation would most likely be affected?
Options:
(A): Factor IX
(B): Gp Ib
(C): Factor XI
(D): Vitamin K
(E): Antithrombin III
",Gp Ib,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Gp Ib.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the patient has a decreased factor VIII activity and a decreased ristocetin cofactor assay. These findings suggest a defect in platelet function rather than a coagulation factor deficiency. The Gp Ib receptor is a platelet surface receptor that binds von Willebrand factor (VWF) and plays a crucial role in platelet adhesion to the injured vessel wall. Deficiency or dysfunction of Gp Ib can lead to impaired platelet adhesion and subsequent bleeding. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of gum bleeding and the abnormal lab findings. Therefore, the most likely aspect of coagulation affected in this patient is Gp Ib.",
"A 51-year-old Caucasian woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She had a Colles' fracture 2 years ago. The rest of her past medical history is unremarkable. She has a sedentary lifestyle. She has been smoking 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years. She drinks alcohol moderately. Her mother had a fracture of the wrist when she was in her late 60s. The physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) shows a T-score of -3.2 standard deviations (SDs) in the hip. The patient is educated regarding her risk of falls. Exercise regimen and smoking cessation assistance are provided. Appropriate diet is indicated, as well as supplements with calcium and vitamin D. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Alendronate
(B): Calcitonin
(C): Estrogen
(D): Tamoxifen
(E): No pharmacotherapy at this time
",Alendronate,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Alendronate.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's age, history of Colles' fracture, sedentary lifestyle, smoking history, and low T-score on DEXA scan, she meets the criteria for pharmacotherapy for osteoporosis. Alendronate is a bisphosphonate that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for osteoporosis. It works by inhibiting bone resorption and reducing the risk of fractures. In this patient, alendronate would be the most appropriate next step in pharmacotherapy to help improve her bone density and reduce her risk of future fractures.",
"A 33-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 26 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department because of frequent contractions. The contractions last 40 seconds, occur every 2 minutes, and are increasing in intensity. She has a history of recurrent painful ulcers on her vulva, but she currently does not have them. Her first child was delivered by lower segment transverse cesarean section because of a non-reassuring fetal heart rate. Her current medications include acyclovir, folic acid, and a multivitamin. Her temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), heart rate is 88/min, and blood pressure is 126/76 mm Hg. Contractions are felt on the abdomen. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm, 70% effaced, and the station of the head is -2. A fetal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Allow vaginal delivery
(B): Initiate misoprostol therapy
(C): Initiate nifedipine therapy
(D): Perform cesarean delivery
(E): Perform dilation and evacuation
",Allow vaginal delivery,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Allow vaginal delivery.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is at 26 weeks' gestation and is experiencing frequent contractions that are increasing in intensity. The cervix is dilated to 5 cm and 70% effaced, indicating that she is in active labor. The station of the head is -2, which means that the baby's head is still relatively high in the pelvis. 

Given that the patient is in active labor and there are no indications for cesarean delivery, such as fetal distress or other complications, the most appropriate next step in management would be to allow vaginal delivery. This is the preferred mode of delivery for a patient in active labor without any contraindications. 

Initiating misoprostol therapy (B) or nifedipine therapy (C) would not be appropriate in this case, as these medications are typically used for cervical ripening or tocolysis in preterm labor. The patient is already in active labor and does not require cervical ripening or tocolysis at this point. 

Performing a cesarean delivery (D) or dilation and evacuation (E) would not be indicated in this case, as there are no indications for these procedures. The patient is in active labor and a vaginal delivery is the most appropriate course of action.",
"A 55-year-old man presents with complaints of exertional dyspnea and dry cough. He reports using extra pillows at night to sleep and two nighttime awakenings to catch his breath in the last month. The patient lives in a homeless shelter and has not seen a doctor in the last 20 years. He has been drinking 5-8 drinks of alcohol per day for the last 20 years. Family history is non-significant, and the patient does not take any medications. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.9°F), blood pressure is 135/115 mm Hg, pulse is 85/min, and respiratory rate is 24/min. Physical examination reveals 2+ bilateral pitting edema. Chest auscultation reveals bibasilar crackles. Which of the following is associated with this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
(B): Decreased vascular smooth muscle tone
(C): Decreased extracellular fluid (ECF) volume
(D): Increased renal blood flow
(E): Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption
",Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF), which is characterized by fluid overload and impaired cardiac function. The increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption is associated with CHF.

In CHF, the heart's pumping ability is compromised, leading to decreased cardiac output. This results in decreased renal perfusion and activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The activation of RAAS leads to increased secretion of aldosterone, which acts on the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts of the kidneys to increase sodium reabsorption. This increased sodium reabsorption leads to increased water reabsorption, contributing to fluid overload and edema seen in CHF.

Therefore, increased renal tubular sodium reabsorption is associated with this patient's condition of congestive heart failure.",
"A 22-year-old man presents to the medical clinic after getting bit in the hand by a stray dog 2 days ago. The patient has no past medical history and takes no prescription medications. He does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. The patient’s vitals are currently within normal limits. On examination, the physician notices 2 clean puncture wounds with localized cellulitis. Capillary refill is 2 seconds. Sensorimotor evaluation of the hand is without deficits. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment choice for this patient?
Options:
(A): Amoxicillin
(B): Amoxicillin-clavulanate
(C): Clindamycin
(D): Doxycycline
(E): Azithromycin
",Amoxicillin-clavulanate,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Amoxicillin-clavulanate.

Explanation:
In the case of an infected bite wound, the most appropriate treatment choice is Amoxicillin-clavulanate. Bite wounds are prone to infection due to the introduction of bacteria from the animal's mouth. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that covers the most common organisms involved in bite wound infections, including Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Pasteurella, and Eikenella. It is effective against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. 

Other options:
(A) Amoxicillin: While amoxicillin alone may provide some coverage, it does not cover the broader range of organisms that can be involved in bite wound infections. Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred choice in this case.
(C) Clindamycin: Clindamycin is an alternative option for patients who are allergic to penicillin. However, in this case, the patient has no known allergies and Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred choice.
(D) Doxycycline: Doxycycline is not the first-line treatment for infected bite wounds. It may be used in certain situations, such as if the patient is allergic to penicillin, but Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred choice.
(E) Azithromycin: Azithromycin is not the first-line treatment for infected bite wounds. It may be used in certain situations, such as if the patient is allergic to penicillin, but Amoxicillin-clavulanate is the preferred choice.",
"A 3-year-old refugee with increasing pitting edema and abdominal swelling over the past 2 months is brought to the physician. Her family has been displaced several times over the last few years. Nutrition and housing were frequently inadequate. At the physician’s clinic, the boy appears irritated and drowsy. He is difficult to arouse. Physical examination shows pitting edema over the ankles and feet and around his eyes. Abdominal examination is positive for ascites and hepatomegaly. Oral examination shows several missing teeth. Which of the following best explains these findings?
Options:
(A): Kwashiorkor
(B): Marasmus
(C): Beriberi
(D): Rickets
(E): Scurvy
",Kwashiorkor,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Kwashiorkor.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of pitting edema over the ankles and feet, around the eyes, ascites, hepatomegaly, and oral examination findings of missing teeth are consistent with the diagnosis of Kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor is a form of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) that occurs due to inadequate intake of protein and calories. It is commonly seen in resource-limited countries and in populations with poor nutrition and inadequate housing, such as refugees.

Kwashiorkor is characterized by generalized edema, which is seen as ascites and puffiness of the face, hands, and legs. The edema starts in the most dependent areas of the body and progresses cephalad as it worsens. In addition to edema, other physical examination findings may include a head that appears large relative to the body, emaciated and weak appearance, irritability, thin and dry skin, shrunken arms and thighs with redundant skin folds, and thin, sparse hair that is easily plucked.

The missing teeth seen in the oral examination are a result of poor nutrition and inadequate intake of essential nutrients, including protein and vitamins. Kwashiorkor is associated with deficiencies in multiple nutrients, including protein, calories, and essential vitamins and minerals.

Marasmus, another form of SAM, is characterized by severe wasting and loss of muscle mass and subcutaneous fat. It typically presents with severe weight loss, emaciation, and a ""skin and bones"" appearance. Marasmus is not associated with edema or hepatomegaly, which are key features of Kwashiorkor.

Beriberi is a condition caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency and is characterized by neurological symptoms such as peripheral neuropathy, cardiovascular symptoms, and edema. However, the clinical presentation described in the question is not consistent with beriberi.

Rickets is a condition caused by vitamin D deficiency and is characterized by impaired bone growth and development, leading to skeletal deformities. The clinical presentation described in the question is not consistent with rickets.

Scurvy is a condition caused by vitamin C deficiency and is characterized by weakness, fatigue, gum disease, and poor wound healing. The clinical presentation described in the question is not consistent with scurvy.",
"A 2-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his parents for a routine visit. Since his 18-month visit, the parents have become concerned that his speech does not seem to be developing appropriately. The parents report that the patient’s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient’s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?
Options:
(A): Autosomal dominant
(B): Autosomal recessive
(C): Noninherited somatic mutation
(D): X-linked dominant
(E): X-linked recessive
",X-linked dominant,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) X-linked dominant.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with a trinucleotide repeat disorder, along with the presence of a long and narrow face, suggests the diagnosis of fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. This disorder is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern, which means that a single copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause the disorder. In this case, the patient's mother is likely a carrier of the mutated gene and has a 50% chance of passing it on to her children. Since the patient is a male and only has one X chromosome, he is more severely affected by the disorder compared to females who have two X chromosomes. This is consistent with the patient's delayed speech development and hyperactivity.",
"A 23-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a change in his personality. The mother reports that over the past 7 months her son has become increasingly withdrawn; he has not answered any phone calls or visited his family and friends. He had always been a quiet boy, who needed some time on his own, but he used to meet with friends at least once a week. The patient says that he cannot leave the house because aliens are watching him and “stealing his thoughts”. He does not drink alcohol. He used to smoke marijuana occasionally but quit 1 year ago. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. On mental status examination, it is impossible to follow the patient's sequence of thoughts. He is anxious and has a flat affect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Brief psychotic disorder
(B): Delusional disorder
(C): Mood disorder with psychotic features
(D): Schizoid personality disorder
(E): Schizophrenia
",Schizophrenia,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Schizophrenia.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by a combination of psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, as well as negative symptoms, such as social withdrawal and flat affect. In this case, the patient's withdrawal from social activities, belief in aliens watching him and stealing his thoughts, and difficulty following his thoughts are all indicative of schizophrenia.

Brief psychotic disorder (A) is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic symptoms that last for a brief period of time, typically less than 1 month. The patient's symptoms have been present for 7 months, making this diagnosis less likely.

Delusional disorder (B) is characterized by the presence of non-bizarre delusions that persist for at least 1 month. However, the patient's symptoms also include hallucinations and negative symptoms, which are not consistent with delusional disorder.

Mood disorder with psychotic features (C) refers to a mood disorder, such as major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, that is accompanied by psychotic symptoms. The patient does not exhibit symptoms of a mood disorder, making this diagnosis less likely.

Schizoid personality disorder (D) is a personality disorder characterized by a lack of interest in social relationships and a preference for solitary activities. While the patient does exhibit social withdrawal, his symptoms are more indicative of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is schizophrenia.",
"A 37-year-old woman presents to the clinic with pain and swelling of her legs. She states that she first noticed the swelling 6 weeks ago. Initially, the swelling was minimal, but now she is finding it difficult to walk and she can’t fit into any of her shoes. Her medical history is significant for systemic lupus erythematosus. She takes ibuprofen and hydroxychloroquine. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 153/86 mmHg, and pulse is 88 beats/min. Pitting edema to bilateral knees is noted on physical examination. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria. The patient is started on an immunosuppressant. Two days later the patient returns to clinic complaining of blood in her urine. A urinalysis reveals moderate erythrocytes but is negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, or crystals. Diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization is seen on cystoscopy. Which of the following could have prevented the patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Ifosfamide
(B): Mesna
(C): Methotrexate
(D): Nitrofurantoin
(E): Prednisone
",Mesna,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Mesna.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with lupus nephritis, which is a common complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lupus nephritis is characterized by inflammation of the kidneys, leading to proteinuria, hematuria, and renal dysfunction. In this case, the patient developed blood in her urine (hematuria) after starting an immunosuppressant medication.

Mesna is a medication that is commonly used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis, which is a potential side effect of certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as ifosfamide. Hemorrhagic cystitis is characterized by inflammation and bleeding of the bladder mucosa. The patient's cystoscopy findings of diffuse oozing of the bladder mucosa with neovascularization are consistent with hemorrhagic cystitis.

In this case, the patient's immunosuppressant medication likely triggered the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. If the patient had been given mesna along with the immunosuppressant, it could have prevented the development of hemorrhagic cystitis and the subsequent blood in the urine.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Mesna.",
"A 38-year-old woman presents to the office for a routine examination. She has no complaints and offers very little information voluntarily. She answers each question with soft, short sentences and avoids eye contact. She appears timid, anxious and admits that this is one of the very few times she has left the house in the last several years. Medical history is significant for essential hypertension. She takes hydrochlorothiazide and a daily vitamin. She has worked from home as a web graphic designer for 20 years. Questions about her social life reveal that she is very shy with few friends, and she often makes excuses to avoid parties and social gatherings. Despite this, she expresses a strong desire to be in a relationship. Today, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 95/min, respiratory rate is 18/min, and temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical examination, her heart has a regular rhythm and her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Which of the following is most consistent with her behavior?
Options:
(A): Body dysmorphic disorder
(B): Schizoid personality disorder
(C): Avoidant personality disorder
(D): Antisocial personality disorder
(E): Agoraphobia
",Avoidant personality disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Avoidant personality disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's behavior is most consistent with avoidant personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. Individuals with this disorder often avoid social interactions and have a limited social network. They may have a strong desire for relationships but are fearful of rejection and criticism, leading them to avoid social gatherings and make excuses to avoid them. The patient's timid and anxious behavior, avoidance of eye contact, and reluctance to provide information voluntarily are all consistent with avoidant personality disorder. Additionally, her desire to be in a relationship despite her social difficulties is also characteristic of this disorder.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the emergency room by his mother after she found him somnolent at home next to multiple open pill bottles. The boy had seemingly opened several different pill bottles that were in a cabinet in his parent’s bathroom. The mother has brought the empty bottles to the emergency room, and they include aspirin, metoprolol, acetaminophen, levothyroxine, and lorazepam. The boy has no past medical history and takes no medications. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 110/65 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 28/min. On exam, the boy is lethargic but responsive. He appears to be grasping at his ears and swaying from side-to-side when attempting to ambulate. He vomited once in the emergency room. Which of the following arterial blood gas readings is most likely to be found in this patient?
Options:
(A): pH 7.29, PCO2 47 mmHg, and HCO3- 22 mEq/L
(B): pH 7.35, PCO2 29 mmHg, and HCO3- 15 mEq/L
(C): pH 7.36, PCO2 22 mmHg, and HCO3- 16 mEq/L
(D): pH 7.47, PCO2 41 mmHg, and HCO3- 29 mEq/L
(E): pH 7.48, PCO2 24 mmHg, and HCO3- 25 mEq/L
","pH 7.36, PCO2 22 mmHg, and HCO3- 16 mEq/L",Correct,"The correct choice is (C): pH 7.36, PCO2 22 mmHg, and HCO3- 16 mEq/L.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this patient, including somnolence, grasping at ears, swaying from side-to-side, and vomiting, is consistent with salicylate toxicity, which is commonly seen with aspirin overdose. Salicylates are a class of drugs that include aspirin and can cause a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. 

In salicylate toxicity, the initial respiratory alkalosis is caused by direct stimulation of the respiratory centers in the medulla, leading to hyperventilation and a decrease in PCO2. This is reflected in the arterial blood gas by a low PCO2 value. The metabolic acidosis occurs due to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, leading to increased production of lactic acid and ketoacids. This results in a decrease in bicarbonate (HCO3-) levels. 

Option (C) is the most likely arterial blood gas reading in this patient because it shows a pH within the normal range (7.36), a low PCO2 value (22 mmHg), and a decreased bicarbonate level (16 mEq/L), consistent with a mixed respiratory alkalosis and metabolic acidosis seen in salicylate toxicity. 

Option (A) has a low pH (7.29), which would indicate acidemia, but the PCO2 value (47 mmHg) is too high for a respiratory alkalosis. The bicarbonate level (22 mEq/L) is also within the normal range, which is not consistent with a metabolic acidosis. 

Option (B) has a normal pH (7.35), a low PCO2 value (29 mmHg), and a decreased bicarbonate level (15 mEq/L), which could be seen in a respiratory alkalosis. However, the bicarbonate level is too low for a metabolic acidosis seen in salicylate toxicity. 

Option (D) has a high pH (7.47), which would indicate alkalemia, but the PCO2 value (41 mmHg) is too high for a respiratory alkalosis. The bicarbonate level (29 mEq/L) is also within the normal range, which is not consistent with a metabolic acidosis. 

Option (E) has a high pH (7.48), which would indicate alkalemia, and a low PCO2 value (24 mmHg), which could be seen in a respiratory alkalosis. However, the bicarbonate level (25 mEq/L) is within the normal range, which is not consistent with a metabolic acidosis seen in salicylate toxicity.",
"A 38-year-old man presents with progressive tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion. Past medical history is significant for peptic ulcer disease diagnosed 2 years ago for which he is not compliant with his medications. He reports a 10-pack-year smoking history and occasionally alcohol use. His vital signs include: temperature 37.1°C (98.7°F), blood pressure 142/91 mm Hg, pulse 98/min. Physical examination is unremarkable. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL
Hematocrit 29.1%
Red cell count 3.7 million/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 71 μm3
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 21.3 pg/cell
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) 28.4 Hb/cell
Reticulocyte count 0.2 %
Red cell distribution width (RDW) 17.8 (ref: 11.5–14.5%)
White blood cell count 8100/mm3
Platelet count 420,000/mm3
Iron studies show:
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) 620 μg/dL
Transferrin saturation 9%
Which of the following findings would most likely be found on a bone marrow biopsy in this patient?
Options:
(A): Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration
(B): ↑ megakaryocytes
(C): ↓ hemosiderin stores
(D): Ringed sideroblasts
(E): Myeloblasts with immature precursors
",↓ hemosiderin stores,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): ↓ hemosiderin stores.

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia is characterized by low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red cell count, as well as microcytic (low MCV) and hypochromic (low MCHC) red blood cells. The low reticulocyte count indicates decreased production of red blood cells.

In iron deficiency anemia, there is a decrease in iron stores in the body. Hemosiderin is an intracellular form of iron storage, and its decrease is a characteristic finding in iron deficiency anemia. A bone marrow biopsy in this patient would show decreased hemosiderin stores.

Option (A): Hypocellularity with fatty infiltration is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Hypocellularity refers to a decrease in the number of cells in the bone marrow, which is not typically seen in iron deficiency anemia. Fatty infiltration is associated with conditions such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.

Option (B): ↑ megakaryocytes is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Increased megakaryocytes are seen in conditions such as essential thrombocythemia or myeloproliferative neoplasms, which are not related to iron deficiency anemia.

Option (D): Ringed sideroblasts are not typically seen in iron deficiency anemia. Ringed sideroblasts are seen in conditions such as sideroblastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.

Option (E): Myeloblasts with immature precursors are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Myeloblasts are immature cells of the myeloid lineage and their presence in the bone marrow is indicative of a myeloid neoplasm, such as acute myeloid leukemia. This is not related to iron deficiency anemia.",
"A 27-year-old G3P1010 makes an appointment with her gynecologist for evaluation of profuse bleeding, which began two days ago. She is 13 weeks pregnant based on the date of her last menstrual period. She is dizzy and weak, and is unable to move around the house and perform her daily tasks. Initially, she had only light spotting, but later on in the day the bleeding increased. Thus far, she has used six sanitary pads. The blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, the temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), the pulse is 125/min, and the respiratory rate is 14/min. A saline infusion is started, and blood and urine specimens are sent for analysis. On pelvic examination, the vagina contains blood and the cervical os is open. She also complains of cervical motion and adnexal tenderness on examination. An ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac low in the uterine cavity. No fetal movement or cardiac activity are observed. She is advised to rest for a couple of hours, after which the scan is repeated. Slight downward migration of the gestational sac is observed with no change in the fetal status. Which of the following is the next step in management?
Options:
(A): Antibiotics
(B): Bed rest and analgesics
(C): Magnesium sulfate
(D): Methotrexate
(E): Dilation and curettage
",Dilation and curettage,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Dilation and curettage.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, this patient is experiencing a threatened miscarriage or an incomplete miscarriage. The profuse bleeding, open cervical os, and lack of fetal movement or cardiac activity on ultrasound suggest that the pregnancy is not viable. The slight downward migration of the gestational sac on repeat ultrasound indicates that the miscarriage is progressing. 

Dilation and curettage (D&C) is the next step in management for this patient. D&C involves dilating the cervix and removing the contents of the uterus, including the gestational sac and any remaining products of conception. This procedure is performed to prevent further bleeding, infection, and to ensure complete removal of the pregnancy tissue. It is the most appropriate option in this case because the patient is experiencing significant bleeding, is symptomatic with dizziness and weakness, and the pregnancy is not viable.

Antibiotics (A) would not be the next step in management because the patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a miscarriage, not an infection. Antibiotics would not address the underlying issue.

Bed rest and analgesics (B) may be recommended for patients with threatened miscarriage, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and findings suggest that the miscarriage is progressing. Bed rest and analgesics alone would not be sufficient to manage the significant bleeding and ensure complete removal of the pregnancy tissue.

Magnesium sulfate (C) is not indicated in this case. Magnesium sulfate is typically used for the management of preeclampsia and eclampsia, which are not present in this patient.

Methotrexate (D) is a medication used for medical management of ectopic pregnancies, not for the management of miscarriages. In this case, the ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestational sac, ruling out an ectopic pregnancy.",
"An otherwise healthy 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of pain and swelling of her right knee joint and left wrist. She went camping with her new boyfriend 3 weeks ago but does not recall any tick bites. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F). Examination of the right knee shows swelling, warmth, and tenderness on passive movement. There is a tender pustule on the sole of the left foot. Arthrocentesis of the right knee joint yields 8 mL of cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 45,000/mm3 (90% segmented neutrophils with intracellular organisms). Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Autoantibody production
(B): Intravenous drug use
(C): Sexually transmitted infection
(D): HLA-B 27 positivity
(E): Bacterial pharyngitis
""
",Sexually transmitted infection,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Sexually transmitted infection.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling in the knee joint and wrist, along with the presence of a tender pustule on the sole of the foot, suggest a possible sexually transmitted infection (STI) called gonococcal arthritis. This condition is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can be transmitted through sexual contact. The presence of intracellular organisms in the synovial fluid obtained from the knee joint supports this diagnosis.

Autoantibody production (A) is not a risk factor for this patient's condition. Autoantibodies are antibodies that mistakenly target the body's own tissues and can lead to autoimmune diseases, but they are not associated with gonococcal arthritis.

Intravenous drug use (B) is also not a risk factor for this patient's condition. While intravenous drug use can increase the risk of certain infections, such as endocarditis or hepatitis, it is not directly related to gonococcal arthritis.

HLA-B 27 positivity (D) is a genetic marker that is associated with certain autoimmune conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis, but it is not a risk factor for gonococcal arthritis.

Bacterial pharyngitis (E) is not a risk factor for this patient's condition. Bacterial pharyngitis, or strep throat, is caused by a different bacterium (Group A Streptococcus) and is not associated with gonococcal arthritis.

Therefore, the strongest risk factor for this patient's condition is a sexually transmitted infection (C).",
"A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for management of his gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). He is currently on cimetidine for his condition and reports that his GERD initially improved. However, following his recent move to Michigan, he is experiencing more frequent episodes of chest pain (4-5 times a week). The pain is described as burning in quality and is concentrated around his epigastric region following food ingestion. It does not radiate anywhere and is alleviated when he takes antacids. A physical examination demonstrates a healthy male with unremarkable findings. He is subsequently prescribed a new medication for control of his symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism of action of this new medication?
Options:
(A): Irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase enzyme
(B): Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells
(C): Irreversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors
(D): Reversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells
(E): Reversible inhibition of histamine H2 receptors
",Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.

Explanation:
The patient is experiencing symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is characterized by the reflux of gastric acid into the esophagus. The symptoms of burning chest pain concentrated around the epigastric region following food ingestion are consistent with GERD.

The patient is currently on cimetidine, which is an H2 receptor antagonist. H2 receptor antagonists work by reversibly inhibiting histamine H2 receptors, reducing gastric acid secretion. However, the patient's symptoms have worsened despite being on cimetidine.

The new medication prescribed for the patient is most likely a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), which irreversibly inhibits H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells. This enzyme is responsible for the final step in gastric acid secretion, and irreversible inhibition of this enzyme leads to a significant reduction in gastric acid production.

PPIs are more potent than H2 receptor antagonists and are the preferred treatment for severe GERD symptoms or cases of erosive or ulcerative esophagitis. They provide more effective and long-lasting acid suppression compared to H2 receptor antagonists.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism of action of the new medication prescribed for the patient is irreversible inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase at parietal cells.",
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for evaluation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes. He has no history of major medical illness. He had a sore throat and cough 2 weeks ago that resolved spontaneously. Physical examination shows moderate periorbital edema and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities bilaterally. A kidney biopsy specimen shows effacement of the podocytes on electron microscopy. Which of the following is most likely to be found on urinalysis?
Options:
(A): Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins
(B): Red blood cell casts and acanthocytes
(C): Fatty casts and albumin
(D): White blood cell casts and eosinophils
(E): Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells
",Fatty casts and albumin,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Fatty casts and albumin.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of progressively worsening swelling around the eyes, along with periorbital edema and lower extremity edema, suggests nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier, leading to proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. The effacement of the podocytes on kidney biopsy is a characteristic finding in minimal change disease, which is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children.

On urinalysis, the presence of fatty casts and albumin is most likely. Fatty casts are formed when lipids accumulate within the tubules and are seen in nephrotic syndrome. Albuminuria is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome, as the increased permeability of the glomerular filtration barrier allows albumin to be filtered into the urine.

The other options are less likely to be found in this case:
(A) Hyaline casts and immunoglobulins: Hyaline casts are non-specific and can be seen in various conditions. Immunoglobulins are not typically found in the urine in nephrotic syndrome.
(B) Red blood cell casts and acanthocytes: Red blood cell casts are seen in glomerulonephritis, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Acanthocytes are seen in certain types of hemolytic anemia and are not specific to nephrotic syndrome.
(D) White blood cell casts and eosinophils: White blood cell casts are seen in pyelonephritis or interstitial nephritis, which are not the most likely diagnoses in this case. Eosinophils are associated with allergic interstitial nephritis, which is also less likely.
(E) Granular casts and tubular epithelial cells: Granular casts can be seen in acute tubular necrosis, but this is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Tubular epithelial cells can be seen in various renal diseases, but they are not specific to nephrotic syndrome.",
"Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
Options:
(A): Measurement bias
(B): Recall bias
(C): Lead-time bias
(D): Selection bias
(E): Length-time bias
",Measurement bias,Incorrect,"The correct answer is (C): Lead-time bias.

Explanation: Lead-time bias occurs when an intervention or test appears to improve outcomes simply because it detects the condition earlier, without actually changing the natural history or prognosis of the condition. In this scenario, if the conclusion stated that initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure and no significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis, it would exemplify lead-time bias.

In this study, the researchers compared the outcomes of patients who underwent initial diagnostic ultrasonography (either point-of-care or radiology) or abdominal non-contrast CT for suspected nephrolithiasis. The conclusion states that initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations. However, if the lower radiation exposure and similar outcomes were solely due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis with ultrasonography, it would be an example of lead-time bias.

Lead-time bias can occur when an intervention or test detects a condition earlier, leading to the appearance of improved outcomes, but without actually changing the course or prognosis of the condition. In this case, if ultrasonography detected nephrolithiasis earlier than CT, it could lead to earlier management and treatment, but it would not necessarily change the natural history or prognosis of the condition. Therefore, the conclusion that there were no significant differences in outcomes between ultrasonography and CT could be biased by lead-time bias.",
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of intermittent chest pain and palpitations. She also complains of dyspnea on exertion and has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss in the past 2 months despite normal appetite. She has no history of serious medical illness. Cardiac examination shows an irregularly irregular rhythm and a grade 3/6, low pitched, rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex. Diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales are present in the lung bases. A transthoracic echocardiogram shows a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium. A biopsy of the mass is likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Nonencapsulated groups of well-differentiated skeletal muscle cells
(B): Clusters of bland cells without mitotic activity
(C): Mixture of cells from different germinal layers
(D): Encapsulated cluster of mature fat cells
(E): Nests of atypical melanocytes
",Nests of atypical melanocytes,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Nests of atypical melanocytes.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is most likely experiencing symptoms of cardiac myxoma, which is the most common primary cardiac tumor in adults. Cardiac myxomas are typically located in the left atrium and can cause symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss.

The irregularly irregular rhythm and mid-diastolic murmur heard best over the apex are consistent with atrial fibrillation and a tumor-related mitral valve obstruction, respectively. The diffuse wheezing and bilateral rales suggest pulmonary edema, which can occur due to impaired left ventricular function.

A transthoracic echocardiogram showing a left-ventricular ejection fraction of 40% and a mass in the left atrium further supports the diagnosis of a cardiac myxoma.

Histologically, cardiac myxomas are composed of a mixture of cells from different germinal layers, including nests of atypical melanocytes. These melanocytes are thought to be derived from neural crest cells, which can differentiate into various cell types, including melanocytes.

Therefore, a biopsy of the mass in the left atrium is likely to show nests of atypical melanocytes, making option (E) the correct answer.",
"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent painful retrosternal dullness for 4 weeks. The pain is recurrent and occurs when she exerts herself or when she is outside during cold weather. She also experiences shortness of breath and palpitations during these episodes. The symptoms resolve spontaneously when she stops or sits down for a while. Over the past few days, the episodes have increased in frequency. She has hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and osteoarthritis. Her left leg was amputated below the knee after a motorcycle accident 25 years ago. She is currently waiting for a new prosthesis and walks with crutches. Current medications include captopril, glyburide, and ibuprofen. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Her pulse is 88/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 144/90 mm Hg. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the chest shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm without any signs of ischemia. Serum cardiac markers are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress
(B): Upper endoscopy
(C): Coronary angiography
(D): Echocardiography at rest
(E): Repeat ECG under treadmill stress
",Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of intermittent retrosternal dullness, which worsen with exertion and cold weather, along with associated shortness of breath and palpitations, are suggestive of angina pectoris. Angina pectoris is caused by myocardial ischemia, which occurs when there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand. In this patient, the symptoms are likely due to coronary artery disease (CAD), given her risk factors of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and age.

The initial evaluation for suspected CAD typically includes an ECG and cardiac biomarkers, which have already been done and are within normal limits in this patient. However, a normal resting ECG does not exclude CAD, especially in patients with symptoms suggestive of angina. Therefore, further testing is warranted.

The most appropriate next step in diagnosis is a myocardial perfusion scan under pharmacological stress. This test involves the injection of a radioactive tracer, such as technetium-99m, followed by imaging of the heart using a gamma camera. Pharmacological stress is induced using a vasodilator, such as adenosine or dipyridamole, in patients who are unable to exercise adequately due to physical limitations, such as the patient in this case who has an amputated leg and walks with crutches. The myocardial perfusion scan can detect areas of myocardial ischemia or infarction by assessing regional blood flow to the heart. If there is a perfusion defect, it suggests the presence of significant CAD.

Upper endoscopy (B) is not indicated in this patient as her symptoms are not suggestive of gastrointestinal pathology.

Coronary angiography (C) is an invasive procedure and is typically reserved for patients with high-risk features or those who are candidates for revascularization. It is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation.

Echocardiography at rest (D) can provide information about cardiac structure and function but is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation for suspected CAD.

Repeat ECG under treadmill stress (E) is an alternative stress test for patients who are able to exercise adequately. However, in this patient with physical limitations, a pharmacological stress test is more appropriate.

Magnetic resonance angiography (F) is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation for suspected CAD. It may be used in certain cases to assess coronary artery anatomy, but it is not the initial test of choice.",
"A 24-year-old primigravida presents to her physician at 20 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment 2 weeks ago, and was treated with amoxicillin. She has no concurrent diseases and no complaints. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 82/min, respiratory rate 11/min, and temperature 36.6℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals no abnormalities. On gynecologic examination, the cervix is soft and non-tender with no discharge from the external os. The uterus is enlarged to the umbilicus and the fetal heart rate is normal. Which of the following statements is the most accurate with respect to the presented case?
Options:
(A): This patient does not require further urinary tests unless she becomes symptomatic.
(B): Urinalysis should be performed on each subsequent antenatal visit to screen for possible recurrence of bacteriuria.
(C): Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.
(D): Perform urine dipstick assay for leukocyte esterase.
(E): Urinalysis should be performed to check for leukocytes, blood, and bacteria; if positive, perform a urine culture.
",Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Urine culture should be performed in this patient again.

Explanation:
According to the provided information, the patient was diagnosed with asymptomatic bacteriuria at her last appointment and was treated with amoxicillin. However, it is important to note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women includes antibiotic therapy tailored to culture results. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a urine culture again to ensure that the bacteriuria has been cleared and to guide further management if needed. Routine follow-up urine cultures are not recommended for all pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria, but in this case, since the patient was previously diagnosed and treated, it is important to confirm clearance of the infection.",
"A 36-year-old G3P2 woman with no significant past medical history delivers a 3.7 kg (8 lb, 3 oz) baby boy following an uncomplicated pregnancy. On physical examination in the delivery room, the pediatrician notes that the baby has upslanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, a flat facial profile, small ears, a single palmar crease, and hypotonia. When discussing the diagnosis with the parents, which of the following is this baby at an increased risk for having?
Options:
(A): Tetralogy of Fallot
(B): Omphalocele
(C): Congenital cataracts
(D): Cleft lip
(E): Macroorchidism
",Omphalocele,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Omphalocele.

Explanation:
The physical examination findings described in the question stem are consistent with the features of Down syndrome, also known as trisomy 21. Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21. 

One of the common associated findings in Down syndrome is omphalocele, which is the protrusion of abdominal contents through the umbilical ring. This occurs due to a defect in the development of the abdominal wall. Omphalocele is seen in approximately 10-20% of infants with Down syndrome.

The other options listed are not typically associated with Down syndrome. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by four specific abnormalities in the heart's structure. Congenital cataracts are opacities in the lens of the eye that are present at birth. Cleft lip is a facial malformation that occurs when the lip does not fuse properly during fetal development. Macroorchidism refers to abnormally large testicles, which is not a characteristic finding in Down syndrome.",
"A 52-year-old woman presents with a complaint of headache for the past 10 days. Her headache is diffuse, dull in character, moderate in intensity, and is worse in the morning. It is not associated with fever and sensitivity to light or sound. She experiences occasional nausea but no vomiting. She did not have similar headaches in the past. Her blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg; pulse, 60/min, and body mass index is 33.5 kg/m2. The neurological examination reveals normal extraocular movements. Mild bilateral papilledema is present. A magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals a solitary lesion in the left temporal region with predominant hemorrhage. Refer to the image below of the MRI of the brain. Which of the following types of cancer has the highest tendency to cause this brain lesion?
Options:
(A): Breast cancer
(B): Lung cancer
(C): Melanoma
(D): Multiple myeloma
(E): Thyroid cancer
",Melanoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Melanoma.

Explanation:
The presentation of a solitary brain lesion with hemorrhage, along with the presence of mild bilateral papilledema, suggests the possibility of a brain metastasis. Among the given options, melanoma has the highest tendency to metastasize to the brain. Melanoma is known for its high metastatic potential, and the brain is a common site of metastasis in advanced cases. In fact, melanoma is the most common cause of brain metastases overall. The other options, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, multiple myeloma, and thyroid cancer, can also metastasize to the brain, but melanoma has the highest propensity for brain metastasis.",
"A previously healthy 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of depressed mood and fatigue. During this time, she has had a 5-kg (11-lb) weight gain. She reports trouble concentrating at her job as a preschool teacher and has missed work several times in recent weeks due to generalized fatigue. She has smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 10 years and is actively trying to quit smoking. A drug is prescribed that will treat the patient's mood disturbance and support smoking cessation. This patient should be counseled about which of the following possible side effects of this drug?
Options:
(A): Decreased libido
(B): Hypotension
(C): Urinary retention
(D): Tachycardia
(E): QTc prolongation
",Tachycardia,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Tachycardia.

Explanation:
The patient is presenting with symptoms of depression and fatigue, which may be indicative of a mood disturbance. Additionally, she has gained weight and is actively trying to quit smoking. Based on this information, it is likely that the drug prescribed for her is an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid.

Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are commonly used to treat depression and can also help with smoking cessation. One of the possible side effects of SSRIs is tachycardia, which is an increased heart rate. This side effect is more commonly seen with certain SSRIs, such as fluoxetine and sertraline.

Tachycardia can occur due to the effects of SSRIs on the autonomic nervous system, specifically by increasing sympathetic activity. It is important to counsel the patient about this potential side effect so that she is aware of it and can report any significant changes in her heart rate to her physician.

The other options listed are not commonly associated with the use of SSRIs. Decreased libido is a possible side effect of some antidepressants, but it is not specific to SSRIs. Hypotension, urinary retention, and QTc prolongation are not commonly associated with the use of SSRIs. Weight gain is a possible side effect of some antidepressants, but it is not specific to SSRIs and is not the most likely side effect in this case.",
"A 37-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician after returning from her honeymoon in Cancun. A few days ago, she began to notice an eruption of small red bumps that cover her torso, back, and buttocks. The patient first thought she had acne, but became worried when the rash continued to itch. The patient denies other symptoms. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is notable for red papules and pustules scattered across the trunk, abdomen, back, and buttocks, while sparing the limbs. Closer examination indicates inflammation of the hair follicles. Culture yields motile, gram-negative rods that are non-lactose fermenting and oxidase positive. What other finding is commonly observed in the culture of the most likely organism?
Options:
(A): Pink colonies
(B): Blue-green pigment
(C): Alpha-hemolysis
(D): Yellow sulfur granules
(E): Red pigment
",Blue-green pigment,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Blue-green pigment.

The most likely organism causing the patient's symptoms is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative rod that commonly causes folliculitis, especially in moist environments such as hot tubs or swimming pools. It is known to produce a blue-green pigment called pyocyanin, which gives the colonies a characteristic color.

The presence of blue-green pigment in the culture is a key characteristic of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and helps to differentiate it from other organisms. Pink colonies are typically seen in lactose-fermenting bacteria such as Escherichia coli. Alpha-hemolysis is observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes pneumonia and other respiratory infections. Yellow sulfur granules are seen in Actinomyces species, which can cause chronic skin infections. Red pigment is not typically associated with any specific organism.

Therefore, the finding of blue-green pigment in the culture supports the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most likely organism causing the patient's folliculitis.",
"A 30-year-old female presents to her primary care provider complaining of 4 days of fever, malaise, dyspnea, and productive cough and has recently developed pleuritic chest pain. Her past medical history is notable for asthma and takes albuterol as needed. She does not smoke but drinks alcohol socially. Her family history is notable for cystic fibrosis in her paternal uncle and interstitial lung disease in her paternal grandfather. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 115/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 21/min. Rales are noted in the right lower lung, and a chest radiograph demonstrates focal consolidation in the right lower lung lobe. After initiating the appropriate treatment, she agrees to take part in a study assessing the immune response to lung infections. A protein is identified in her serum that is thought to be elevated in response to her condition. An amino acid sequence at the carboxy terminus of the protein is isolated and a fluorescent marker is added to the sequence. This labeled sequence is subsequently added to a gel containing a protein isolated from the cell surface of the patient’s own neutrophils and macrophages and subsequently labeled with another fluorescent marker. The sequence binds strongly to this protein as evidenced by increased fluorescence in the gel. What process does this sequence typically undergo in immunocompetent individuals?
Options:
(A): Affinity maturation
(B): Random assortment
(C): Random nucleotide addition
(D): VDJ recombination
(E): Isotype switching
",Isotype switching,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Isotype switching.

Explanation:
Isotype switching, also known as class switching, is a process that occurs in immunocompetent individuals where the constant region of the antibody molecule changes while the variable region remains the same. This process allows B cells to produce antibodies of different isotypes (e.g., IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE) with the same antigen specificity.

In this case, the patient's serum protein is elevated in response to her lung infection. The labeled amino acid sequence from the protein binds strongly to a protein isolated from the patient's own neutrophils and macrophages. This indicates that the sequence is binding to an antibody on the cell surface. The process of isotype switching allows B cells to produce antibodies with different constant regions, which can bind to different cell surface receptors.

Isotype switching is an important mechanism in the immune response as it allows for the production of antibodies with different effector functions. Different isotypes of antibodies have different roles in the immune system, such as opsonization, neutralization, and activation of complement. By switching the constant region of the antibody, the immune system can tailor its response to different types of pathogens and infections.

Therefore, in this case, the sequence undergoing isotype switching indicates that the patient's immune system is responding to the lung infection by producing antibodies with a different constant region, allowing for a specific immune response.",
"A 27-year-old graduate student is bitten by a coral snake while he was hiking alone through the woods and dies 2 hours later from respiratory failure. His body was discovered 7 hours later by a group of campers who promptly called the police. On arrival, the police found his body to be cold and stiff. Which of the following processes is responsible for the rigidity observed?
Options:
(A): Activation of muscle contraction by neurotoxins
(B): Reduced affinity of myosin head for actin filament
(C): Effect of low temperature on muscle proteins
(D): Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling
(E): Depletion of intracellular calcium
",Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Inhibition of cross-bridge cycling.

Explanation:
The rigidity observed in the body of the graduate student is due to a process called rigor mortis. Rigor mortis occurs after death and is characterized by the stiffening of muscles. In this case, the rigidity is a result of the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling.

During muscle contraction, cross-bridge cycling occurs between the myosin heads and actin filaments. This cycling is driven by ATP, which allows the myosin heads to bind to the actin filaments, generate force, and then detach. However, after death, ATP production ceases, and the available ATP is rapidly depleted. Without ATP, the myosin heads remain bound to the actin filaments, leading to a state of sustained contraction and muscle rigidity.

Therefore, the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling is responsible for the rigidity observed in the body of the graduate student.",
"A 28-year-old G1P0 woman at 12 weeks estimated gestational age presents with malaise, joint pain, fever, and chills for the past 3 days. Physical examination reveals a mild lace-like rash and arthritis. The patient mentions her friend who is a medical student told her that her symptoms are suggestive of a parvovirus B19 infection which may adversely affect her baby. Which of the following statements regarding the effect of parvovirus B19 infection in this pregnant patient is correct?
Options:
(A): It can lead to hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia.
(B): It can cause aplastic crisis in the neonate.
(C): Physical malformations are frequently associated with congenital infection.
(D): Fetal loss occurs in more than 40% of primary infections.
(E): The neonate may be born with a typical slapped-cheek rash.
",It can lead to hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia.,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) It can lead to hydrops fetalis secondary to fetal anemia.

Explanation:
Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy can result in fetal complications including miscarriage, intrauterine fetal death, and/or non-immune hydrops fetalis. Hydrops fetalis is a condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of fluid in two or more fetal compartments, such as the skin, abdomen, and pleural space, due to severe fetal anemia. Parvovirus B19 has a particular tropism for erythroid cells, and infection can lead to suppression of red blood cell production, resulting in severe anemia in the fetus. This can ultimately lead to hydrops fetalis. Therefore, option (A) is the correct statement regarding the effect of parvovirus B19 infection in this pregnant patient.",
"A 52-year-old man with hypertension and hyperlipidemia comes to the emergency department 30 minutes after the sudden onset of substernal chest pain while sitting in a chair at home. He reports drinking 2 glasses of whiskey earlier that day, after a stressful day at work. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide and atorvastatin. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 20 years. His pulse is 102/min, and blood pressure is 135/88 mm Hg. Cardiopulmonary examination shows normal heart sounds. An ECG obtained on arrival at the emergency department shows ST-segment elevations in the anterior leads. 15 minutes later, the patient's chest pain has resolved and a repeat ECG shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient’s chest pain?
Options:
(A): Coronary artery vasospasm
(B): Coronary artery vasodilation
(C): Atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing
(D): Atherosclerotic plaque rupture
(E): Pericardial inflammation
",Coronary artery vasospasm,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Coronary artery vasospasm.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with variant (Prinzmetal) angina, which is caused by coronary artery vasospasm. The patient's sudden onset of substernal chest pain, ST-segment elevations on ECG, and resolution of symptoms and normalization of ECG findings within a short period of time are all characteristic of variant angina. Risk factors for coronary artery vasospasm include smoking, alcohol use, and emotional stress, all of which are present in this patient. The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia are also risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, but the acute and transient nature of the symptoms, as well as the absence of atherosclerotic plaques on ECG, make atherosclerotic coronary artery narrowing (choice C) and atherosclerotic plaque rupture (choice D) less likely. Pericardial inflammation (choice E) would typically present with persistent chest pain and would not explain the transient nature of the symptoms in this patient.",
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother because of a sudden loss of consciousness. He has asthma and has been hospitalized multiple times. His mother has type 2 diabetes mellitus. He is somnolent and diaphoretic. Serum studies show a glucose concentration of 22 mg/dL and a potassium concentration of 2.4 mEq/L. A dextrose infusion is administered, after which his glucose concentration normalizes and his symptoms improve. He is admitted to the hospital for further observation. Overnight, he has another episode of decreased consciousness. Serum studies taken during the episode show a glucose concentration of 19 mg/dL, an insulin concentration of 108 mIU/L (N=2.6–24.9), and a C-peptide concentration of 0.3 ng/mL (N = 0.8–3.1). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Malingering
(B): Glucagonoma
(C): Primary adrenal insufficiency
(D): Conversion disorder
(E): Factitious disorder imposed on another
""
","Factitious disorder imposed on another
""",Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Factitious disorder imposed on another.

Explanation:
In this case, the 5-year-old boy has recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia with symptoms of decreased consciousness. His glucose concentration during these episodes is significantly low (19 mg/dL) and his insulin concentration is elevated (108 mIU/L), indicating excessive insulin secretion. However, his C-peptide concentration is low (0.3 ng/mL), suggesting exogenous insulin administration rather than endogenous insulin production. This pattern is consistent with factitious disorder imposed on another, which is a condition in which a caregiver intentionally induces or fabricates symptoms in another person, often a child, to gain attention or sympathy. In this case, the mother, who has type 2 diabetes mellitus, may be administering insulin to her son to create the episodes of hypoglycemia. This diagnosis should be considered in cases of recurrent hypoglycemia with inconsistent laboratory findings and when there is suspicion of intentional harm or manipulation by a caregiver.",
"A 66-year-old woman presents with urinary incontinence, difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and dull pain in the suprapubic region. She reports that she has not urinated for the past 2 days and that the urine leakage occurs during both day and night and is not associated with physical exertion. The medical history is significant for arterial hypertension and poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus for 8 years, and depression for 3 years. She is prescribed amlodipine, valsartan, atorvastatin, metformin, and amitriptyline. Her weight is 75 kg (165 lb) and her height is 166 cm (5 ft 40 in). Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 120/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 91/min; respiratory rate, 13/min; and temperature, 36.4℃ (97.5℉). The physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness with a distended urinary bladder that is palpated in the suprapubic region. The neurological examination shows decreased Achilles reflexes bilaterally, and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation. On gynecologic examination, the cervix was normally positioned, mobile, and without any visible lesions. Bulging of the posterior vaginal wall was noted. The adnexa were not palpable. An ultrasound examination showed an overdistended urinary bladder with no structural abnormalities. Which of the following is  the next step in managing this patient?
Options:
(A): Installing a vaginal pessary
(B): Bladder catheterization
(C): Cystostomy
(D): Prescribing bethanechol
(E): Prescribing prostaglandin E2
",Bladder catheterization,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Bladder catheterization.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, she is experiencing urinary retention, which is the inability to completely empty the bladder. This is supported by her symptoms of difficulty urinating, incomplete voiding, and a distended urinary bladder on physical examination. The decreased Achilles reflexes and diminished fine touch and vibratory sensation on neurological examination suggest a neurogenic cause for her urinary retention.

Bladder catheterization is the next step in managing this patient because it will relieve the urinary retention and empty the overdistended bladder. This will provide immediate relief for the patient and prevent complications such as urinary tract infection or bladder rupture. Once the bladder is emptied, further evaluation and management can be pursued to determine the underlying cause of the urinary retention.

Installing a vaginal pessary (option A) is not indicated in this patient as it is used for the management of pelvic organ prolapse, which is not the primary concern in this case.

Cystostomy (option C) is a more invasive procedure that involves creating a surgical opening in the bladder to drain urine. It is typically reserved for cases of long-term or permanent urinary retention, and is not the initial step in managing acute urinary retention.

Prescribing bethanechol (option D) is a cholinergic medication that can stimulate bladder contractions and improve bladder emptying. However, it is not the initial step in managing acute urinary retention and should be considered after bladder catheterization if the underlying cause of the urinary retention is determined to be a hypotonic or atonic bladder.

Prescribing prostaglandin E2 (option E) is not indicated in this case as it is typically used for cervical ripening and induction of labor in obstetric settings. It is not the appropriate management for urinary retention.",
"A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with hip and back pain. The patient states that this weekend he had a barbecue. When he was lifting a heavy object he suddenly felt pain in his lower back. He describes the pain as in his buttocks but states that at times it travels down his leg. The patient states that it feels, ""electrical."" The patient has a past medical history of obesity, diabetes, depression, anxiety, diverticulosis, constipation, and a surgical repair of his anterior cruciate ligament. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, fluoxetine, and sodium docusate. Which of the following is most likely to help confirm the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Palpating the paraspinus muscle
(B): Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh
(C): Straight leg raise
(D): Internal rotation of the extended hip
(E): Radiography
",Straight leg raise,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Straight leg raise.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of pain in the buttocks that travels down the leg, described as ""electrical,"" are consistent with sciatica. Sciatica is commonly caused by compression or irritation of the sciatic nerve, which can occur due to a herniated disc, spinal stenosis, or other spinal conditions. The straight leg raise test is a physical examination maneuver that helps to evaluate for sciatica. 

During the straight leg raise test, the patient lies on their back and the examiner raises the patient's leg while keeping the knee straight. If the maneuver reproduces the patient's pain or causes pain to radiate down the leg, it is considered a positive test for sciatica. This indicates that the sciatic nerve is being stretched or compressed, confirming the diagnosis.

Palpating the paraspinus muscle (A) may help identify muscle spasm or tenderness, but it does not specifically confirm the diagnosis of sciatica.

Flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the thigh (B) is a maneuver used to assess for hip pathology, such as hip joint inflammation or labral tears. It is not specific for sciatica.

Internal rotation of the extended hip (D) is a maneuver used to assess for hip pathology, such as hip joint impingement or labral tears. It is not specific for sciatica.

Radiography (E) may be useful in evaluating for structural abnormalities of the spine, such as fractures or degenerative changes, but it is not the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of sciatica. Imaging studies such as MRI or CT scan may be ordered if conservative management fails or if there are red flags for more serious underlying pathology.",
"A 61-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic with fatigue and mild neck pain for a month. She adds that she is having difficulty swallowing. She denies trouble with her breathing but endorses 5–10 lb of unintentional weight loss over the past few months. On physical exam, the patient’s fingernails appear flat and mild conjunctival pallor is noted. An upper barium esophagram shows an upper esophageal web. A complete blood count reveals:
Hb% 10 gm/dL
Total count (WBC) 11,000 /mm3
Differential count:
Neutrophile 70%
Lymphocytes 25%
Monocytes 5%
ESR 10 mm/hr
What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Plummer-Vinson syndrome
(B): Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
(C): Zenker’s diverticulum
(D): Scleroderma
(E): Achalasia
",Plummer-Vinson syndrome,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Plummer-Vinson syndrome.

Plummer-Vinson syndrome, also known as Paterson-Brown-Kelly syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by the triad of dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), iron deficiency anemia, and esophageal webs. It is more commonly seen in middle-aged women.

In this case, the patient presents with fatigue, mild neck pain, and difficulty swallowing, which are consistent with the symptoms of Plummer-Vinson syndrome. The presence of an upper esophageal web on the barium esophagram further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with iron deficiency anemia, which is commonly seen in Plummer-Vinson syndrome. The low hemoglobin level (10 gm/dL) and the presence of mild conjunctival pallor indicate anemia. The patient's history of unintentional weight loss is also concerning for underlying malnutrition, which can be seen in Plummer-Vinson syndrome.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and findings. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma typically presents with progressive dysphagia, weight loss, and risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use. Zenker's diverticulum is characterized by dysphagia, regurgitation of undigested food, and a palpable mass in the neck. Scleroderma can cause esophageal dysmotility and reflux symptoms, but it is less likely to present with the specific findings seen in this patient. Achalasia is a motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by dysphagia and regurgitation, but it does not typically present with iron deficiency anemia or esophageal webs.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Plummer-Vinson syndrome.",
"A 65-year-old female patient comes to the physician’s office for her annual check-up. The patient’s only complaint is that she feels her vision has been getting more blurry over the past year. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes diagnosed 20 years ago and osteoarthritis. Her medications include metformin, glimepiride, and ibuprofen as needed for pain. Fundoscopic examination of this patient reveals narrowing of retinal arteries and microaneurysms. This patient’s symptoms are likely caused by tissue specific differences in expression of which of the following enzymes?
Options:
(A): Aldose reductase
(B): Sorbitol dehydrogenase
(C): Galactocerebrosidase
(D): Arylsulfatase A
(E): Sphingomyelinase
",Sorbitol dehydrogenase,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Sorbitol dehydrogenase.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, narrowing of retinal arteries, and microaneurysms are consistent with diabetic retinopathy, a complication of long-standing diabetes. In diabetic retinopathy, high blood sugar levels lead to the accumulation of sorbitol in the retina. Sorbitol is formed from glucose by the enzyme aldose reductase. However, sorbitol itself is not toxic to the retina. Instead, it is converted to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. The accumulation of fructose in the retina leads to osmotic damage, causing fluid accumulation and swelling of the retinal cells, which can result in blurry vision. Therefore, tissue-specific differences in the expression of sorbitol dehydrogenase contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the physician for the evaluation of recurrent skin lesions. The episodes of lesions started at the age of 2 months and multiple treatment options have been attempted without success. He has also had several episodes of respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers since birth. The boy attends daycare. His older brother has asthma. The patient's immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 5th percentile for length and 10th percentile for weight. He appears ill. His temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg. Examination shows several raised, erythematous lesions of different sizes over the face, neck, groins, and extremities; some secrete pus. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes are enlarged bilaterally. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Chronic granulomatous disease
(B): Ataxia-telangiectasia
(C): Atopic dermatitis
(D): Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
(E): Chediak-Higashi syndrome
",Chronic granulomatous disease,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Chronic granulomatous disease.

Explanation:
Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to defective phagocyte function. It is an X-linked recessive disorder that primarily affects males. The most common presentation of CGD is recurrent skin and soft tissue infections, which can manifest as raised, erythematous lesions that may secrete pus, as seen in this patient. These skin lesions are often resistant to treatment and can occur at any age, including infancy. In addition to skin infections, patients with CGD are also prone to recurrent respiratory tract infections, enlarged lymph nodes, and recurrent fevers, as seen in this patient. The infections are typically caused by catalase-positive organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia cepacia, and Aspergillus species. The diagnosis of CGD is confirmed by demonstrating a defect in the oxidative burst activity of neutrophils or monocytes. Genetic testing can identify the specific mutation responsible for the disease. Treatment of CGD involves prophylactic antibiotics, antifungal agents, and immunizations to prevent infections. In severe cases, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be considered.",
"A 53-year-old man presents to clinic with a six month history of shoulder pain that is especially bothersome at night. Over the weekend he ""strained his shoulder"" during a pick-up basketball game and reports an acute exacerbation of his pain symptoms. On exam, he complains of pain to palpation just below the acromion. You suspect he has torn his supraspinatus. If correct, which of these functional maneuvers would you expect to be deficient on physical exam?
Options:
(A): Initiation of adduction
(B): External rotation
(C): Initiation of abduction
(D): Completion of abduction
(E): Internal rotation
",Initiation of abduction,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Initiation of abduction.

Explanation:
A tear in the supraspinatus muscle, which is part of the rotator cuff, can result in weakness and pain during certain functional maneuvers. The supraspinatus muscle is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm, which is the movement of lifting the arm away from the body. Therefore, if the supraspinatus is torn, the patient would have difficulty initiating abduction of the arm. This would be assessed by asking the patient to lift their arm away from their body, starting from a resting position. If there is a tear in the supraspinatus, the patient would have pain and weakness during this movement. 

The other options are not directly related to the function of the supraspinatus muscle. 
(A): Initiation of adduction is not affected by a supraspinatus tear.
(B): External rotation is primarily controlled by the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, not the supraspinatus.
(D): Completion of abduction refers to the ability to fully lift the arm away from the body, which may be affected by a supraspinatus tear, but the initiation of abduction is more specific to supraspinatus function.
(E): Internal rotation is not directly affected by a supraspinatus tear.",
"A 58-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of left knee pain as well as stiffness upon waking for about 10–15 minutes. The pain is worse after standing a lot at work and when she climbs stairs. There is no history of trauma. She has hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Her mother died of metastatic breast cancer 15 years ago, at the age of 65 years. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. Current medications include atorvastatin, labetalol, and aspirin. Over the past 2 months, she has been taking over-the-counter ibuprofen as needed for the joint pain. She is 163 cm (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 84 kg (185 lb); BMI is 31.8 kg/m2. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 114/68 mm Hg. Examination of the left knee shows tenderness on palpation of the anteromedial joint line; there is crepitus and pain with full flexion and extension. Serum uric acid concentration is 8.0 mg/dL and erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 15 mm/h. Which of the following is the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee?
Options:
(A): Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray
(B): Calcification of synovia and cartilage on ultrasound
(C): Diffuse lytic-sclerotic bone lesions on x-ray
(D): Joint effusion and pannus on ultrasound
(E): Fluid-filled pouch on ultrasound
",Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with osteoarthritis, which is the most likely diagnosis in this case. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints. It commonly affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and spine.

On imaging, the most likely finding in osteoarthritis is the presence of osteophytes (bone spurs) and joint-space narrowing. Osteophytes are bony outgrowths that develop at the joint margins in response to chronic stress and inflammation. Joint-space narrowing occurs due to the loss of cartilage, resulting in bone-on-bone contact.

X-ray is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating osteoarthritis. It can show the presence of osteophytes, joint-space narrowing, and other signs of degenerative changes in the affected joint. Ultrasound is not typically used for imaging osteoarthritis, and the findings described in options (B), (D), and (E) are not consistent with osteoarthritis.

Therefore, the most likely finding on imaging of the left knee in this patient would be osteophytes with joint-space narrowing on x-ray.",
"A 6-month-old boy presents to a pediatrician for the evaluation of recurrent bacterial infections. He has a history of a variety of bacterial infections since birth. Physical examination reveals light-colored skin with silver-colored hair. The pediatrician suspects an immunodeficiency disorder and decides to order several tests. Study of the boy’s neutrophils reveals that they contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles. Genetic studies show a mutation in the LYST gene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
(B): Common variable immunodeficiency
(C): Chediak-Higashi syndrome
(D): Congenital thymic aplasia
(E): Leukocyte adhesion deficiency–1
",Chediak-Higashi syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Chediak-Higashi syndrome.

Explanation:
Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent bacterial infections, partial albinism (light-colored skin), and silvery hair. It is caused by a mutation in the LYST gene, which leads to defective lysosomal trafficking and impaired phagocytosis by neutrophils and other phagocytic cells. The presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils is a characteristic finding in Chediak-Higashi syndrome. This defect in phagocytosis predisposes patients to recurrent bacterial infections. Other features of Chediak-Higashi syndrome include easy bruising and bleeding due to platelet dysfunction, as well as neurological abnormalities. 

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and is not consistent with the clinical presentation and genetic findings described in the patient.

Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of immunoglobulins and recurrent bacterial infections. However, it does not typically present with the specific features of Chediak-Higashi syndrome, such as partial albinism and silvery hair.

Congenital thymic aplasia, also known as DiGeorge syndrome, is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the thymus gland. It is associated with a variety of clinical features, including cardiac abnormalities and facial dysmorphism, which are not described in the patient.

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) is a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by defects in leukocyte adhesion and migration. It typically presents with severe bacterial infections, delayed separation of the umbilical cord, and impaired wound healing. The presence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neutrophils is not a characteristic finding in LAD-1.",
"A 48-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus complicated by peripheral neuropathy presents to the emergency department for a foot wound that he noticed. He denies any pain, fevers, or chills. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 150/80 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 22/min. An ulcer with associated erythema and purulence is noted on his foot. Based on his radiography, he is diagnosed with osteomyelitis and admitted to the hospital for partial amputation of his right foot. He is given appropriate prophylaxis for tetanus and discharged 5 hospital days later on antibiotics. He returns to the emergency department one week later with difficulty breathing. His temperature is 98°F (37°C), blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, pulse is 130/min, respirations are 27/min, and oxygen saturation is 92% on room air. His amputated foot stump is erythematous and edematous but not tender to palpation. An electrocardiogram reveals sinus tachycardia. He requests something to help calm his breathing down. What is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Complete blood count, type and screen, and order 1 unit of blood
(B): CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen
(C): D-dimer and lower extremity Dopper ultrasound
(D): Deep wound culture and start piperacillin-tazobactam
(E): Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and give oxycodone
",CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) CT angiography of the chest and give oxygen.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with difficulty breathing, tachycardia, and hypotension raises concern for a pulmonary embolism (PE). The risk factors for PE in this patient include recent surgery (partial amputation of the foot), immobilization, and underlying diabetes mellitus. The patient's symptoms, vital signs, and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible PE. CT angiography of the chest is the most appropriate next step in management to confirm the diagnosis of PE. Additionally, the patient's oxygen saturation is low at 92% on room air, indicating hypoxemia. Therefore, supplemental oxygen should be given to improve oxygenation.",
"A 56-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of sudden severe pain in his right great toe. Four months ago, he had an episode of severe joint pain involving his left knee that lasted several days and resolved with over-the-counter analgesics. He has a history of hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and nephrolithiasis. Examination shows erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness of the right metatarsophalangeal joint; range of movement is limited by pain. His serum uric acid is 12 mg/dL. Arthrocentesis yields cloudy fluid with a leukocyte count of 18,500/mm3 (80% segmented neutrophils). Polarized light microscopy of the synovial fluid is shown. Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin
(B): Inhibition of phospholipase A
(C): Inhibition of xanthine oxidase
(D): Increased renal excretion of urate
(E): Inhibition of cyclooxygenase
",Inhibition of xanthine oxidase,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Inhibition of xanthine oxidase.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with acute gouty arthritis, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints. The crystals form when there are elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, a condition known as hyperuricemia. The most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor.

Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of purines, which are precursors to uric acid. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase reduces the production of uric acid, leading to lower levels of uric acid in the blood. This helps prevent the formation of urate crystals and subsequent gouty arthritis attacks.

Options (A) Increased conversion of uric acid to allantoin, (B) Inhibition of phospholipase A, (D) Increased renal excretion of urate, and (E) Inhibition of cyclooxygenase are not the correct choices because they do not address the underlying cause of hyperuricemia, which is the overproduction of uric acid. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase is the most appropriate long-term pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department with severe dyspnea, wheezing, and palpitations. His symptoms began approx. 20 minutes after being stung by a bee on the left arm. Past medical history is significant for hypertension for which he takes labetalol. While being questioned, the patient becomes obtunded. His vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F); blood pressure 85/55 mm Hg; pulse 110/min; respiratory rate 31/min; and oxygen saturation 90% on room air. On physical examination, an area of severe edema and erythema is noted on the extensor surface of the left forearm, and there is severe angioedema of the face and neck. The patient is intubated, and aggressive fluid resuscitation and intramuscular epinephrine are administered. A repeat blood pressure is 90/55 mm Hg, despite these efforts. Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Administer dopamine
(B): Administer glucagon
(C): Administer dexamethasone
(D): Administer diphenhydramine and ranitidine
(E): Administer norepinephrine
",Administer glucagon,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Administer glucagon.

Explanation:
This patient is experiencing anaphylactic shock, which is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. The initial management of anaphylactic shock includes airway management, administration of epinephrine, and aggressive fluid resuscitation. Despite these efforts, the patient's blood pressure remains low. Glucagon is the next best step in the management of this patient.

Glucagon is a hormone that acts on the liver to increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels. In patients with anaphylactic shock, hypotension can be caused by a combination of vasodilation and decreased cardiac contractility. Glucagon can help improve cardiac contractility and increase systemic vascular resistance, leading to an increase in blood pressure.

Administering dopamine (A) is not the best choice in this scenario because dopamine primarily acts as a vasopressor and may not be as effective as glucagon in improving cardiac contractility.

Administering dexamethasone (C) is not the best choice in this scenario because although steroids have anti-inflammatory effects, they are not the first-line treatment for anaphylactic shock. The priority is to stabilize the patient's blood pressure and improve cardiac contractility.

Administering diphenhydramine and ranitidine (D) is not the best choice in this scenario because although antihistamines can help relieve symptoms of an allergic reaction, they are not the first-line treatment for anaphylactic shock. The priority is to stabilize the patient's blood pressure and improve cardiac contractility.

Administering norepinephrine (E) is not the best choice in this scenario because norepinephrine is a potent vasopressor that can increase blood pressure, but it does not directly improve cardiac contractility. Glucagon is a better choice in this scenario as it can improve both cardiac contractility and blood pressure.",
"A 74-year-old man has been treated for prostate cancer for the past 6 months. He is on an experimental drug (drug X) that is used to reduce the action of testosterone by blocking the androgen receptor. Since the initiation of therapy, the growth of the cancerous tissue has slowed. This medication is known to be excreted by the kidneys at the current dose that he is taking. The patient has no significant complaints, except for excessive sweating at times. On physical examination, a small area of tissue around his nipples is enlarged bilaterally. No other abnormal findings are present. Which of the following drugs most likely belongs to be the same class as drug X?
Options:
(A): Leuprolide
(B): Finasteride
(C): Flutamide
(D): Terazosin
(E): Anastrozole
",Flutamide,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Flutamide.

Explanation:
The patient is on a drug that blocks the androgen receptor to reduce the action of testosterone. This class of drugs is known as antiandrogens. Flutamide is an antiandrogen that competitively blocks nuclear androgen receptors in target tissues, such as the prostate. It inhibits androgen-dependent DNA and protein synthesis, resulting in growth arrest or transient tumor regression. Flutamide is commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer, especially in combination with other therapies. 

Leuprolide (A) is a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist that suppresses the production of testosterone by the testes. It does not directly block the androgen receptor.

Finasteride (B) is a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor that reduces the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It is primarily used in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and male pattern baldness.

Terazosin (D) is an alpha-1 adrenergic blocker that relaxes the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urinary flow in patients with BPH. It does not have antiandrogenic effects.

Anastrozole (E) is an aromatase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of androgens to estrogens. It is primarily used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It does not block the androgen receptor.",
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after falling down several stairs. He is a known alcoholic. He was started on IV fluids and received a head CT, which was negative. It was decided that he would be watched for one day before being discharged, after a negative work-up. Suddenly, he is unable to move his arms and legs in addition to experiencing difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking. Which of the following electrolyte imbalances was most likely corrected too aggressively?
Options:
(A): Hyponatremia
(B): Hypernatremia
(C): Hypokalemia
(D): Hyperkalemia
(E): Hypochloremia
",Hyponatremia,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Hyponatremia.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of being unable to move his arms and legs, difficulty chewing, swallowing, moving his face, and speaking are consistent with a condition called central pontine myelinolysis (CPM). CPM is a neurological disorder that occurs when there is a rapid correction of hyponatremia, leading to damage of the myelin sheath in the brainstem.

Hyponatremia is a condition characterized by low levels of sodium in the blood. In this case, the patient was started on IV fluids, which likely corrected his hyponatremia too aggressively. Rapid correction of hyponatremia can cause an osmotic shift of water into the brain cells, leading to swelling and damage to the myelin sheath in the brainstem.

Hypernatremia (B) is the opposite of hyponatremia and refers to high levels of sodium in the blood. Hypokalemia (C) is a condition characterized by low levels of potassium in the blood. Hyperkalemia (D) is the opposite of hypokalemia and refers to high levels of potassium in the blood. Hypochloremia (E) is a condition characterized by low levels of chloride in the blood. None of these electrolyte imbalances are consistent with the patient's symptoms and the scenario provided.",
"A previously healthy 67-year-old man comes to the physician for routine health maintenance evaluation. He works at a community center and volunteers at a local homeless shelter. A tuberculin skin test shows an induration of 14 mm. An x-ray of the chest is normal. Treatment with an antimycobacterial drug is initiated. Two months later, he has numbness and burning over both feet and an unsteady gait. Physical examination shows decreased sensation to light touch extending from the soles of the feet to the mid-shin bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s current symptoms?
Options:
(A): Accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine
(B): Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol
(C): Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons
(D): Impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP
(E): Degeneration of the dorsal columns
",Accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (C): Segmental demyelination of peripheral axons.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of numbness and burning over both feet, along with an unsteady gait and decreased sensation to light touch, are consistent with peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy refers to damage or dysfunction of the peripheral nerves, which can result in sensory, motor, or autonomic deficits.

In this case, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is segmental demyelination of peripheral axons. Demyelination refers to the loss or destruction of the myelin sheath, which is the protective covering around nerve fibers. Segmental demyelination refers to the selective loss of myelin in certain segments of the nerve fibers.

The patient's history of working at a community center and volunteering at a homeless shelter suggests a potential exposure to infectious agents, such as tuberculosis. The initiation of antimycobacterial drug treatment further supports this possibility. It is known that certain infections, including tuberculosis, can cause peripheral neuropathy through mechanisms such as direct nerve damage or immune-mediated processes.

Accumulation of S-adenosylmethionine (Choice A) is not a known cause of peripheral neuropathy.

Intracellular accumulation of sorbitol (Choice B) is seen in conditions such as diabetes mellitus, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.

Impaired breakdown of glucose to ATP (Choice D) is seen in conditions such as diabetic neuropathy, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.

Degeneration of the dorsal columns (Choice E) would typically present with sensory deficits such as loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation, rather than the symptoms described by the patient.",
"A 64-year-old male presents to his primary care physician with a complaint of bilateral knee pain that has been present for the past several years but has worsened recently. He reports pain with climbing stairs and with extended walks of greater than 100 yards. The pain worsens with activity throughout the day and is alleviated by periods of rest. He states that he has minimal morning stiffness, lasting approximately 5-10 minutes after waking up most days. Physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation of the bony structures on the medial aspect of the bilateral knees as well as crepitus and a decreased range of motion, limited at the extremes of flexion and extension. Both knee joints are cool to touch and exhibit bony enlargement upon palpation of the medial joint line. Which of the following studies would be indicated for further work-up of this patient's presenting condition?
Options:
(A): Complete blood count (CBC)
(B): Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
(C): Rheumatoid factor (RF)
(D): MRI of the knee
(E): No further work-up needed
",No further work-up needed,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) No further work-up needed.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. OA is a degenerative joint disease characterized by progressive loss of articular cartilage, joint space narrowing, and bony enlargement. The patient's symptoms of bilateral knee pain that worsens with activity, improves with rest, and is associated with limited range of motion are consistent with OA.

Further work-up with laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and rheumatoid factor (RF) are not indicated in this case. These tests are typically used to evaluate for inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which is not suggested by the patient's history and physical examination findings. Inflammatory markers, such as ESR and RF, are usually elevated in inflammatory arthritis but are typically normal in OA.

An MRI of the knee is not necessary for the diagnosis of OA in this patient. The diagnosis of OA can usually be made based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Imaging studies, such as X-rays, may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of joint damage, but an MRI is not typically required.

Therefore, no further work-up is needed in this patient as the clinical presentation is consistent with OA, and additional tests or imaging studies are unlikely to provide additional useful information. Treatment for OA typically involves lifestyle modifications, physical therapy, pain management, and possibly the use of assistive devices or surgical interventions if conservative measures fail.",
"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of pallor and rash for 2 days. She had a 4-day history of diarrhea and vomiting that subsided two days ago. One month ago, she had a 3-day episode of high fever, followed by a rash with bright red discoloration over her cheeks for two days before subsiding without treatment. Her vaccinations are up-to-date. She appears pale and irritable. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows petechiae on her trunk and extremities. Abdominal examination shows diffuse abdominal tenderness with hyperactive bowel sounds. The remainder of the exam shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8 g/dL

A peripheral blood smear shows schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of these findings?""
Options:
(A): Escherichia coli infection
(B): Parvovirus B19 infection
(C): Disseminated intravascular coagulation
(D): Immune thrombocytopenic purpura
(E): Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
",Escherichia coli infection,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Escherichia coli infection.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of pallor, rash, petechiae, and abdominal tenderness, along with laboratory findings of anemia (hemoglobin 8 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count 49,000/mm3), and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, are consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is most commonly caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), particularly serotype O157:H7. STEC infection typically presents with a prodrome of diarrhea and vomiting, followed by the development of HUS. The toxin produced by STEC damages the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, leading to microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal dysfunction. The abdominal tenderness and hyperactive bowel sounds seen in this patient are consistent with the presence of an underlying gastrointestinal infection. Parvovirus B19 infection can cause a similar clinical presentation, but it typically occurs in children with a recent viral illness and is associated with a ""slapped cheek"" rash. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a consumptive coagulopathy that can occur in the setting of severe infection, trauma, or malignancy. It is characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, leading to thrombosis and consumption of platelets and coagulation factors. DIC is associated with abnormal coagulation studies, including prolonged prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia due to platelet destruction. It typically presents with mucocutaneous bleeding and bruising, but not with the microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and schistocytes seen in this patient. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare disorder characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, neurologic abnormalities, renal dysfunction, and fever. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme ADAMTS13, which normally cleaves von Willebrand factor. TTP is not typically associated with an underlying infection.",
"A 76-year-old man presents to the physician because of dyspepsia and weight loss over the past 6 months. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. A diagnostic workup including endoscopy and biopsy shows gastric adenocarcinoma. Before further workup and staging, the biopsy results are discussed with the patient. He refuses any type of life-prolonging treatment, including chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, but he requests appropriate palliative care without any significant burden of healthcare costs. Regarding this patient’s eligibility for hospice care, what is the most appropriate next step?
Options:
(A): A trial of life-extending treatment
(B): Determining patient’s life-expectancy without treatment
(C): Establishing the presence of metastasis
(D): Follow-up until significant cognitive or functional disability develops
(E): No further steps are required because the patient already qualifies for hospice care
",Determining patient’s life-expectancy without treatment,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Determining patient’s life-expectancy without treatment.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has refused any type of life-prolonging treatment and requests appropriate palliative care. To determine the patient's eligibility for hospice care, it is important to assess the patient's life-expectancy without treatment. This involves evaluating the prognosis and estimating how long the patient is likely to live without any interventions.

Determining the patient's life-expectancy without treatment is crucial in determining if the patient meets the criteria for hospice care. Hospice care is typically provided to patients with a life expectancy of 6 months or less. By assessing the patient's prognosis, healthcare providers can determine if the patient qualifies for hospice care and can provide appropriate palliative care without burdening the patient with unnecessary healthcare costs.

Establishing the presence of metastasis (option C) is important for staging and treatment planning but is not directly related to determining eligibility for hospice care. Follow-up until significant cognitive or functional disability develops (option D) is not necessary in this case as the patient has already expressed their preference for palliative care without life-prolonging treatment. A trial of life-extending treatment (option A) is not appropriate as the patient has clearly refused any type of life-prolonging treatment. No further steps are required because the patient already qualifies for hospice care (option E) is not the most appropriate next step as the patient's eligibility for hospice care needs to be determined based on their life-expectancy without treatment.",
"A 29-year-old female presents to the clinic for a regular check-up. She has no specific complaints. Vital signs include: blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 76/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, and temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). Her physical examination is within normal limits. The woman’s complete blood count shows an absolute increase in the cells shown in the first image. Which of the following is true regarding these cells?
Options:
(A): These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues.
(B): These cells are responsible for the production of antibodies.
(C): These cells express CD25 on their surfaces.
(D): These cells normally constitute 25–40% of total leucocyte count.
(E): These cells have lymphoid origin.
",These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues.,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): These cells transform to macrophages when they migrate to peripheral tissues.

Explanation:
The cells shown in the image are monocytes. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream. When they migrate to peripheral tissues, they undergo a process called differentiation and transform into macrophages. Macrophages are responsible for phagocytosis, which is the process of engulfing and destroying foreign particles, dead cells, and cellular debris. They play a crucial role in the immune response and are involved in both innate and adaptive immunity. Therefore, option (A) is the correct answer. 

Option (B) is incorrect because monocytes are not responsible for the production of antibodies. Antibodies are produced by a different type of white blood cell called B lymphocytes.

Option (C) is incorrect because monocytes do not express CD25 on their surfaces. CD25 is a marker that is typically found on activated T lymphocytes.

Option (D) is incorrect because monocytes normally constitute a smaller percentage of the total leukocyte count, typically around 2-10%.

Option (E) is incorrect because monocytes have myeloid origin, not lymphoid origin. Lymphocytes, on the other hand, are a different type of white blood cell that are involved in adaptive immunity.",
"A 23-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. The patient states she has pain in the right side of her abdomen which started yesterday and has been worsening. She has experienced a few episodes of vomiting and diarrhea during this time. The patient has a past medical history of constipation which is treated with fiber supplements. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 110/68 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam, you note a young woman who appears to be in pain. Cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. Abdominal exam is notable for right lower quadrant pain that is reproducible when the left lower quadrant is palpated. The patient is given morphine. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Abdominal radiograph
(B): ß-hCG
(C): CT scan
(D): Stool occult blood
(E): Ultrasound
",ß-hCG,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (C) CT scan.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with right lower quadrant pain, tenderness on palpation, and pain reproduced with palpation of the left lower quadrant is concerning for appendicitis. Appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain in young adults and typically presents with periumbilical pain that migrates to the right lower quadrant. The presence of vomiting and diarrhea can be seen in some cases of appendicitis, especially if there is an associated infection. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, but the tachycardia may be a sign of pain or inflammation. The next best step in management is to obtain a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. CT scan is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating suspected appendicitis due to its high sensitivity and specificity. It can help confirm the diagnosis, assess the severity of inflammation, and identify complications such as abscess formation or perforation. If the CT scan confirms appendicitis, the patient will likely require surgical intervention for appendectomy.",
"A 24-year-old Asian woman is admitted to the hospital at 30 weeks gestation with nausea, vomiting, and right upper quadrant pain. She is gravida 2 para 0 with a history of the same complaints in her last pregnancy which ended with a stillbirth at the 31st week. Her older sister had preeclampsia in both of her pregnancies. Currently, the patient is responsive but lethargic. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate 85/min, respiratory rate 15/min, and temperature 36.4°C (97.5°F). The physical examination shows jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness, and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. The patient’s laboratory findings are as follows:
Erythrocyte count 2.7 million/mm3
Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dL
Hematocrit 0.56
Reticulocyte count 1.1%
Leukocyte count 8,300/mm3
Thrombocyte count 190,000/mm3
Total bilirubin 5.3 mg/dL (91 µmol/L)
Conjugated bilirubin 4.2 mg/dL (72 µmol/L)
Alanine Transaminase (ALT) 101 U/L
Aspartate Transaminase (AST) 99 U/L
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (80 µmol/L)
Which of the following factors is a risk factor for this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): The patient’s age
(B): The patient’s race
(C): Nulliparity
(D): History in the previous pregnancy
(E): History of preeclampsia in a sibling
",History in the previous pregnancy,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): History in the previous pregnancy.

Explanation:
The patient's history of the same complaints in her previous pregnancy, which ended with a stillbirth at the 31st week, is a risk factor for her current condition. This history suggests a possible recurrence of the same condition, which is likely preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy characterized by new-onset hypertension and end-organ damage, such as liver dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and thrombocytopenia. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, and laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes, thrombocytopenia, and elevated bilirubin are consistent with the diagnosis of preeclampsia. The history of preeclampsia in her sister's pregnancies also suggests a familial predisposition to the condition.",
"A 44-year-old obese African-American male presents to clinic with complaints of 3 days of fatigue and dark urine. He has had several similar episodes since birth, all of which resolved spontaneously. He has a 5-year history of poorly controlled type II diabetes mellitus and was started on glipizide one week ago. Prior to the episode, he felt well without any upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He predominantly eats fast food, although he tried a new Lebanese restaurant about one month ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Viral Infection
(B): Bacterial Infection
(C): Food
(D): Medication
(E): Idiopathic
",Medication,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Medication.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dark urine, along with a history of similar episodes since birth, suggest a possible underlying condition called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD deficiency is an inherited condition that affects the red blood cells and can lead to episodes of hemolysis, where the red blood cells break down prematurely. These episodes can be triggered by certain medications, infections, or foods.

In this case, the patient's recent initiation of glipizide, a medication used to treat type II diabetes, is the most likely cause of his symptoms. Glipizide is known to cause hemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency. The patient's poorly controlled diabetes and recent initiation of glipizide make it more likely that the medication is the cause of his symptoms.

The other options are less likely causes in this case. There is no mention of upper respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, making a viral or bacterial infection less likely. While the patient did try a new Lebanese restaurant, there is no specific information to suggest that the food is the cause of his symptoms. Idiopathic means that the cause is unknown, but in this case, there is a clear potential cause with the recent initiation of glipizide.",
"A 32-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Examination shows erythema with scaling on both cheeks that spares the nasolabial folds and two 1-cm ulcers in the oral cavity. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Decreased lymphocyte count
(B): Increased platelet count
(C): Increased complement component 3
(D): Increased prothrombin time
(E): Decreased gamma globulin
",Decreased lymphocyte count,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Decreased lymphocyte count.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. SLE is characterized by a dysregulated immune response, leading to the production of autoantibodies and immune complex formation. 

One of the common laboratory findings in SLE is lymphopenia, which is a decreased lymphocyte count. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that play a crucial role in the immune response. In SLE, the immune system attacks and destroys lymphocytes, leading to a decreased count.

The other options are not typically associated with SLE. Increased platelet count (option B) is not a characteristic finding in SLE. Increased complement component 3 (option C) may be seen in some cases of SLE, but it is not a specific finding. Increased prothrombin time (option D) is not typically seen in SLE. Decreased gamma globulin (option E) is not a specific finding in SLE and can be seen in various other conditions.",
"A 66-year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction presents to your primary care office with complaints of dyspnea on exertion and swollen feet and ankles. On exam, you note an elevated JVP and 2+ pitting edema of bilateral lower extremities. What is the most likely explanation for this patient's lower extremity edema?
Options:
(A): Increase in capillary pressure
(B): Decrease in plasma proteins
(C): Increase in capillary permeability
(D): Increase in colloid osmotic pressure
(E): Increase in interstitial fluid pressure
",Increase in capillary pressure,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Increase in capillary pressure.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of myocardial infarction, the most likely explanation for the lower extremity edema is an increase in capillary pressure. Elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and pitting edema of the bilateral lower extremities are indicative of volume overload, which is commonly seen in chronic heart failure. In heart failure, the heart is unable to pump blood effectively, leading to an increase in venous pressure and subsequently an increase in capillary pressure. This increased pressure causes fluid to leak out of the capillaries and into the surrounding tissues, resulting in edema.

Decrease in plasma proteins (B) would lead to a decrease in colloid osmotic pressure, which would actually cause fluid to move into the capillaries rather than out into the tissues. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Increase in capillary permeability (C) is seen in conditions such as inflammation or infection, but it is not the most likely explanation in this patient with a history of myocardial infarction and elevated JVP.

Increase in colloid osmotic pressure (D) would cause fluid to move into the capillaries rather than out into the tissues. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Increase in interstitial fluid pressure (E) would also cause fluid to move into the capillaries rather than out into the tissues. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation.",
"A 49-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He feels well and has no history of serious illness. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years and drinks two to three glasses of wine weekly. This patient should be counseled about increased risk for which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Pancreatic adenocarcinoma
(B): Gastric MALT lymphoma
(C): Esophageal varices
(D): Porcelain gallbladder
(E): Hepatic steatosis
",Pancreatic adenocarcinoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Explanation:
Smoking is a well-established risk factor for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Studies have shown that smokers have a two-fold increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer compared to non-smokers. The risk increases with the duration and intensity of smoking. In this case, the patient has a history of smoking one pack of cigarettes daily for the past 25 years, which puts him at an increased risk for developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

The other options are not directly associated with smoking or the patient's risk factors. Gastric MALT lymphoma is typically associated with chronic Helicobacter pylori infection, not smoking. Esophageal varices are commonly seen in patients with liver cirrhosis, which is usually caused by chronic alcohol abuse, not the moderate alcohol consumption described in the patient's history. Porcelain gallbladder is a condition where the gallbladder wall becomes calcified, and its association with smoking is not well-established. Hepatic steatosis, or fatty liver disease, is commonly associated with obesity, diabetes, and alcohol abuse, but not specifically with smoking. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, and its association with smoking is complex, with some studies suggesting that smoking may have a protective effect against the development of ulcerative colitis.",
"A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of difficulty sleeping and fatigue. Menses occur at irregular 35- to 50-day intervals and last 3–7 days. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. She has had an unintentional 10-kg (22-lb) weight gain over this period. She also reports decreased sexual desire and increased hair growth on her face and arms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 150/90 mm Hg. Physical examination shows central obesity, increased pigmented hair over the chin and upper lip, and purple stretch marks on the abdomen. She has a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of her neck and decreased proximal muscle tone and strength. Serum studies show:
Na+ 154 mEq/L
K+ 2.8 mEq/L
Cl- 103 mEq/L
HCO3- 30 mEq/L
Creatinine 0.9 mg/dL
Glucose 236 mg/dL
ACTH 2 pg/mL (N = 7–50)
Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?""
Options:
(A): Metyrapone therapy
(B): Adrenalectomy
(C): Polychemotherapy and radiation therapy
(D): Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy
(E): Partial nephrectomy
",Adrenalectomy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Adrenalectomy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, she is most likely suffering from Cushing's syndrome, which is characterized by excessive cortisol production. The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma, which leads to autonomous cortisol production.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Cushing's syndrome. She has central obesity, increased pigmented hair (hirsutism), purple stretch marks (striae), and a prominent hump of fat over the base of the dorsum of her neck (buffalo hump). These physical findings are classic signs of excessive cortisol production.

The laboratory findings also support the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. The patient has hypokalemia (low potassium), which is commonly seen in Cushing's syndrome due to increased mineralocorticoid activity. The elevated glucose level indicates impaired glucose metabolism, which is another common feature of Cushing's syndrome.

The most appropriate treatment for Cushing's syndrome caused by an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma is surgical removal of the affected adrenal gland, known as adrenalectomy. This will eliminate the source of excessive cortisol production and alleviate the patient's symptoms.

Metyrapone therapy (option A) is a medical treatment for Cushing's syndrome that inhibits cortisol synthesis. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment in this case because the patient has an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma, which requires surgical removal.

Polychemotherapy and radiation therapy (option C) are not indicated for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome caused by an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma. These treatments are typically reserved for cases of Cushing's syndrome caused by pituitary adenomas or ectopic ACTH production.

Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy (option D) is a surgical procedure used to remove pituitary adenomas that are causing Cushing's syndrome. However, this is not the most appropriate treatment in this case because the patient has an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.

Partial nephrectomy (option E) is a surgical procedure used to remove a portion of the kidney. It is not indicated for the treatment of Cushing's syndrome caused by an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma.",
"A scientist observes a myocyte beating in cell culture. Which step is the most direct necessary component of relaxation for this cell?
Options:
(A): Influx of sodium ions
(B): Efflux of potassium ions
(C): Influx of calcium ions from the sacroplasmic reticulum
(D): Influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte
(E): Efflux of calcium ions
",Efflux of calcium ions,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Efflux of calcium ions.

Explanation:
During relaxation of a myocyte, the most direct necessary component is the efflux of calcium ions. Calcium ions play a crucial role in muscle contraction, and their removal from the cytoplasm is essential for relaxation to occur. 

In a myocyte, depolarization of the cell membrane leads to calcium influx through L-type calcium channels (LTCC), which activate ryanodine receptors (RyR2) to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Calcium then binds to troponin C, allowing myosin heads to interact with actin filaments and cause contraction.

To initiate relaxation, calcium must be removed from the cytoplasm. This is achieved through the pumping of calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum by the sarcoendoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) and the efflux of calcium out of the cell through the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX). The efflux of calcium ions is the most direct necessary component of relaxation for a myocyte.

Influx of sodium ions (A) and influx of calcium ions from outside the myocyte (D) are not directly involved in relaxation. Efflux of potassium ions (B) is important for repolarization of the cell membrane, not relaxation. Influx of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (C) is involved in muscle contraction, not relaxation.",
"Two days after admission to the hospital for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, a 35-year-old man develops nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps. He has a history of diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. He has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and reports occasionally using marijuana. His temperature is 38.7°C (101.1°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg. Laboratory studies show:

Which of the following would have been most effective in preventing this patient's current symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Urine alkalinization
(B): Corticosteroids
(C): Rasburicase
(D): Allopurinol
(E): Intravenous hydration
",Intravenous hydration,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Intravenous hydration.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps are consistent with tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which is a potentially life-threatening oncologic emergency that can occur after the initiation of chemotherapy in patients with rapidly proliferating malignancies, such as acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). TLS is characterized by the release of intracellular contents, including potassium, phosphate, and uric acid, into the bloodstream due to the rapid destruction of tumor cells.

In this patient, the laboratory findings of hyperkalemia (K+ 5.9 mEq/L), hyperphosphatemia (phosphorus 8.9 mg/dL), and hyperuricemia (uric acid 11.2 mg/dL) support the diagnosis of TLS. The elevated levels of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid can lead to various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and muscle cramps.

The most effective intervention to prevent TLS and its associated symptoms is intravenous hydration. Hydration helps to maintain adequate urine output and promotes the excretion of the released intracellular contents, including potassium, phosphate, and uric acid. By increasing urine flow, hydration can prevent the precipitation of uric acid crystals in the renal tubules, which can lead to acute kidney injury.

Urine alkalinization (option A) is used in the management of TLS to prevent the formation of uric acid crystals in the renal tubules. However, in this patient, the most appropriate initial intervention is intravenous hydration.

Corticosteroids (option B) are not indicated for the prevention of TLS. They may be used in the treatment of TLS-associated complications, such as hyperuricemia-induced acute kidney injury or tumor-associated inflammation.

Rasburicase (option C) is a recombinant urate oxidase enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of uric acid to allantoin, a more soluble and easily excreted compound. Rasburicase is used in the treatment of established TLS to rapidly lower serum uric acid levels. It is not used for prevention.

Allopurinol (option D) is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor that reduces the production of uric acid. It is used for the prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in patients at risk for TLS. However, in this patient, the most appropriate initial intervention is intravenous hydration.

Therefore, the most effective intervention in preventing this patient's current symptoms of TLS is intravenous hydration.",
"The menses are 4 weeks overdue in a 23-year-old sexually active woman, thus she is scheduled for an ultrasound examination. The result is shown in the exhibit. What is the function of the structure marked with the green arrow?
Options:
(A): Removal of nitrogenous waste
(B): Embryonic hematopoiesis
(C): Production of amniotic fluid
(D): Production of progesterone
(E): Gas exchange
",Embryonic hematopoiesis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Embryonic hematopoiesis.

Explanation:
The structure marked with the green arrow in the ultrasound image is the yolk sac. The yolk sac is an important structure during early embryonic development. It plays a crucial role in providing nutrients to the developing embryo and is involved in the production of blood cells, a process known as hematopoiesis.

During the early stages of pregnancy, the yolk sac is responsible for supplying nutrients to the developing embryo before the placenta is fully formed and functional. It also serves as the site of early blood cell formation, specifically the production of red blood cells.

Therefore, the function of the structure marked with the green arrow in the ultrasound image is embryonic hematopoiesis, making option (B) the correct answer.",
"A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because he has had multiple falls and multiple episodes of dizziness over the past 6 weeks. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. He drinks one pint of rum daily. He works as a foreman in a factory that produces industrial solvents. He is alert and oriented to time, place, and person. His temperature is 36.7°C (98.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 108/70 mm Hg. Examination shows a wide-based gait. The patient is unable to stand with his feet together without support. There is a coarse tremor of the hands when he is asked to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone are normal in all extremities. Sensation to pain, vibration, and position is intact bilaterally. Rapid alternating movements of the hands is impaired. Mental status examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Korsakoff syndrome
(B): Subacute combined degeneration
(C): Methanol poisoning
(D): Cerebellar degeneration
(E): Wernicke's encephalopathy
",Cerebellar degeneration,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Cerebellar degeneration.

Explanation:
This patient's symptoms of multiple falls, dizziness, wide-based gait, and impaired rapid alternating movements of the hands are consistent with cerebellar dysfunction. The patient's alcohol use, as well as his occupation in a factory that produces industrial solvents, raises suspicion for toxic exposure. Chronic alcohol use can lead to cerebellar degeneration, which is characterized by ataxia, intention tremor, and dysarthria. Industrial solvents, such as toluene, can also cause cerebellar degeneration. The patient's normal muscle strength and tone, intact sensation, and normal mental status examination make other causes less likely. Korsakoff syndrome is characterized by anterograde and retrograde amnesia, not cerebellar dysfunction. Subacute combined degeneration is caused by vitamin B12 deficiency and typically presents with sensory ataxia, not cerebellar dysfunction. Methanol poisoning can cause optic nerve damage and metabolic acidosis, but it does not typically present with cerebellar dysfunction. Wernicke's encephalopathy is characterized by the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, but this patient does not have confusion or ophthalmoplegia.",
"A 7-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother for a well-child examination. The mother reports that she had her first menstrual period 1 week ago. She has no history of serious illness. Immunizations are up-to-date. Physical examination shows Tanner stage 3 breast development and pubic hair. Without treatment, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following as an adult?
Options:
(A): Delayed skeletal maturity
(B): Short stature
(C): Genu varum
(D): Osteoporosis
(E): Coarse facial features
",Short stature,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Short stature.

Explanation:
The scenario describes a 7-year-old girl who has already started her menstrual period and is showing signs of breast development and pubic hair. This is consistent with precocious puberty, which is the early onset of puberty before the age of 8 in girls. 

Without treatment, girls with precocious puberty are at risk for accelerated growth and bone maturation, which can lead to early closure of the growth plates and ultimately result in shorter stature as an adult. This is because the growth plates, which are responsible for longitudinal bone growth, close earlier than normal due to the early onset of puberty.

Delayed skeletal maturity (option A) is not the correct answer because precocious puberty actually leads to accelerated skeletal maturation, not delayed maturation.

Genu varum (option C) refers to bowlegs, which is not a common complication of precocious puberty.

Osteoporosis (option D) is not the correct answer because precocious puberty does not directly increase the risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is more commonly associated with hormonal imbalances later in life, such as menopause.

Coarse facial features (option E) are not a common complication of precocious puberty. Coarse facial features are more commonly associated with genetic disorders or certain medical conditions, such as acromegaly.

Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Short stature.",
"A 67-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for a follow up appointment. He was released from the hospital 1 week ago for an appropriately managed ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); however, he has not filled any of his prescriptions and did not attend his follow up appointment as scheduled. The patient has a past medical history of hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. His temperature is 97.5°F (36.4°C), blood pressure is 167/118 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. Physical exam is notable for jugular venous distention and bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Echocardiography demonstrates an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following medications will have the greatest mortality benefit in this patient?
Options:
(A): Atenolol
(B): Hydrochlorothiazide
(C): Lisinopril
(D): Metoprolol succinate
(E): Propranolol
",Metoprolol succinate,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Metoprolol succinate.

Explanation:
In this patient with a history of STEMI and signs of heart failure (jugular venous distention, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema), the medication that will have the greatest mortality benefit is a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. Metoprolol succinate is a selective beta-1 blocker that has been specifically studied in patients with heart failure and has shown to reduce mortality and hospitalizations. Atenolol and propranolol are also beta-blockers, but they have not been shown to have the same mortality benefit as metoprolol succinate. Hydrochlorothiazide is a diuretic that can help with blood pressure control but does not have the same mortality benefit as beta-blockers in heart failure. Lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor that can also help with blood pressure control and has been shown to reduce mortality in heart failure, but beta-blockers have a greater mortality benefit in this patient population.",
"A 61-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of a productive cough and worsening shortness of breath. He has had frequent episodes of a productive cough over the past 3 years. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for 30 years but quit 1 year ago. He appears distressed. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 91%. Chest auscultation reveals diffuse wheezes and coarse crackles. A chest x-ray shows increased lung lucency bilaterally and flattening of the diaphragm. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Prednisone and albuterol
(B): Albuterol and montelukast
(C): Prednisone and tiotropium
(D): Albuterol and theophylline
(E): Roflumilast and prednisone
",Prednisone and albuterol,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Prednisone and albuterol.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and presentation, he is likely experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient's history of smoking, chronic cough, and wheezes on auscultation are consistent with COPD. The chest x-ray findings of increased lung lucency and flattening of the diaphragm suggest hyperinflation, which is commonly seen in COPD.

The most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for an acute exacerbation of COPD is a combination of a short-acting bronchodilator (such as albuterol) and an oral corticosteroid (such as prednisone). Albuterol is a short-acting beta-agonist that helps to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow. Prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that helps to reduce airway inflammation and improve symptoms.

Montelukast (option B) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist that is typically used for the maintenance treatment of asthma, not for acute exacerbations of COPD.

Tiotropium (option C) is a long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that is used for the maintenance treatment of COPD, but it is not typically used for acute exacerbations.

Theophylline (option D) is a bronchodilator that can be used for the maintenance treatment of COPD, but it is not typically used for acute exacerbations.

Roflumilast (option E) is a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor that is used for the maintenance treatment of severe COPD with chronic bronchitis, but it is not typically used for acute exacerbations.

Therefore, the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient is prednisone and albuterol. Prednisone will help to reduce airway inflammation, while albuterol will help to relieve bronchospasm and improve airflow.",
"An investigator is studying cellular regeneration of epithelial cells. She has obtained a tissue sample from a normal thyroid gland for histopathologic examination. It shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. Which of the following parts of the female reproductive tract is also lined by this type of epithelium?
Options:
(A): Ovaries
(B): Vagina
(C): Fallopian tubes
(D): Vulva
(E): Cervix
",Ovaries,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Ovaries.

Explanation:
The tissue sample from the normal thyroid gland shows follicles lined by a single layer of cube-like cells with large central nuclei. This type of epithelium is characteristic of the ovarian surface epithelium, which lines the outer surface of the ovaries. The ovarian surface epithelium is responsible for the production of ovarian hormones and the release of eggs during ovulation. It is important to note that the other options listed (vagina, fallopian tubes, vulva, cervix) are not lined by this type of epithelium.",
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health examination. She feels well but asks for advice about smoking cessation. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 7 years. She has tried to quit several times without success. During the previous attempts, she has been extremely nervous and also gained weight. She has also tried nicotine lozenges but stopped taking them because of severe headaches and insomnia. She has bulimia nervosa. She takes no medications. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 68 kg (150 lb); BMI is 24 kg/m2. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Diazepam
(B): Nicotine patch
(C): Varenicline
(D): Motivational interviewing
(E): Fluoxetine
",Varenicline,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Varenicline.

Explanation:
Varenicline is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. Varenicline is a first-line pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation and has been shown to be effective in increasing quit rates. It works by acting as a partial agonist at the α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, reducing the rewarding effects of nicotine and decreasing withdrawal symptoms. It is more effective than nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) alone and has been shown to double the odds of quitting smoking compared to placebo.

In this case, the patient has a history of unsuccessful quit attempts and has experienced severe headaches and insomnia with the use of nicotine lozenges. Varenicline would be a suitable option for her as it does not have the same side effects as nicotine lozenges. It is important to note that varenicline has been associated with neuropsychiatric side effects, including changes in behavior, agitation, depressed mood, hostility, and suicidal ideation. However, these side effects are rare and the benefits of smoking cessation outweigh the risks in most patients.

Diazepam (A) is not indicated for smoking cessation and is not recommended as a first-line treatment. It is a benzodiazepine that is primarily used for anxiety and does not directly target nicotine addiction.

Nicotine patch (B) is a form of NRT and can be effective for smoking cessation. However, varenicline has been shown to be more effective than NRT alone and would be a better choice for this patient.

Motivational interviewing (D) is a counseling technique that can be used to enhance motivation and readiness to change. While it can be a helpful adjunct to pharmacotherapy, it is not a standalone treatment for smoking cessation.

Fluoxetine (E) is an antidepressant that is not indicated for smoking cessation. While it may be used in patients with comorbid depression, it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient.",
"A hospitalized 34-year-old man with severe diarrhea and bloating for 1 month is diagnosed with celiac disease based on serology and duodenal biopsy. He has no history of any serious illnesses and takes no medications. He has no history of recent travel. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. At discharge from the hospital, he is given complete instructions for a strict gluten-free diet. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of the severe diarrhea and bloating?
Options:
(A): Avoiding all dairy products
(B): Diphenoxylate
(C): Empirical therapy with metronidazole
(D): Prednisone
(E): Restriction of soy products
",Avoiding all dairy products,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Avoiding all dairy products.

Explanation:
In patients with celiac disease, the small intestine is unable to properly digest gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This leads to inflammation and damage to the lining of the small intestine, resulting in symptoms such as severe diarrhea and bloating.

Avoiding all dairy products is the most appropriate recommendation for the temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating in this patient. This is because many individuals with celiac disease also have lactose intolerance, which is the inability to digest lactose, the sugar found in milk and dairy products. Lactose intolerance can cause symptoms such as diarrhea and bloating. By avoiding all dairy products, the patient can prevent further irritation to the already damaged small intestine and alleviate these symptoms.

It is important to note that this recommendation is temporary and aimed at controlling symptoms while the patient adjusts to a strict gluten-free diet. The primary treatment for celiac disease is a lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet, which involves avoiding all foods and products that contain gluten. This will allow the small intestine to heal and alleviate symptoms in the long term.

The other options are not appropriate for the temporary control of severe diarrhea and bloating in this patient:

(B) Diphenoxylate: Diphenoxylate is an antidiarrheal medication that is commonly used to treat acute diarrhea. However, in celiac disease, the underlying cause of the diarrhea is the inability to digest gluten, not an acute infection or inflammation. Therefore, diphenoxylate would not address the root cause of the symptoms.

(C) Empirical therapy with metronidazole: Metronidazole is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections. However, celiac disease is not caused by a bacterial infection, and empirical therapy with metronidazole would not be effective in treating the symptoms.

(D) Prednisone: Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication that is commonly used to reduce inflammation in various conditions. While it may be used in certain cases of celiac disease, such as refractory celiac disease or severe complications, it is not the most appropriate recommendation for temporary control of symptoms in this patient.

(E) Restriction of soy products: Soy products do not contain gluten and are generally safe for individuals with celiac disease. Restricting soy products would not address the underlying cause of the symptoms and would not provide temporary relief for severe diarrhea and bloating.",
"A 70-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department after 3 days of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower limb edema. His personal history is significant for a myocardial infarction 6 years ago that required revascularization and hypertension. His medication consists of simvastatin and lisinopril.  In the ED, he has a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a pulse of 88/min, a respiratory rate of 28/min, and a temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). On physical examination, he has jugular vein distention, displaced point of maximal impulse (PMI), an S4-gallop, a holosystolic murmur, and 2+ pitting edema up to the mid calf.  He is started on furosemide, carvedilol, and oxygen therapy. After 6-hours of continued therapy, his blood pressure remains low, and his serum creatinine is found to be 1.9 mg/dL. Which of the following test would be more useful to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease?
Options:
(A): Sulfosalicylic acid test
(B): Urine sodium content
(C): Fractional excretion of sodium Na+ (FENa+)
(D): Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea)
(E): Nitrates in urine
",Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea),Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea).

Explanation:
In this patient, the presentation of shortness of breath, orthopnea, lower limb edema, jugular vein distention, displaced PMI, S4-gallop, and holosystolic murmur suggests congestive heart failure (CHF) as the underlying cause of his symptoms. CHF can lead to prerenal kidney injury due to decreased renal perfusion. However, it is important to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease to guide appropriate management.

The fractional excretion of urea (FEUrea) is a useful test to differentiate between prerenal and intrinsic kidney disease. FEUrea is calculated using the following formula:

FEUrea = (urine urea nitrogen × plasma creatinine) / (plasma urea nitrogen × urine creatinine) × 100

In prerenal kidney injury, there is decreased renal perfusion, leading to increased reabsorption of urea in the proximal tubules. This results in a low FEUrea (<35%). In contrast, in intrinsic kidney disease, there is tubular damage, leading to impaired reabsorption of urea and a high FEUrea (>50%).

Therefore, in this patient with CHF and acute kidney injury, a high FEUrea would suggest intrinsic kidney disease as the cause of his renal dysfunction, while a low FEUrea would support the diagnosis of prerenal kidney injury due to decreased renal perfusion.",
"A 26-year-old Caucasian woman is admitted to the emergency department after 4 days of fever, malaise, vomiting, and nausea for which she has been taking ibuprofen and diclofenac. She has also noticed a decrease in urination. Her family and past medical history are unremarkable. Her temperature is 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure is 118/76 mm Hg, heart rate is 74/min, and respiratory rate is 15/min. Upon physical examination, her mucous membranes are moist and she has no abdominal tenderness. Four hours after admission, she has a urinary output < 0.3 mL/kg/h and laboratory tests significant for the following:

Which of the following skin manifestations would you also expect to find in this patient?
Options:
(A): Livedo reticularis
(B): Janeway lesions
(C): Diffuse maculopapular rash
(D): Malar rash
(E): Erythema nodosum
",Diffuse maculopapular rash,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Diffuse maculopapular rash.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, she is presenting with acute kidney injury (AKI) and likely acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). AIN is an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that can be caused by certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and diclofenac. 

In addition to the renal manifestations, AIN can also present with systemic symptoms and skin manifestations. One of the most common skin manifestations seen in AIN is a diffuse maculopapular rash. This rash is characterized by small, flat, and raised red spots on the skin that can be itchy or non-itchy. It typically involves the trunk and extremities and can spread to the face and neck. 

The other options listed are not typically associated with AIN. Livedo reticularis (option A) is a lace-like pattern of discoloration on the skin that is often seen in conditions such as vasculitis or antiphospholipid syndrome. Janeway lesions (option B) are painless, erythematous macules or papules that are seen in infective endocarditis. Malar rash (option D) is a characteristic rash seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. Erythema nodosum (option E) is a painful, red, subcutaneous nodule that is often seen in conditions such as sarcoidosis or infections. 

Therefore, the most likely skin manifestation in this patient with AIN would be a diffuse maculopapular rash (option C).",
"A 59-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic for worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure. She states that while she used to be able to go for short walks, she is no longer able to do so. Now, even simple tasks like getting ready in the morning have become burdensome for her. When she gets tired, sitting down helps to alleviate her symptoms. Her blood pressure is 136/92 mm Hg and heart rate is 76/min. On physical examination, she has regular heart sounds but does have 1+ pitting edema to her bilateral lower extremities. What is her New York Heart Association Functional Classification for congestive heart failure?
Options:
(A): New York Heart Association Class I
(B):  New York Heart Association Class IIa
(C): New York Heart Association Class IIb
(D): New York Heart Association Class III
(E): New York Heart Association Class IV
",New York Heart Association Class III,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) New York Heart Association Class III.

Explanation:
The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification for congestive heart failure is based on the degree of limitation of physical activity. 

Class I (Mild): No limitation of ordinary physical activity.
Class II (Mild): Mild dyspnea, fatigue, or palpitations with ordinary physical activity.
Class III (Moderate): Symptoms with less than ordinary physical activity.
Class IV (Severe): Symptoms present at rest.

In this case, the patient is experiencing worsening symptoms of congestive heart failure, with limitations in her physical activity. She is no longer able to go for short walks and even simple tasks have become burdensome for her. This indicates that her symptoms are present with less than ordinary physical activity, which corresponds to NYHA Class III.",
"A 36-year-old woman comes to the physician for intermittent stabbing face pain. The pain typically occurs in waves of several individual episodes lasting about one second. It is bilateral, but rarely occurs on both sides simultaneously. Touching her face or brushing her teeth can trigger an attack. Four months ago, she had an episode of weakness in her right arm that lasted for about a week. Family history is notable for migrainous headaches in her mother and brother. Vital signs are within normal limits. There is decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of her face bilaterally. Muscle strength is 3/5 in the left upper extremity and 5/5 in the right upper extremity. There is spasticity of the lower extremities with sustained clonus. Further evaluation is most likely going to reveal which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Gingival swelling, erythema, and pus drainage
(B): Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques
(C): Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution
(D): Photophobia and phonophobia
(E): Rhinorrhea, lacrimination, and ptosis
",Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques.

The patient's symptoms, including intermittent stabbing face pain triggered by touch, bilateral decreased sensation in the V2 and V3 distribution of the face, and weakness in the right arm, are suggestive of trigeminal neuralgia. Trigeminal neuralgia is commonly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), which is characterized by the presence of multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques on imaging studies.

Trigeminal neuralgia is a condition characterized by brief episodes of stabbing facial pain, typically in the territory of the second and third divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The pain is often triggered by touch or movement. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with trigeminal neuralgia, and further evaluation is likely to reveal multiple periventricular sclerotic plaques, which are indicative of MS.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms or are not associated with trigeminal neuralgia. Gingival swelling, erythema, and pus drainage (option A) are suggestive of periodontal disease or dental infection, which do not explain the patient's neurological symptoms. Erythematous papules in the V2/V3 nerve distribution (option C) are not characteristic of trigeminal neuralgia. Photophobia and phonophobia (option D) are associated with migraines, but the patient's symptoms are not consistent with migraines. Rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and ptosis (option E) are suggestive of Horner syndrome, which is not associated with trigeminal neuralgia.",
"A 23-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 28 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal examination. Her previous pregnancy was uncomplicated and she gave birth to a healthy boy. Her blood group is A, Rh-negative. The father's blood group is B, Rh-positive. Administration of which of the following is most appropriate at this time?
Options:
(A): Anti-A IgG
(B): Anti-D IgG
(C): Anti-B IgG
(D): Anti-D IgM
(E): Anti-A IgM
",Anti-D IgG,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Anti-D IgG.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the woman is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive. This puts the woman at risk for RhD alloimmunization, which can occur when Rh-negative individuals are exposed to Rh-positive blood. If the woman becomes sensitized to the Rh antigen, it can lead to hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) in subsequent pregnancies.

To prevent sensitization and the development of HDFN, administration of anti-D immunoglobulin (Anti-D IgG) is most appropriate. Anti-D IgG works by binding to any Rh-positive fetal red blood cells that may have entered the maternal circulation during pregnancy or delivery, preventing the mother's immune system from recognizing and producing antibodies against the Rh antigen.

It is recommended to administer Anti-D IgG to Rh-negative women at 28 weeks of gestation and within 72 hours after delivery of an Rh-positive baby. This helps to prevent sensitization and reduce the risk of HDFN in future pregnancies.",
"A 61-year-old man presents to the clinic with complaints of excessive thirst, frequent urination, and partial visual loss in both eyes for 1 day. His family history is significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus in his mother and cousin. His weight is 112 kg ( 246.9 lb), height 187 cm (6 ft 1 in), blood pressure: 150/90 mm Hg, heart rate: 89/min, respiratory rate: 14/min, and temperature: 36.7℃ (98.4℉). The physical examination is significant for dry skin, a pustular rash over the patient’s shoulders and back, an accentuated second heart sound (S2) best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border, and distal loss of vibration sensitivity in both feet. A fundoscopic examination shows small red dots in the superficial retinal layers suggestive of microaneurysms. The HbA1c is 9% and the urinalysis shows the following:
Color Pale yellow (light/pale-to-dark/deep amber)

Which of the following statements best describes the cause of this patient’s glucosuria?
Options:
(A): Yeasts metabolize glucogenic amino acids which are filtered in the urine into glucose
(B): There is a disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules
(C): Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules
(D): There is a disruption of passive transport of the glucose in the proximal renal tubules
(E): Glucosuria results from increased glomerular filtration rate
",Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Secondary active transporters fail to completely reabsorb glucose in the renal tubules.

Explanation:
Glucosuria refers to the presence of glucose in the urine. In a healthy individual, glucose is filtered by the glomerulus in the kidney, but almost all of it is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules through secondary active transporters. These transporters use the sodium gradient created by primary active transport to reabsorb glucose back into the bloodstream.

In this patient, the presence of glucosuria indicates that the secondary active transporters in the renal tubules are failing to completely reabsorb glucose. This is likely due to the high levels of glucose in the blood, as indicated by the elevated HbA1c and the presence of glucose in the urine. The high glucose levels overwhelm the reabsorptive capacity of the transporters, leading to the spillage of glucose into the urine.

Option (A) is incorrect because yeasts do not metabolize glucogenic amino acids into glucose in the urine. Option (B) is incorrect because there is no disruption of primary active transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules. Option (D) is incorrect because there is no disruption of passive transport of glucose in the proximal renal tubules. Option (E) is incorrect because glucosuria is not caused by an increased glomerular filtration rate.",
"A 65-year-old male presents to his primary care physician for stiffness in his arm. He states that he has been having trouble combing his hair and reaching objects that are high on the shelf. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and hypertension. His current medications include metformin, insulin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient admits to leading a sedentary life in which he tends to stay home and watch television. He does not engage in any physical or strenuous activity. On physical exam the patient has decreased passive and active range of motion of his shoulder. Strength of the patient's upper extremity is 4/5. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Rotator cuff impingement
(B): Adhesive capsulitis
(C): Biceps tendinopathy
(D): Glenohumeral osteoarthritis
(E): Subacromial bursitis
",Adhesive capsulitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Adhesive capsulitis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of stiffness in the arm and difficulty with activities such as combing hair and reaching high objects, along with decreased passive and active range of motion of the shoulder, the most likely diagnosis is adhesive capsulitis, also known as frozen shoulder.

Adhesive capsulitis is characterized by inflammation and thickening of the shoulder joint capsule, leading to pain and stiffness. It commonly affects individuals with diabetes mellitus type II, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle, which are all present in this patient's medical history. The decreased strength of the patient's upper extremity (4/5) is also consistent with adhesive capsulitis.

Rotator cuff impingement, biceps tendinopathy, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and subacromial bursitis are all possible differentials for shoulder pain and dysfunction, but they do not fully explain the combination of symptoms and findings in this patient.",
"A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic with a headache and dizziness for the past month. The patient reports that about 4 weeks ago he developed a “nagging” headache. He thought he had a cold, so he tried over the counter ibuprofen that provided only mild and temporary relief. Recently, he also started feeling dizzy and nauseous, which only resolves when he steps outside to shovel the snow. The patient’s medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma. His medications include amlodipine, metformin, glimepiride, and a fluticasone/salmeterol inhaler. The patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks but denies other recent travel. He denies smoking tobacco or illicit drug use. The patient’s temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 130/78 mmHg, pulse is 72/min, and respirations are 16/min with an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. The patient is currently asymptomatic while sitting in the office, and physical examination is unremarkable. Labs are drawn, as shown below:

Hemoglobin: 20 g/dL
Hematocrit: 60%
Leukocyte count: 10,050 cells/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 350,000/mm^3

Which of the following underlies the patient’s most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Medication side effect
(B): Myeloproliferative neoplasm
(C): Neuronal hyperexcitability
(D): Toxic exposure
(E): Viral infection
",Toxic exposure,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Toxic exposure.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of headache, dizziness, and nausea, which resolve when he steps outside, suggest a possible toxic exposure. The fact that the patient has been living at his upstate cabin for the past 5 weeks and denies other recent travel further supports this possibility. Additionally, the patient's medical history is significant for hypertension, type II diabetes mellitus, and asthma, which may increase his susceptibility to toxic exposures. 

The laboratory findings of an elevated hemoglobin (20 g/dL) and hematocrit (60%) are consistent with polycythemia, which can be caused by chronic hypoxia due to toxic exposure. The leukocyte count and platelet count are within normal limits, making myeloproliferative neoplasm less likely. Neuronal hyperexcitability and viral infection are less likely given the patient's symptoms and history. 

Therefore, toxic exposure is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. Further investigation and evaluation are necessary to identify the specific toxin and provide appropriate treatment.",
"A 20-year-old woman comes to the clinic for her first follow-up visit after being diagnosed with bipolar I disorder 1-month ago. At that time, she was acutely severely manic and was brought to the emergency department by her concerned boyfriend. She was started on lithium, and after subsequent improvement, she was discharged. A week after discharge, the patient forgot to take her medication for a few days and quickly began to manifest manic symptoms again which required brought her to the emergency department again. Since then, she has been compliant with her medications and currently has no significant complaints. Which of the following recommendations would be most helpful in minimizing the risk to the fetus in this patient?
Options:
(A): Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy
(B): Supplement all patients with 5mg of daily folic acid
(C): Low-dose polytherapy is preferred over monotherapy
(D): Discontinue the medication when conception is confirmed
(E): Switch to valproate as it has safest pregnancy profile
",Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Adjust dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy.

Explanation:
In pregnant patients treated with lithium, it is recommended to use the lowest amount necessary to achieve a therapeutic serum concentration. The total daily dose is often given in two to three divided doses using controlled-release preparations to avoid high peak serum levels. Serum lithium concentrations should be checked every two to four weeks during pregnancy until 36 weeks gestation, at which point levels should be checked weekly. Additional laboratory monitoring of lithium includes thyroid and renal function tests that are checked at baseline and repeated every three months.

Adjusting the dosage of medication throughout the pregnancy is important to maintain therapeutic levels while minimizing the risk to the fetus. This allows for close monitoring of the patient's symptoms and medication levels to ensure stability and minimize the risk of relapse. It is important to balance the need for medication to manage the bipolar disorder with the potential risks to the fetus.",
"A 19-year-old female presents to the emergency room with 6 days of lower abdominal pain. She states that her symptoms have progressed and she now feels feverish as well. She also notes an episode of nonbloody diarrhea 2 days ago and has been increasingly nauseous. While being evaluated in the emergency room, she vomits three times. The patient has no significant past medical history but was recently treated with ciprofloxacin for an uncomplicated urinary tract infection. She also notes irregular periods, with a last menstrual period 6 weeks ago. She is a college student who has had 3 sexual partners in the last year with inconsistent use of barrier protection. Her temperature is 100.5°C (38.1°F), blood pressure is 102/68 mmHg, pulse is 97/min, and respirations are 14/min. On exam, the patient is noticeably uncomfortable. There is marked tenderness to palpation in the suprapubic region and right lower quadrant, with voluntary guarding but no rebound. Pelvic exam shows moderate purulent discharge in the vaginal vault, cervical motion tenderness, and a tender adnexal mass on the right side. Which of the following is the best next step in treating this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline with outpatient follow-up
(B): Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission
(C): Oral vancomycin with outpatient follow-up
(D): Methotrexate with outpatient follow-up
(E): Exploratory laparotomy
",Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she is presenting with symptoms consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID is an infection of the upper genital tract, including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. It is commonly caused by sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea and chlamydia.

The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and purulent discharge, along with the physical examination findings of cervical motion tenderness and a tender adnexal mass, are highly suggestive of PID.

The best next step in treating this patient's condition is intravenous cefotetan and doxycycline with inpatient admission. This is the most appropriate choice because the patient's symptoms are severe, she has signs of systemic illness (fever, vomiting), and there is concern for possible tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) given the tender adnexal mass. Inpatient admission allows for close monitoring, intravenous antibiotics for more effective treatment, and the possibility of surgical intervention if necessary.

Option (A) of intramuscular ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline with outpatient follow-up is not the best choice because the patient's symptoms are severe and she has signs of systemic illness, indicating the need for inpatient treatment.

Option (C) of oral vancomycin with outpatient follow-up is not the best choice because vancomycin is not the appropriate treatment for PID. It is primarily used for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).

Option (D) of methotrexate with outpatient follow-up is not the best choice because methotrexate is used for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy, not PID. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with ectopic pregnancy.

Option (E) of exploratory laparotomy is not the best choice as the initial management for PID. Exploratory laparotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the abdomen to visualize and examine the pelvic organs. It is typically reserved for cases of severe PID with complications, such as TOA or abscess rupture, which may require surgical intervention. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest PID, but there is no indication for immediate surgical intervention.",
"A 72-year-old man with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of breathlessness and fatigue. His pulse is 100/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Further evaluation shows a systemic vascular resistance of 35 mm Hg × min/L with an end-systolic volume of 80 mL. Which of the following describes the ejection fraction in this patient?
Options:
(A): 30%
(B): 15%
(C): 35%
(D): 25%
(E): 20%
",20%,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) 20%.

Explanation:
Ejection fraction (EF) is calculated as stroke volume (end-diastolic volume [EDV] minus end-systolic volume [ESV]) divided by end-diastolic volume multiplied by 100%.

In this case, the end-systolic volume is given as 80 mL. However, the end-diastolic volume is not provided. Without the end-diastolic volume, we cannot calculate the ejection fraction accurately.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E) 20% because we do not have enough information to calculate the ejection fraction in this patient.",
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the office for evaluation of intermittent vertigo for the past 2 days. She complains of vomiting and complete hearing loss in her left ear. The patient believes she had an ear infection in the same ear but never sought out treatment. She has a past medical history of uterine fibroids. She takes mifepristone daily to reduce the size of the fibroids. Her blood pressure is 114/72 mm Hg, the heart rate is 68/min, the respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). The patient appears pale and in mild distress. Otoscopy reveals a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is observed to be immobile as confirmed by the pneumatoscope. Pure-tone audiometry testing reveals hearing loss across all frequencies in the left ear. Heart auscultation is without murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Nystagmus is positive to the right. MRI of the brain does not reveal a tumor or abscess. Her physician orders a complete blood count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, which show:
Hemoglobin 14.5 gm/dL
Hematocrit 43.2 %
White blood cells 14,500 /mm3
Platelets 312,000/mm3
Neutrophil 81.6%
Lymphocyte 15.2%
Monocyte 1.4%
Eosinophil 1.2%
Basophil 0.6%
Serum Na+ 138 mEq/L
K+ 4.3 mEq/L
Cl- 108 mmol/L
BUN 12 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL
Which of the following is the most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?
Options:
(A): Ofloxacin
(B): Cefepime
(C): Cefotaxime
(D): Amoxicillin
(E): Cephalexin
",Amoxicillin,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Amoxicillin.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and physical examination findings, she likely has acute otitis media with complications, specifically mastoiditis. Mastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid air cells, which are located in the mastoid process of the temporal bone. It can occur as a complication of acute otitis media when the infection spreads from the middle ear to the mastoid air cells.

The patient's symptoms of intermittent vertigo, vomiting, and complete hearing loss in the left ear, along with the physical examination findings of a suppurative, erythematous, bulging tympanic membrane and immobile tympanic membrane, are consistent with mastoiditis. The positive nystagmus to the right is also a characteristic finding in mastoiditis.

The most appropriate antibiotic choice for the treatment of mastoiditis is amoxicillin. Amoxicillin is a first-line agent for the treatment of acute otitis media, and it also covers the most common pathogens associated with mastoiditis, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. In addition, amoxicillin has good penetration into the middle ear and mastoid air cells.

Ofloxacin (A) is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has good activity against gram-negative organisms but is not typically used as a first-line agent for the treatment of mastoiditis. Cefepime (B) and cefotaxime (C) are both third-generation cephalosporins that have good activity against gram-negative organisms but do not cover the most common pathogens associated with mastoiditis. Cephalexin (E) is a first-generation cephalosporin that does not cover the most common pathogens associated with mastoiditis.",
"A 52-year-old woman presents to the emergency department due to severe pain of her first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint. This pain started acutely, and she describes the pain as sharp. Her medical history is significant for obesity, hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and extensive alcohol use. She takes a number of medications but does not remember what they are. On physical exam, her right first MTP joint appears warm, swollen, erythematous, and exquisitely painful to the touch. After resolution of this acute episode, the patient is started on a drug to prevent recurrence of the symptoms. One month later on follow-up, she is found to have pancytopenia. Which of the following describes the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case?
Options:
(A): Antibody to soluble factor
(B): Inhibitor of microtubule polymerization
(C): Inhibitor of proximal tubule reabsorption
(D): Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase
(E): Recombinant enzyme
",Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Inhibitor of xanthine oxidase.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute gout, which is characterized by sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, and erythema in the affected joint. The first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint is a common site for acute gout attacks. Risk factors for gout include obesity, hypertension, alcohol use, and certain medications.

The drug most likely prescribed in this case is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase is an enzyme involved in the metabolism of purines, which are precursors to uric acid. Inhibition of xanthine oxidase reduces the production of uric acid, thereby preventing the formation of urate crystals and subsequent inflammation in the joints.

One of the commonly used xanthine oxidase inhibitors is allopurinol. Allopurinol is metabolized to oxypurinol, which is a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. It is important to note that allopurinol can cause hypersensitivity reactions, including pancytopenia, which is a decrease in all three blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). This adverse effect is more common in patients with renal impairment, as allopurinol and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys.

Therefore, the mechanism of the drug most likely prescribed in this case is inhibition of xanthine oxidase, which reduces uric acid production and prevents recurrence of acute gout attacks. The subsequent development of pancytopenia is a known adverse effect of xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such as allopurinol.",
"A 59-year-old man complains of chest pain that has been present for 4 hours on the 5th day of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction. 5 days ago, he had a burning sensation in his chest and discomfort in his left shoulder. Upon initial presentation to the hospital’s emergency department, he was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and treated with alteplase. He has been under close observation since then. The patient now describes discomfort in his chest and left shoulder, somewhat similar in nature to what initially brought him into the hospital. A pulse of 86/min, respiratory rate of 16/min, and a blood pressure of 146/90 mm Hg are observed. Auscultation of the chest reveals no abnormal findings. The patient’s ECG is difficult to interpret. Of the following laboratory tests, an abnormal result of which would have the most diagnostic utility?
Options:
(A): Alanine aminotransferase
(B): Alkaline phosphatase
(C): Creatine kinase (CK-MB)
(D): Lactate dehydrogenase
(E): Troponin T
",Creatine kinase (CK-MB),Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Creatine kinase (CK-MB).

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is presenting with chest pain and discomfort in the left shoulder, which are symptoms consistent with a myocardial infarction. The patient had previously been diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction and was treated with alteplase. 

Creatine kinase (CK-MB) is an enzyme that is released into the bloodstream when there is damage to the heart muscle. It is a specific marker for myocardial infarction. Elevated levels of CK-MB indicate ongoing or recent damage to the heart muscle. 

In this case, an abnormal result of CK-MB would have the most diagnostic utility because it would confirm ongoing or recent damage to the heart muscle, indicating a possible recurrent myocardial infarction. This would require immediate medical intervention to prevent further damage and complications. 

The other laboratory tests listed (alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and troponin T) are not specific markers for myocardial infarction and would not provide as much diagnostic utility in this scenario.",
"A 16-year-old girl comes to the emergency department because of left wrist pain and swelling for 5 hours. She fell on an outstretched hand while playing basketball. She ignored it initially as she thought it was just a bruise, but the pain and swelling worsened throughout the day. The analgesic spray she used did not provide adequate relief. There is no family history of serious illness. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive pill. Her immunizations are up-to-date. She appears anxious. Her temperature is 37.1°C (99°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. Examination shows a swollen and tender left wrist; range of motion is limited. The anatomical snuffbox is tender to palpation. The grip strength of the left hand is decreased. The thumb can be opposed towards the other fingers. Finkelstein's test is negative. X-rays of the wrist shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Open reduction and internal fixation
(B): Corticosteroid injections
(C): Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks
(D): Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks
(E): Percutaneous pinning
""
",Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a scaphoid fracture. Scaphoid fractures typically occur from a fall onto an outstretched hand and present with tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox, limited range of motion, and decreased grip strength. X-rays may not show abnormalities immediately following the injury, so repeat x-rays in 2 weeks are necessary to confirm the diagnosis. 

Open reduction and internal fixation (A) is not indicated at this time as it is a more invasive treatment option and is typically reserved for displaced or unstable fractures. 

Corticosteroid injections (B) are not appropriate for the management of a scaphoid fracture. Corticosteroid injections are typically used for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, such as tendonitis or arthritis, and would not be effective for a fracture. 

Rest, ice, and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks (D) is not the most appropriate next step in management. While rest and ice may provide some symptomatic relief, repeat x-rays are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture. 

Percutaneous pinning (E) is not indicated at this time. Percutaneous pinning is typically reserved for more severe fractures or fractures that are not healing with conservative management. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next best step in management is to immobilize the wrist with a thumb spica cast and repeat x-rays in 2 weeks to confirm the diagnosis of a scaphoid fracture.",
"A 46-year-old man comes to the physician with a 1-week history of yellowish discoloration of his eyes, generalized fatigue, and pruritus. He was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 7 years ago. At the time of diagnosis, a pANCA test was also positive. Physical examination shows scleral icterus and multiple scratch marks on the trunk and extremities. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Serum studies show a total bilirubin concentration of 3.2 mg/dL, direct bilirubin concentration of 2.5 mg/dL, and alkaline phosphatase level of 450 U/L. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography shows focal areas of intrahepatic bile duct strictures alternating with areas of dilation. Histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis
(B): Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis
(C): Diffuse fibrosis with PAS-staining globules
(D): Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells
(E): Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes
",Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). PSC is a chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The histologic examination of a liver biopsy specimen in PSC typically shows periductal concentric scarring and fibrosis. This finding is characterized by the presence of dense, ""onion-skin"" concentric fibrosis surrounding the bile ducts. 

The other options are not consistent with the histologic findings seen in PSC. Periportal lymphocytic infiltration and piecemeal necrosis (option B) are more commonly seen in autoimmune hepatitis. Diffuse fibrosis with PAS-staining globules (option C) is seen in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Irregular ductal glands lined by atypical and pleomorphic cells (option D) are seen in cholangiocarcinoma. Ductopenia and fibrotic degeneration of periportal hepatocytes (option E) are seen in primary biliary cholangitis.",
"A 29-year-old woman presents to her primary care doctor with a lesion on her left labia. She first noticed the lesion 3 days ago. The patient describes the lesion as painful and swollen. She denies vaginal discharge. Her past medical history is notable for mild intermittent asthma, gout, and obesity. She uses an albuterol inhaler as needed and takes allopurinol. She has had 5 sexual partners in the past year and uses the pull-out method for contraception. She has a 10-pack-year smoking history and drinks 10-12 alcoholic beverages per week. On exam, she has an ulcerated, tender, and purulent ulcer on the left labia majora. The patient has mild unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. This patient's condition is most likely caused by which of the following pathogens?
Options:
(A): Klebsiella granulomatis
(B): Herpes simplex virus type 2
(C): Haemophilus ducreyi
(D): Gardnerella vaginalis
(E): Treponema pallidum
",Haemophilus ducreyi,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Haemophilus ducreyi.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of a painful and swollen ulcer on the labia majora, along with unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy, the most likely pathogen causing her condition is Haemophilus ducreyi. Haemophilus ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, which is a sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful genital ulcers and regional lymphadenopathy. The ulcer in chancroid is typically purulent and tender. This infection is more common in regions with high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, such as Africa and Southeast Asia. The patient's sexual history and the presence of multiple sexual partners also increase the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection. The other options listed, including Klebsiella granulomatis, Herpes simplex virus type 2, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Treponema pallidum, are not consistent with the clinical presentation described.",
"A 67-year-old man presents with feelings of nervousness and anxiety. He mentions that lately, he has been feeling increasingly restless and is unable to control feelings of nervousness pertaining to all his daily tasks. He noticed that these feelings were more prominent in the last 2 months but have been present on and off for the last year. On many occasions, his mind will be racing with thoughts that keep him up at night. During these moments, he finds his heart racing and feels light-headed and dizzy to the point of blacking out. He has also been experiencing back and neck pain with increased muscle tension in these areas. The patient reports no smoking or alcohol use but mentions that he had tried cocaine and heroin in his 20s and 30s. Which of the following would be the best course of treatment for this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Diazepam
(B): Zolpidem
(C): Ramelteon
(D): Buspirone
(E): Alprazolam
",Buspirone,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Buspirone.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of nervousness, anxiety, restlessness, racing thoughts, difficulty sleeping, and physical symptoms such as increased heart rate, dizziness, and muscle tension, it is likely that he is experiencing generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is a chronic condition characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry and anxiety about various aspects of life.

Buspirone is a medication commonly used to treat GAD. It is a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic that works by binding to serotonin and dopamine receptors in the brain, helping to reduce anxiety symptoms. Unlike benzodiazepines, buspirone does not cause sedation or dependence, making it a safer option for long-term use.

Diazepam (option A) is a benzodiazepine that is typically used for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. It can cause sedation and has a higher risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms.

Zolpidem (option B) is a sedative-hypnotic medication used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. It is not indicated for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Ramelteon (option C) is a melatonin receptor agonist used for the treatment of insomnia. It is not indicated for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

Alprazolam (option E) is a benzodiazepine commonly used for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, it has a higher risk of sedation, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms compared to buspirone.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient's symptoms would be buspirone (option D).",
"Two hours after undergoing open cholecystectomy for complicated cholecystitis, a 48-year-old woman develops dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea. She has systemic lupus erythematosus and hypertension. Prior to hospitalization, her medications included nifedipine and prednisolone. Her pulse is 112/min and blood pressure is 90/64 mm Hg. Examination shows central obesity. The abdomen is soft and non-tender, and the laparoscopic incisions have no discharge. Her serum cortisol and serum ACTH are decreased. Which of the following additional findings is most likely in this patient?
Options:
(A): Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis
(B): Hyperkalemia
(C): Hyperglycemia
(D): Hypernatremia
(E): Hyponatremia
",Hyponatremia,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Hyponatremia.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with symptoms of dizziness, lethargy, abdominal pain, and nausea, which are consistent with hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L and can be caused by various factors, including adrenal insufficiency.

In this case, the patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and is taking prednisolone, which is a glucocorticoid medication. Glucocorticoids can suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to adrenal insufficiency. The decreased serum cortisol and ACTH levels in this patient indicate adrenal insufficiency.

Adrenal insufficiency can result in hyponatremia due to the impaired ability of the adrenal glands to produce aldosterone, which is responsible for regulating sodium and water balance in the body. Without adequate aldosterone, there is increased excretion of sodium in the urine, leading to hyponatremia.

The other options are less likely in this patient. Normal anion gap metabolic acidosis (option A) is not typically associated with adrenal insufficiency. Hyperkalemia (option B) is also not commonly seen in adrenal insufficiency, as aldosterone deficiency leads to increased potassium excretion. Hyperglycemia (option C) is not a typical finding in adrenal insufficiency. Hypernatremia (option D) is unlikely in this patient, as the symptoms and history are more consistent with hyponatremia.",
"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 40 weeks of gestation is admitted to the hospital in active labor. The patient has attended many prenatal appointments and followed her physician's advice about screening for diseases, laboratory testing, diet, and exercise. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. She has no history of a serious illness. Her first child was delivered via normal vaginal delivery. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Cervical examination shows 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation. A cardiotocograph is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step in management?
Options:
(A): Amnioinfusion
(B): Induced vaginal delivery
(C): Reassurance
(D): Repositioning
(E): Urgent cesarean delivery
",Reassurance,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Reassurance.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is in active labor with 100% effacement and 10 cm dilation, indicating that she is ready to deliver. The cardiotocograph is a tool used to monitor the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during labor. Without any additional information about abnormalities in the fetal heart rate or contractions, the most appropriate initial step in management is reassurance.

Reassurance is the appropriate choice because the patient has had a normal pregnancy, no serious medical history, and her vital signs are within normal limits. This suggests that she is likely to have a successful vaginal delivery without any complications. Reassurance can help alleviate any anxiety or concerns the patient may have and provide support during the labor process.

Amnioinfusion (option A) is a procedure used to infuse fluid into the amniotic cavity during labor to relieve variable decelerations in the fetal heart rate caused by cord compression. However, there is no indication of variable decelerations in the scenario, so amnioinfusion is not necessary at this time.

Induced vaginal delivery (option B) is not necessary as the patient is already in active labor and progressing towards delivery.

Repositioning (option D) may be helpful in certain situations, such as if the patient is experiencing back pain or if there are concerns about fetal positioning. However, there is no indication in the scenario that repositioning is needed.

Urgent cesarean delivery (option E) is not indicated in this scenario as the patient is in active labor and progressing towards delivery without any complications. Cesarean delivery is typically reserved for situations where there are concerns about the safety of the mother or baby, such as fetal distress or failure to progress in labor.",
"A 63-year-old female complains of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue. She has a past medical history of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Her hematocrit is 29%. On peripheral blood smear, you notice neutrophils with 7 lobes and large oval-shaped red blood cells. On physical exam, you notice the patient has decreased position sense and a loss in vibratory sensation in her lower extremities. Which of the following is most likely present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Atrophy of G cells
(B): Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies
(C): Decreased methylmalonic acid levels
(D): Antithrombotic state
(E): B12 malabsorption due to Diphyllobothrium latum
",Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory results are consistent with pernicious anemia, which is caused by a deficiency of vitamin B12. Pernicious anemia is most commonly due to the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, which interfere with the absorption of vitamin B12 in the ileum. The patient's symptoms of weakness, light-headedness, palpitations, and soreness of the tongue are consistent with the anemia caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. The presence of large oval-shaped red blood cells (macrocytic anemia) on peripheral blood smear is also indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency. The decreased position sense and loss of vibratory sensation in the lower extremities are neurological manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency. Atrophy of the lingual papillae, as seen in this patient, is a characteristic finding in pernicious anemia and is known as atrophic glossitis. The neutrophils with 7 lobes seen on peripheral blood smear are called hypersegmented neutrophils and are also indicative of vitamin B12 deficiency. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms and findings is the presence of anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, leading to B12 malabsorption and pernicious anemia.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to the doctor’s office with shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue for 3 days. This has been progressively worsening. He has a medical history significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and osteoarthritis. He takes albuterol, ipratropium and aspirin. He smoked 2 and a half packs per day, and had done so for the past 26 years. After ceasing tobacco use for 1 year, he has recently begun smoking again. The blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 12/min, the heart rate is 76/min, and the pulse oximetry is 87% on room air. On physical examination, the patient appears disoriented and is only somewhat comprehensible. The pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light with extraocular movements intact. Cranial nerves VII-XII also intact. The auscultation of the heart is absent of murmur, rubs, or gallops. The auscultation of the lungs demonstrate audible rales in the bases bilaterally. Which of the stages of change is the patient currently experiencing based on the clinical vignette?
Options:
(A): Precontemplation
(B): Contemplation
(C): Preparation
(D): Maintenance
(E): Relapse
",Relapse,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Relapse.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical vignette, the patient had previously quit smoking for 1 year but has recently started smoking again. This indicates a relapse in his behavior. Relapse is a stage in the transtheoretical model of behavior change, which describes the process individuals go through when making a behavior change. The stages include precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. Relapse occurs when an individual reverts back to their previous behavior after a period of change.

In this case, the patient's history of smoking cessation for 1 year indicates that he had previously reached the maintenance stage, where he successfully maintained the behavior change of not smoking. However, his recent return to smoking indicates a relapse, as he has reverted back to his previous behavior of smoking.

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, along with the presence of audible rales in the lungs, suggest that his relapse into smoking has had negative effects on his respiratory health. This highlights the importance of maintaining behavior changes, such as smoking cessation, to prevent the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other respiratory complications.",
"A 28-year-old man reports to his physician that he is having second thoughts about his long-term compatibility with his wife ever since they relocated to a new city. He admits that he has noticed himself flirting with some of the female co-workers at his new workplace. When he goes on a dinner date with his wife after work one evening, he accuses her of giving their waiter flirtatious looks and asks her whether she has been cheating on him or trying to spend time with other men. The man’s actions are most consistent with which of the following psychological defense mechanisms?
Options:
(A): Displacement
(B): Dissociation
(C): Projection
(D): Reaction formation
(E): Repression
",Projection,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Projection.

Explanation:
Projection is a psychological defense mechanism in which an individual attributes their own unacceptable thoughts, feelings, or impulses onto someone else. In this case, the man is experiencing doubts about his own fidelity and compatibility with his wife. Instead of acknowledging these feelings within himself, he projects them onto his wife by accusing her of flirting with the waiter and being unfaithful. By doing so, he is displacing his own feelings onto her, making her the target of his insecurities and doubts.

Displacement, option (A), involves redirecting one's feelings or impulses from the original source to a substitute target. This defense mechanism is not applicable in this scenario as the man is not redirecting his feelings towards someone else, but rather projecting them onto his wife.

Dissociation, option (B), is a defense mechanism characterized by a detachment from one's thoughts, feelings, or memories. This is not evident in the man's behavior as he is actively engaging with his thoughts and accusing his wife.

Reaction formation, option (D), is a defense mechanism in which an individual expresses the opposite of their true feelings or impulses. This is not applicable in this scenario as the man's accusations towards his wife align with his doubts and insecurities, rather than being the opposite.

Repression, option (E), involves unconsciously blocking or suppressing unwanted thoughts or memories. While the man may be experiencing some level of repression regarding his own doubts and insecurities, his behavior of accusing his wife is more indicative of projection rather than repression.",
"A 25-year-old, G2P2L2 woman presents with a complaint of missed menstrual cycle for 4 weeks. Her previous menstrual cycles were regular, occurring every 28–35 days consistently. The patient does not have any other complaints currently. Her past medical history reveals two uncomplicated and normal vaginal deliveries at term. She has a 2-year-old boy and a 6-month-old girl. The patient and her partner use the withdrawal method for contraception. The urine pregnancy test result is positive. The patient returns to the clinic after 1 week expressing her desire to discontinue with the pregnancy and inquires about the possibility of an elective abortion. Which of the following procedures is the most appropriate for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient?
Options:
(A): Dilatation and evacuation (D&E)
(B): Oxytocin-induced labor
(C): Manual uterine aspiration
(D): Dilatation and curettage (D & C) after vacuum evacuation
(E): Oral mifepristone + misoprostol
",Oral mifepristone + misoprostol,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Oral mifepristone + misoprostol.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient desires elective termination of pregnancy. The most appropriate procedure for elective termination of pregnancy in this patient is oral mifepristone + misoprostol. This combination is commonly used for medical abortion in the first trimester. Mifepristone is a progesterone receptor antagonist that causes the detachment of the embryo from the uterine wall. Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analog that induces uterine contractions and expulsion of the embryo. This combination is effective and safe for terminating pregnancies up to 10 weeks gestation. It is a non-invasive procedure that can be done in an outpatient setting, and it allows the patient to have more control over the timing and process of the abortion.",
"A 77-year-old man comes to your office for a routine visit. He is doing well, and his only complaint is the recent appearance of several brown greasy appearing lesions on his forehead (figure A) that he can't seem to peel off. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Melanoma
(B): Seborrheic keratosis
(C): Keloid
(D): Acanthosis nigricans
(E): Erythema nodosum
",Seborrheic keratosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Seborrheic keratosis.

Explanation:
Seborrheic keratosis is a common benign skin condition that typically affects older individuals. It is characterized by the development of brown, greasy appearing lesions on the skin. These lesions are usually raised and have a waxy or stuck-on appearance. They can vary in size and shape, and may be flat or slightly elevated. Seborrheic keratosis lesions are typically painless and do not cause any symptoms, although they can sometimes be itchy.

Melanoma, on the other hand, is a type of skin cancer that can also present as brown or black lesions on the skin. However, melanoma lesions are usually asymmetrical, have irregular borders, and may change in size, shape, or color over time. They can also be associated with other symptoms such as itching, bleeding, or ulceration.

Keloids are raised scars that occur as a result of an overgrowth of scar tissue. They typically develop after a skin injury or surgery, and are more common in individuals with darker skin types. Keloids are usually firm, rubbery, and can be larger than the original wound.

Acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by dark, thickened patches of skin. It is often associated with insulin resistance and can be a sign of underlying conditions such as diabetes or obesity. Acanthosis nigricans typically affects areas of the body with folds or creases, such as the neck, armpits, and groin.

Erythema nodosum is a type of skin inflammation that presents as tender, red nodules on the legs. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as infections, autoimmune diseases, or medications.

Given the patient's age, the appearance of the lesions, and the absence of any other symptoms, the most likely diagnosis in this case is seborrheic keratosis. However, it is important to conduct a thorough examination and consider other factors before making a definitive diagnosis.",
"A 72-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with a 6-month history of shortness of breath. He says that he used to enjoy playing golf with his friends but now he cannot walk for long enough to play. The shortness of breath is now starting to complicate his ability to get around in daily life. His past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, and early stage prostate cancer that was removed 10 years ago without recurrence. He has smoked 1 pack per day for the past 55 years and drinks about 6 drinks per week. On presentation he is found to be breathing with pursed lips. Physical exam reveals decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion. Which of the following findings would most likely be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Decreased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
(B): Decreased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
(C): Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
(D): Increased residual volume and increased 1 second forced expiratory volume
(E): Normal residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume
",Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume.

Explanation:
The patient's history of shortness of breath, decreased breath sounds on auscultation, increased chest diameter, and hyperresonance to percussion are all consistent with the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive lung disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. 

In COPD, there is air trapping and hyperinflation of the lungs, leading to increased residual volume. This is due to the loss of elastic recoil in the lungs, which makes it difficult for the patient to exhale fully. The increased residual volume causes the chest to become hyperexpanded and the diaphragm to flatten, leading to the increased chest diameter seen on physical exam.

The decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume (FEV1) is another characteristic finding in COPD. FEV1 is a measure of the amount of air that can be forcefully exhaled in one second. In COPD, the airways become narrowed and obstructed, making it difficult for air to flow out of the lungs. This results in a decreased FEV1.

Therefore, the combination of increased residual volume and decreased 1 second forced expiratory volume is most likely to be seen in this patient with COPD.",
"A 67-year-old male comes into the ED complaining of dyspnea and a heavy feeling in his chest. He reports that over the past month he has become more easily “winded"" to the point that he now sleeps in his living room because he can’t make it up the stairs. A review of systems is notable for headaches and fatigue. On physical exam you note decreased breath sounds and a dullness to percussion on the right. A chest radiograph is obtained, which shows a right-sided pleural effusion. Thoracocentesis is performed and the fluid is analyzed, with results shown below:

Volume: 30 cc of fluid
Pleural fluid protein: 5.8 g/dL
Serum protein ratio: 7.0 g/dL
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 258 U/L

Which of the following conditions may have led to the findings in this patient’s pleural cavity?
Options:
(A): Congestive heart failure
(B): Hypoalbuminemia
(C): Liver cirrhosis
(D): Lymphoma
(E): Nephrotic syndrome
",Lymphoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Lymphoma.

The findings in this patient's pleural cavity, including the right-sided pleural effusion, decreased breath sounds, and dullness to percussion, are consistent with a malignant cause. The pleural fluid analysis supports this suspicion. In lymphoma, the pleural fluid protein is typically elevated, as seen in this patient (5.8 g/dL). Additionally, the serum protein ratio is usually greater than 0.5, as seen in this patient (7.0 g/dL). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels can also be elevated in lymphoma, as seen in this patient (258 U/L).

Congestive heart failure (A) can cause pleural effusion, but the pleural fluid analysis in this patient does not support this diagnosis. In congestive heart failure, the pleural fluid protein is typically less than 0.5 g/dL and the serum protein ratio is usually less than 0.5.

Hypoalbuminemia (B) can lead to pleural effusion, but the pleural fluid analysis in this patient does not support this diagnosis. In hypoalbuminemia, the pleural fluid protein is typically less than 0.5 g/dL and the serum protein ratio is usually less than 0.5.

Liver cirrhosis (C) can cause pleural effusion, but the pleural fluid analysis in this patient does not support this diagnosis. In liver cirrhosis, the pleural fluid protein is typically less than 0.5 g/dL and the serum protein ratio is usually less than 0.5.

Nephrotic syndrome (E) can lead to pleural effusion, but the pleural fluid analysis in this patient does not support this diagnosis. In nephrotic syndrome, the pleural fluid protein is typically less than 0.5 g/dL and the serum protein ratio is usually less than 0.5.

Therefore, based on the pleural fluid analysis and the clinical presentation, lymphoma is the most likely condition that has led to the findings in this patient's pleural cavity.",
"A 29-year-old G4P0 woman presents following a spontaneous pregnancy loss in the 18th week of her pregnancy. This is her fourth loss in the second trimester and she is concerned about her inability to have a successful pregnancy. She is otherwise healthy and has no acute complaints. Her vitals are unremarkable and exam is notable only for a firm, asymmetric uterus. Laboratory studies are ordered as seen below.

Hemoglobin: 9.0 g/dL
Hematocrit: 30%
Leukocyte count: 6,800/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 199,000/mm^3

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL

Which of the following tests is most likely to elucidate the cause of this patient's pregnancy losses?
Options:
(A): Anti-cardiolipin antibodies
(B): Karotyping
(C): Hysterosalpingogram
(D): Prolactin level
(E): TSH level
",Hysterosalpingogram,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Hysterosalpingogram.

Explanation:
This patient's history of multiple pregnancy losses in the second trimester suggests a possible underlying anatomical abnormality. The finding of a firm, asymmetric uterus on examination further supports this suspicion. A hysterosalpingogram is a radiographic procedure that involves injecting contrast dye into the uterus and fallopian tubes to evaluate their structure and patency. It can help identify abnormalities such as uterine septum, adhesions, or tubal blockage that may be contributing to the recurrent pregnancy losses. 

Option (A) Anti-cardiolipin antibodies is a test used to evaluate for antiphospholipid syndrome, which is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss. However, this test is typically ordered in patients with a history of recurrent early pregnancy losses, rather than losses in the second trimester.

Option (B) Karyotyping is a genetic test that can identify chromosomal abnormalities, which can be a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss. However, karyotyping is more commonly performed in cases of recurrent early pregnancy losses, rather than losses in the second trimester.

Option (D) Prolactin level is a test used to evaluate for hyperprolactinemia, which can interfere with ovulation and fertility. However, this test is not likely to elucidate the cause of the patient's second trimester pregnancy losses.

Option (E) TSH level is a test used to evaluate thyroid function. Thyroid dysfunction can be associated with infertility and pregnancy loss. However, in this patient's case, the TSH level is not likely to be the primary cause of her recurrent second trimester losses, as her TSH level is within the normal range.",
"A 22-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician in April for seasonal allergies. She has suffered from seasonal allergies for the past 2 years and takes diphenhydramine as needed when her symptoms worsen. She has not yet seen a physician for her allergies. She reports that diphenhydramine has been helpful in controlling her symptoms, but she does not like feeling drowsy from the medication. Her past medical history is also notable for well-controlled asthma. She uses an albuterol inhaler on an as-needed basis. She smokes marijuana daily. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 16/min. She has a prominent nasal crease. Her nasal turbinates are boggy and bluish-gray. She has copious thin and watery nasal mucus. The physician suggests replacing diphenhydramine with fexofenadine to improve her drowsiness. What characteristic of fexodenadine allows it to be less sedating than diphenhydramine?
Options:
(A): Alpha-adrenergic antagonism
(B): Beta-adrenergic antagonism
(C): Muscarinic antagonism
(D): Relative lipophobicity
(E): Serotonergic antagonism
",Relative lipophobicity,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Relative lipophobicity.

Explanation:
Fexofenadine is less sedating than diphenhydramine due to its relative lipophobicity. Lipophobicity refers to the inability of a substance to dissolve in lipids or fats. Diphenhydramine, being lipophilic, has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and bind to central nervous system (CNS) receptors, leading to sedation. On the other hand, fexofenadine is lipophobic, meaning it does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and has minimal binding to CNS receptors. This results in reduced sedation and drowsiness compared to diphenhydramine.",
"A 55-year-old male visited his primary care physician complaining of chest pain and progressive shortness of breath worsened by exertion. His vital signs were within normal limits. He reports that he worked in a naval shipyard for 10 years during his twenties. A CT scan of his chest shows diffuse thickening of the pleura and a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made. Assuming this diagnosis is correct, which of the following is most likely to also be present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Pneumothorax
(B): Pleural effusion
(C): Systemic inflammatory response syndrome
(D): Bronchioalveolar carcinoma
(E): Bronchiectasis
",Pleural effusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Pleural effusion.

Explanation:
Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that affects the mesothelial cells, which are the cells that line the pleura (the thin membrane that covers the lungs and lines the chest cavity). In this case, the CT scan shows diffuse thickening of the pleura, which is a characteristic finding in mesothelioma.

Pleural effusion is the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space, which is the space between the layers of the pleura. It is a common finding in mesothelioma due to the inflammation and increased production of fluid by the cancer cells. The accumulation of fluid can cause chest pain and progressive shortness of breath, which are symptoms reported by the patient.

Pneumothorax is the presence of air in the pleural space, which can cause sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. However, it is not typically associated with mesothelioma.

Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is a severe inflammatory response that can occur in response to various conditions, such as infection or trauma. While mesothelioma can cause inflammation, it is not typically associated with SIRS.

Bronchioalveolar carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that arises from the bronchioles and alveoli. It is not directly related to mesothelioma.

Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by the permanent dilation of the bronchi, which can lead to chronic cough, sputum production, and recurrent respiratory infections. It is not directly related to mesothelioma.

Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient with mesothelioma is pleural effusion.",
"A 56-year-old man recently diagnosed with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol use presents to the clinic for a follow up evaluation. He states that he has abstained from alcohol and attends a support group regularly. He has not taken any new medications or encountered any sick contacts. The patient's blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 15/min. His physical exam is grossly unremarkable. He has brought an gastroduodenoscopy report for review, which reveals that the patient has small esophageal varices with red spots. What is the next best step to prevent bleeding?
Options:
(A): Endoscopic sclerotherapy
(B): Ligation
(C): Metoprolol
(D): Nadolol
(E): Repeat endoscopy
",Nadolol,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Nadolol.

Explanation:
In patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices, the next best step to prevent bleeding is the initiation of nonselective beta blockers, such as nadolol or propranolol. These medications have been shown to reduce the risk of variceal bleeding by decreasing portal pressure. The use of beta blockers is recommended in patients with medium or large varices, as well as in patients with high-risk small varices (such as those with red spots or in patients with Child class C cirrhosis). Endoscopic sclerotherapy and ligation are treatment options for active variceal bleeding, but they are not indicated for primary prevention. Metoprolol is a beta blocker, but it is not the preferred choice for variceal prophylaxis. Repeat endoscopy is not necessary at this time, as the patient's gastroduodenoscopy report already confirms the presence of small esophageal varices.",
"A 70-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife for incomprehensible speech. Upon first inspection you note the man is drooling and his eyes are tearing excessively. The patient's wife explains that the man was tilling the fields on the family beet farm when she found him collapsed on a pile of freshly picked beets. The patient seemed confused so the wife brought him in promptly, and states it has only been ten minutes since the patient was found down in the fields. Physical exam is deferred due to a confused and combative patient who is speaking clearly yet his sentences do not make any sense. The patients clothes are removed in the ED. Vital signs are currently being obtained. Which of the following is the best initial step in management?
Options:
(A): Sublingual atropine drops
(B): Neostigmine
(C): Physostigmine
(D): 2-pralidoxime
(E): Intubation
",2-pralidoxime,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) 2-pralidoxime.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and history of exposure to beets, it is likely that he is experiencing organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphates are commonly used as pesticides in agriculture, and exposure can lead to cholinergic excess symptoms such as excessive salivation, lacrimation, and confusion.

The best initial step in management is to administer 2-pralidoxime. Pralidoxime is an antidote that works by reactivating acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down acetylcholine. By reactivating acetylcholinesterase, pralidoxime helps to reverse the effects of organophosphate poisoning.

Atropine is also used in the treatment of organophosphate poisoning, as it helps to block the effects of excessive acetylcholine. However, in this case, 2-pralidoxime is the best initial step because it directly targets the underlying cause of the poisoning.

Neostigmine and physostigmine are not appropriate choices for the initial management of organophosphate poisoning. These medications are cholinesterase inhibitors and would exacerbate the symptoms of cholinergic excess.

Intubation may be necessary if the patient's airway becomes compromised, but it is not the best initial step in management. The priority is to administer the appropriate antidote, 2-pralidoxime, to reverse the effects of organophosphate poisoning.",
"A 75-year-old man presents to the physician for his annual blood pressure visit and blood work. He has no complaints other than occasional knee pain. The past medical history includes hypertension. He has had knee osteoarthritis for several years and takes occasional acetaminophen for pain control. His diet is full of vegetables. He exercises every day. He has no history of smoking. He had a brother who died at the age of 84 due to hematologic malignancy. The temperature is 36.8℃ (98.2℉), and the blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg. The physical examination shows no abnormalities other than a reduced range of motion and crepitus in both knees. The laboratory test results are as follows:
Hemoglobin 15 g/dL
Leukocyte count 58,000/mm3
Platelet count 250,000/mm3
Flow cytometry on the peripheral blood reveals an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)
(B): Monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis (MBL)
(C): Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)
(D): Multiple myeloma (MM)
(E): Polycythemia vera (PV)
",Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

Explanation:
The patient's laboratory results show an elevated leukocyte count of 58,000/mm3, with an absolute lymphocyte count of 50,000/mm3. This is consistent with a lymphoproliferative disorder. CLL is the most likely diagnosis in this case because it is the most common leukemia in adults, especially in older individuals. It is characterized by the accumulation of mature-appearing lymphocytes in the blood, bone marrow, and lymphoid tissues. The patient's age, elevated lymphocyte count, and family history of hematologic malignancy further support the diagnosis of CLL. The other options, MBL, MGUS, MM, and PV, are less likely based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings. MBL is a precursor condition to CLL, but it is typically asymptomatic and does not require treatment. MGUS is characterized by the presence of a monoclonal protein in the blood, which is not seen in this patient. MM is a plasma cell neoplasm that typically presents with bone pain, anemia, and renal insufficiency, which are not present in this patient. PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an elevated red blood cell mass, which is not seen in this patient.",
"A 60-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of cough productive of yellow sputum with occasional streaks of blood. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis. He is afebrile. Pulmonary examination shows inspiratory crackles at the left infraclavicular area. An x-ray of his chest shows a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning. A sputum sample does not grow acid-fast bacteria despite multiple cultures. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Hypersensitivity reaction
(B): Asbestos inhalation
(C): Neoplastic transformation
(D): Opportunistic colonization
(E): Abscess formation
",Opportunistic colonization,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Opportunistic colonization.

Explanation:
This patient's history of pulmonary tuberculosis and the presence of a radiopaque mass in the left upper lung lobe that shifts upon repositioning suggest the possibility of a mycetoma, also known as a fungal ball. A mycetoma is a mass composed of fungal hyphae that colonizes a preexisting lung cavity, such as a tuberculous cavity. It typically presents with chronic cough, sputum production, and occasional hemoptysis. The absence of acid-fast bacteria in the sputum despite multiple cultures suggests that the patient's symptoms are not due to active tuberculosis infection. Instead, the radiopaque mass and the lack of bacterial growth are consistent with opportunistic colonization by a fungus.",
"An 11-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother after she observed jerking movements of his arms and legs for about 30 seconds earlier that morning. He has not had fever, cough, or a runny nose. He has been healthy, except for occasional eczema. He was delivered at home in Romania. His mother had no prenatal care. She reports that he has required more time to reach developmental milestones compared to his older brother. The patient's immunization records are not available. He takes no medications. He appears pale with blue eyes and has a musty odor. He has poor eye contact. Which of the following would have most likely prevented the patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy
(B): Dietary restriction of phenylalanine
(C): Daily allopurinol intake
(D): Avoidance of fasting states
(E): High doses of vitamin B6
",Dietary restriction of phenylalanine,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Dietary restriction of phenylalanine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including jerking movements, delayed developmental milestones, pale appearance, blue eyes, musty odor, and poor eye contact, are consistent with a diagnosis of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine. Without this enzyme, phenylalanine accumulates in the body and can lead to neurologic damage.

Dietary restriction of phenylalanine is the mainstay of treatment for PKU. This involves avoiding foods that are high in phenylalanine, such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and beans. Instead, the patient would need to consume a special formula that is low in phenylalanine and provides the necessary nutrients for growth and development. This dietary restriction should have been implemented from birth to prevent the symptoms seen in this patient.

Levothyroxine therapy during pregnancy (choice A) is used to treat hypothyroidism in pregnant women and would not prevent the symptoms of PKU in the child.

Daily allopurinol intake (choice C) is used to treat conditions such as gout and would not prevent the symptoms of PKU.

Avoidance of fasting states (choice D) is important in the management of certain metabolic disorders, but it would not prevent the symptoms of PKU.

High doses of vitamin B6 (choice E) are not indicated in the treatment or prevention of PKU.

Therefore, the most likely intervention that would have prevented the patient's symptoms is dietary restriction of phenylalanine (choice B).",
"A researcher hypothesizes that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life. He conducts a study with a 95% confidence interval with a p-value of 0.049 to disprove his null hypothesis. He rejects his null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. Which of the following statements best associates with his study?
Options:
(A): Confidence interval should have been 90%.
(B): A type 2 error is not possible in this case.
(C): Null hypothesis should not have been rejected.
(D): A type 2 error has been made.
(E): A type 1 error has been made.
",A type 2 error is not possible in this case.,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): A type 2 error is not possible in this case.

Explanation:
In hypothesis testing, a type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is actually true. A type 2 error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is actually false. 

In this case, the researcher rejects the null hypothesis and concludes that low birth weight is associated with obesity. This means that the researcher has found evidence to support the alternative hypothesis, which suggests a relationship between low birth weight and obesity. Therefore, a type 2 error, which would involve failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is false, is not possible in this case.

The researcher's study has provided evidence to support the hypothesis that low birth weight is related to obesity later in life.",
"A 52-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient states that she has been experiencing watery diarrhea for weeks now. During this same period she states she has been constantly thirsty and does not have the same energy levels that she once had. The patient has a past medical history of anxiety and depression and is currently taking fluoxetine. She was recently treated for a middle ear infection and sinusitis with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid one week ago. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are obtained and shown below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 2.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 27 mEq/L
BUN: 25 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.4 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
AST: 12 U/L
ALT: 10 U/L

Which of the following is associated with the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Enterotoxin
(B): Impaired iron absorption
(C): Increased serotonin production
(D): Invasive bacterial infection
(E): Normal flora destruction
",Impaired iron absorption,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Impaired iron absorption.

The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, constant thirst, and decreased energy levels are suggestive of a malabsorption syndrome. The laboratory values show a low potassium level (2.9 mEq/L), which is consistent with diarrhea-induced hypokalemia. Additionally, the patient's history of recent antibiotic use (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) raises suspicion for antibiotic-associated diarrhea.

Impaired iron absorption is associated with malabsorption syndromes, such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease. These conditions can lead to chronic diarrhea and nutrient deficiencies, including iron deficiency. Iron is primarily absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, and any damage or inflammation in these areas can impair iron absorption.

The other options are less likely to be associated with the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings. Enterotoxin production is more commonly seen in bacterial infections, but the patient's symptoms are chronic rather than acute. Increased serotonin production is not typically associated with diarrhea and would not explain the patient's other symptoms. Invasive bacterial infection would typically present with more severe symptoms, such as high fever and systemic signs of infection. Normal flora destruction is not a specific diagnosis and does not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.",
"A 3-week-old newborn is brought to the physician by his parents because of poor feeding, irritability, and frequent vomiting over the past week. The vomitus is greenish in color and smells strange. His parents have tried to feed him every 4 hours, but the patient often spits up or refuses to eat. The patient was born at term and had his first bowel movement at 50 hours of life. He has since had one bowel movement daily. He is at the 50th percentile for length, 10th percentile for weight, and 40th percentile for head circumference. He does not appear to be in acute distress. His temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 140/min, respirations are 40/min, and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Physical examination shows that the patient has small, low-set ears, a broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally. The abdomen is distended. When the finger is removed following a rectal exam, there is an explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum. An x-ray of the abdomen shows a section of dilated colon followed by a segment of colon without stool or air. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): CT scan of the abdomen
(B): Transabdominal ultrasonography
(C): Barium enema
(D): Anorectal manometry
(E): Rectal suction biopsy
",Rectal suction biopsy,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Rectal suction biopsy.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease is a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal colon, resulting in functional obstruction. The absence of ganglion cells leads to a lack of peristalsis in the affected segment of the colon, causing a buildup of stool and subsequent distention of the colon proximal to the affected segment.

The clinical presentation of poor feeding, irritability, frequent vomiting, and distended abdomen, along with the physical examination findings of small, low-set ears, broad and flat nasal bridge, and a large space between the first and second toes bilaterally, are consistent with Hirschsprung disease. These physical findings are associated with Down syndrome, which is commonly seen in patients with Hirschsprung disease.

The explosive release of stool from the patient's rectum following a rectal exam is a classic finding in Hirschsprung disease. This is known as the ""squirt sign"" and occurs because the rectum is filled with stool due to the functional obstruction.

To confirm the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease, a rectal suction biopsy is the most appropriate test. This involves obtaining a small tissue sample from the rectal mucosa and examining it histologically for the absence of ganglion cells. The absence of ganglion cells in the biopsy confirms the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease.

The other options are not appropriate for confirming the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease. A CT scan of the abdomen may show signs of bowel obstruction but cannot definitively diagnose Hirschsprung disease. Transabdominal ultrasonography is not specific for Hirschsprung disease and may not provide enough information to confirm the diagnosis. Anorectal manometry is used to assess the function of the anal sphincter and is not specific for Hirschsprung disease. Barium enema can show the transition zone between the dilated and non-dilated segments of the colon, but it is not as accurate as rectal suction biopsy for confirming the diagnosis.",
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of progressive left leg pain for 2 months, which has started to interfere with his sleep. His mother has been giving him ibuprofen at night for “growing pains,” but his symptoms have not improved. One week before the pain started, the patient was hit in the thigh by a baseball, which caused his leg to become red and swollen for several days. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows marked tenderness along the left mid-femur. His gait is normal. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 21,000/mm3 and an ESR of 68 mm/h. An x-ray of the left lower extremity shows multiple lytic lesions in the middle third of the femur, and the surrounding cortex is covered by several layers of new bone. A biopsy of the left femur shows small round blue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Osteosarcoma
(B): Chondrosarcoma
(C): Osteochondroma
(D): Ewing sarcoma
(E): Osteoid osteoma
",Ewing sarcoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Ewing sarcoma.

Explanation:
Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that primarily affects children and young adults. It commonly presents with bone pain, often worse at night, and can be associated with a history of trauma, as seen in this case with the patient being hit by a baseball. The pain is typically localized and may be accompanied by swelling and tenderness. The presence of multiple lytic lesions on x-ray, along with the surrounding cortex being covered by several layers of new bone, is characteristic of Ewing sarcoma. 

Laboratory studies may show an elevated leukocyte count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), as seen in this patient. A biopsy of the affected bone typically shows small round blue cells, which is a characteristic finding in Ewing sarcoma.

Osteosarcoma (A) is another malignant bone tumor that primarily affects adolescents and young adults, but it typically presents with a solitary lesion and is not associated with the characteristic small round blue cells seen in Ewing sarcoma.

Chondrosarcoma (B) is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage and is more commonly seen in older adults. It typically presents with pain and swelling, but the presence of multiple lytic lesions and small round blue cells seen in this case are not consistent with chondrosarcoma.

Osteochondroma (C) is a benign bone tumor that typically presents as a painless mass and is not associated with the characteristic small round blue cells seen in Ewing sarcoma.

Osteoid osteoma (E) is a benign bone tumor that typically presents with localized pain that is worse at night and is relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The presence of multiple lytic lesions and the characteristic small round blue cells seen in this case are not consistent with osteoid osteoma.",
"A 55-year-old male with a history of stage I colon cancer status-post left hemicolectomy presents to your office for follow-up. You intend to discuss the results from his recent surveillance colonoscopy, which showed no remaining cancer, no polyps, and a well-healed anastmosis. During your meeting, you note that the patient is exhibiting the defense mechanism of suppression. Which of the following statements from the patient is consistent with your impression?
Options:
(A): ""Last week I volunteered for the local Cancer Society. Helping other cancer patients just makes me feel better.""
(B): ""Oh, doctor, I'm just so grateful to be seeing you. I just know you've cured my cancer. I probably don't even need to check anymore.""
(C): ""I'm sorry I was late today. I also didn't get any of the labs you asked for.""
(D): ""Ever since I had the colonoscopy, I've been having headaches and backaches and just pain all over! I'm sure it's from the cancer.""
(E): ""I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.""
","""I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.""",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): ""I really haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today. Worrying before getting the results wasn't going to help anything.""

Explanation:
Suppression is a defense mechanism in which a person consciously avoids thinking about or acknowledging a stressful or anxiety-provoking situation. In this case, the patient is exhibiting suppression by stating that they haven't thought about the colonoscopy until today and that worrying before getting the results wouldn't have helped anything. This statement suggests that the patient has been consciously avoiding thinking about or worrying about the results of the colonoscopy, which is consistent with the defense mechanism of suppression.",
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with severe, crushing, retrosternal chest pain for the last 45 minutes. The pain radiates to his left shoulder and is associated with sweating. The past medical history is significant for hypercholesterolemia, for which he takes lovastatin. He smoked as a youth but quit at 40 years of age. On arrival at the emergency department, the vital signs were as follows: pulse 58/min, respiratory rate 22/min, and blood pressure 90/56 mm Hg. He is sweating profusely. The jugular venous pulse is visible 2.5 cm above the sternal angle. Auscultation reveals soft S1 and S2 heart sounds with an added S4 and bilateral inspiratory crackles at the lung bases. The electrocardiogram shows ST-elevations in leads V1 and V2. A diagnosis of an anteroseptal infarction is made. The patient was given aspirin on the way to the hospital. He is started on dopamine, morphine, nitroglycerin, and streptokinase. Which of the following would be the most concerning development over the next 24h this patient?
Options:
(A): Hemoptysis
(B): Easy fatigability
(C): Persistent ST-segment elevation
(D): Persistent inspiratory crackles
(E): Shortness of breath
",Hemoptysis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Hemoptysis.

Explanation:
Hemoptysis refers to the coughing up of blood or blood-stained sputum from the respiratory tract. In the context of this patient with an anteroseptal infarction, the most concerning development over the next 24 hours would be the presence of hemoptysis. 

Hemoptysis can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, such as pulmonary embolism or rupture of a pulmonary artery aneurysm. In the case of this patient, the presence of hemoptysis could indicate the development of a complication related to the anteroseptal infarction, such as pulmonary embolism due to a clot formation or rupture of a pulmonary artery due to increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation.

Given the patient's history of hypercholesterolemia, smoking history, and the presence of ST-elevations on the electrocardiogram, it is likely that the patient has atherosclerotic disease and is at risk for clot formation. The use of streptokinase, a thrombolytic agent, further increases the risk of clot-related complications.

Therefore, the presence of hemoptysis in this patient would be the most concerning development over the next 24 hours, as it could indicate a potentially life-threatening complication related to the anteroseptal infarction.",
"A 65-year-old male presents to his pulmonologist for a follow-up visit. He has a history of chronic progressive dyspnea over the past five years. He uses oxygen at home and was seen in the emergency room two months prior for an exacerbation of his dyspnea. He was discharged following stabilization. His past medical history is notable for hyperlipidemia and hypertension. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 45 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 140/75 mmHg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 22/min. On examination, increased work of breathing is noted. The physician decides to start the patient on an additional medication that has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. What is the primary mechanism of action of this medication in the lungs?
Options:
(A): DNA hydrolysis
(B): Disulfide bond cleavage
(C): Endothelin-1 antagonism
(D): Osmotic hydration of airway lumen
(E): Reduction in airway surface tension
",Disulfide bond cleavage,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Disulfide bond cleavage.

Explanation:
The medication being prescribed to the patient has both mucoactive and anti-oxidative properties. This suggests that it is targeting the mucus production and oxidative stress in the lungs. Disulfide bond cleavage is the primary mechanism of action of this medication in the lungs.

Disulfide bonds are strong covalent bonds that form between two cysteine residues in proteins. These bonds play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and stability of proteins. In the lungs, disulfide bonds contribute to the formation of mucus, which can become thick and sticky in conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

By cleaving the disulfide bonds, the medication helps to break down the mucus, making it less viscous and easier to clear from the airways. This promotes better airflow and reduces the symptoms of dyspnea.

Additionally, disulfide bond cleavage also has anti-oxidative properties. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to detoxify them. In conditions like COPD, there is an increased production of ROS, leading to inflammation and tissue damage in the lungs.

By cleaving the disulfide bonds, the medication helps to reduce the oxidative stress in the lungs. This can help to decrease inflammation and protect the lung tissue from further damage.

Overall, the primary mechanism of action of this medication in the lungs is disulfide bond cleavage, which helps to break down mucus and reduce oxidative stress, improving airflow and reducing symptoms in patients with chronic dyspnea.",
"A 36-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2, at 42 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for induction of labor. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her two other children were born after uncomplicated vaginal deliveries at 41 and 42 weeks' gestation, respectively. Her only medication is a prenatal vitamin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (200 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg. Examination shows a nontender, soft uterus consistent in size with a 42-weeks' gestation. This patient's child is at greatest risk for which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Polyhydramnios
(B): Acute respiratory distress syndrome
(C): Caudal regression syndrome
(D): Meconium aspiration
(E): Placental abruption
",Meconium aspiration,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Meconium aspiration.

Explanation:
Meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) is a potential complication in post-term pregnancies, such as this patient's. MAS occurs when a fetus passes meconium (the first stool) into the amniotic fluid and subsequently inhales it into the lungs. This can lead to airway obstruction, chemical pneumonitis, and respiratory distress in the newborn. Risk factors for MAS include post-term gestation, maternal hypertension, and fetal distress. In this case, the patient is at 42 weeks' gestation, which increases the risk of meconium aspiration for her child. The other options are not associated with post-term pregnancies or are not relevant to this patient's clinical presentation.",
"The only immunoglobulin found as a dimer has what primary function?
Options:
(A): Protect against invasive helminth infection
(B): Protect against viral infections
(C): Provide an initial humoral immune response to newly presenting bacterial antigens
(D): Inhibiting bacterial adherance and colonization of mucous membranes
(E): Provides the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream
",Inhibiting bacterial adherance and colonization of mucous membranes,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Inhibiting bacterial adherence and colonization of mucous membranes.

Explanation:
The immunoglobulin that is found as a dimer is IgA. IgA is primarily responsible for inhibiting bacterial adherence and colonization of mucous membranes. It is found in high concentrations in mucosal secretions, such as saliva, tears, and respiratory and gastrointestinal tract secretions. IgA acts as a first line of defense by preventing bacteria from attaching to and invading the mucous membranes. This function helps to prevent infections in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. IgA also plays a role in neutralizing toxins and inflammatory molecules produced by bacteria. 

Option (A): Protect against invasive helminth infection
IgE, not IgA, is primarily responsible for protecting against invasive helminth infections. IgE is involved in allergic reactions and plays a role in the immune response against parasites.

Option (B): Protect against viral infections
While IgA can provide some protection against viral infections, it is not its primary function. IgG is the main immunoglobulin involved in protecting against viral infections.

Option (C): Provide an initial humoral immune response to newly presenting bacterial antigens
The primary antibody response to newly presenting bacterial antigens is mainly mediated by IgM, not IgA. IgM is the first antibody produced in response to an infection and provides an initial immune response.

Option (E): Provides the most specific recognition to circulating antigens in the bloodstream
While IgA can recognize circulating antigens, it is not the most specific immunoglobulin for this function. IgG is the most prevalent immunoglobulin in the bloodstream and provides the most specific recognition to circulating antigens.",
"A 47-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by paramedics. She was found unconscious on a park bench by a bystander. Her history is unobtainable. Vitals include a pulse of 64/min, a respiratory rate of 7/min, and a blood pressure of 110/70 mm Hg. On examination, the patient is unresponsive to voice and touch but shows a flexor response to pain. Her breathing is shallow. The pupils are constricted, and a response to light cannot be determined. An arterial blood gas sample reveals:
pH 7.26
Pco2 70 mm Hg
HCO3-  26 mEq/L
Which of the following could explain this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): COPD exacerbation
(B): Diabetic ketoacidosis
(C): Diuretic overdose
(D): Hyperventilation
(E): Opioid overdose
",Opioid overdose,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Opioid overdose.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with opioid overdose. Opioids, such as heroin or prescription pain medications, can cause respiratory depression, leading to shallow breathing and a decreased respiratory rate. This can result in hypoxia and hypercapnia, as seen in the arterial blood gas sample with a low pH and high Pco2. The constricted pupils and unresponsiveness to pain are also characteristic findings in opioid overdose. The flexor response to pain suggests intact brainstem function despite the depressed level of consciousness. The other options are less likely to explain this patient's presentation. COPD exacerbation would typically present with increased respiratory effort and a higher respiratory rate. Diabetic ketoacidosis would be associated with an increased anion gap metabolic acidosis and would not cause respiratory depression. Diuretic overdose would not cause the respiratory depression seen in this patient. Hyperventilation would result in a respiratory alkalosis, not the acidosis seen in this patient.",
"A 72-year-old woman with a 40 pack-year history of smoking presents to your office with jaundice. After a thorough workup, you determine that the patient has pancreatic cancer. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial statement to inform the patient of her condition?
Options:
(A): ""Have you ever heard of pancreatic cancer?""
(B): ""I have bad news I need to share with you. Please sit down so we can discuss.""
(C): ""Have you designated a healthcare proxy?""
(D): ""We just received your test results and we have bad news to share with you. The resident will be in to explain the diagnosis to you.""
(E): ""Your test results are consistent with a pancreatic adenocarcinoma.""
","""I have bad news I need to share with you. Please sit down so we can discuss.""",Correct,"The correct answer is (B): ""I have bad news I need to share with you. Please sit down so we can discuss.""

Explanation:
When delivering a diagnosis of cancer, it is important to be direct and compassionate. Option (B) is the most appropriate initial statement because it acknowledges the need to share bad news and invites the patient to sit down for a discussion. This approach allows the patient to mentally prepare for the news and provides an opportunity for the healthcare provider to address any immediate concerns or questions the patient may have. Options (A), (C), (D), and (E) do not address the need to deliver bad news or provide an appropriate setting for a discussion about the diagnosis.",
"A 40-year-old man is referred to an optometrist. He complains of mild vision impairment over the last 6 months. His vision has continued to slowly deteriorate and his condition is now affecting his night driving. Past medical history is significant for well-controlled schizophrenia. He takes a low-potency typical antipsychotics and a multivitamin every day. He has been compliant with his medication and has regular follow-up visits. What is the best first step in the management of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Decrease medication dosage
(B): Reassurance
(C): Ocular examination under anesthesia
(D): Refer to ophthalmologist
(E): Slit-lamp examination
",Slit-lamp examination,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Slit-lamp examination.

Explanation:
Given the patient's complaint of mild vision impairment that has been slowly deteriorating over the last 6 months, it is important to evaluate the patient's eyes for any potential underlying causes. The slit-lamp examination is a standard diagnostic tool used by optometrists and ophthalmologists to examine the structures of the eye, including the cornea, iris, lens, and retina. This examination can help identify any abnormalities or conditions that may be contributing to the patient's vision impairment.

Decreasing medication dosage (option A) may not be appropriate in this case, as the patient's schizophrenia is well-controlled and there is no indication that the antipsychotic medication is causing the vision impairment.

Reassurance (option B) may be appropriate after a thorough examination, but it should not be the first step in management. It is important to identify any potential underlying causes of the vision impairment before providing reassurance.

Ocular examination under anesthesia (option C) is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for cases where a patient is unable to cooperate with a regular examination. There is no indication in the scenario that the patient would require anesthesia for an examination.

Referring to an ophthalmologist (option D) may be necessary if the optometrist identifies any significant abnormalities during the slit-lamp examination. However, the initial step should be to perform the examination and determine if a referral is necessary.

In summary, the best first step in the management of this patient's symptoms is to perform a slit-lamp examination to evaluate the structures of the eye and identify any potential underlying causes of the vision impairment.",
"A 65-year-old man presents with a 6-month history of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness and a 13.6 kg (30 lb) weight loss. He is a vegetarian. The patient’s family says that he had been high functioning but has had significant behavioral changes over the past year. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol consumption, or illicit drug use. No significant family history. His vital signs include: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg without postural changes, pulse 92/min, respiratory rate 16/min, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉). Physical examination reveals a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin man. He is irritable, paranoid, and delusional but denies any hallucinations. An unstable, wide-based ataxic gait is noted. Laboratory results are significant for the following:
Hb 6.1 g/dL
MCV 109 fL
Platelets 90,0000/mm3
Total count 3,000/mm3
Reticulocyte count 0.8%
A peripheral blood smear demonstrates hypersegmented neutrophils. Anti-intrinsic factor antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
 
Options:
(A): Hypothyroidism
(B): Folate deficiency
(C): Vitamin B12 deficiency
(D): Parvovirus infection
(E): Pernicious anemia
",Vitamin B12 deficiency,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Vitamin B12 deficiency.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency, also known as cobalamin deficiency. This deficiency can occur in individuals who follow a strict vegetarian or vegan diet, as vitamin B12 is primarily found in animal products. The patient's symptoms of repeated falls, postural dizziness, progressive fatigue, generalized weakness, and weight loss are all characteristic of vitamin B12 deficiency.

The physical examination findings of a poorly groomed, disheveled, thin appearance, along with irritability, paranoia, and delusions, suggest neurological manifestations of vitamin B12 deficiency. Neurological symptoms can occur due to the demyelination of nerve fibers caused by the deficiency.

The laboratory results are also consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency. The low hemoglobin (Hb) level of 6.1 g/dL indicates anemia, which can be caused by impaired DNA synthesis in red blood cell precursors. The elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 109 fL suggests macrocytic anemia, which is commonly seen in vitamin B12 deficiency. The low platelet count and total white blood cell count are also consistent with this deficiency.

The presence of hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear is a characteristic finding in vitamin B12 deficiency. These neutrophils have more than five lobes in their nuclei, indicating impaired DNA synthesis.

The negative anti-intrinsic factor antibodies make pernicious anemia less likely as the cause of the patient's condition. Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune condition that leads to vitamin B12 deficiency due to the destruction of gastric parietal cells, which produce intrinsic factor necessary for vitamin B12 absorption.

In summary, the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and peripheral blood smear results are all consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.",
"A 42-year-old man presents to establish care with a family physician after having progressively worsening back pain. He has recently migrated from Sweden and has not had any checkups in the last 3 years. He first started having back pain 3 years ago, but his pain has begun to be excruciating in the mornings. He is no longer able to get relief with over the counter medications. He also feels stiff every morning and this usually lasts between 30 minutes and an hour. Both of his knees are also very painful, particularly upon standing up from a seated position. His pain improves when he moves around, so he tries to be somewhat physically active. He also reports that he cannot use his hands for long periods of time due to joint pain and stiffness. His father and sister also have joint issues, and his mother was recently diagnosed with osteoporosis. He has been a smoker for 13 years. Upon physical examination, his wrist and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints are warm and swollen. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): Testing for serum Ca and PTH
(B): Calcium and Vitamin D prescription
(C): Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies
(D): Testing for serum ferritin
(E): Synovial fluid aspiration
",Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Testing for serum ESR and autoantibodies.

The patient's presentation is consistent with inflammatory arthritis, which is characterized by joint pain, stiffness, and swelling. The fact that his symptoms are worse in the morning and improve with movement is suggestive of inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Testing for serum ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and autoantibodies is the next best step in management. ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation and can be elevated in various inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. Autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies, are specific markers for rheumatoid arthritis.

These tests can help confirm the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis and guide further management. If the ESR is elevated and autoantibodies are positive, it would support the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Further evaluation, such as imaging studies (e.g., X-rays) and referral to a rheumatologist, may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and treatment.

Testing for serum calcium and PTH (option A) is not indicated in this patient as his symptoms and physical examination findings are not suggestive of a calcium or parathyroid hormone disorder.

Prescribing calcium and vitamin D (option B) is not appropriate in this patient as his symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with a deficiency of these nutrients.

Testing for serum ferritin (option D) is not indicated in this patient as his symptoms and physical examination findings are not suggestive of iron deficiency.

Synovial fluid aspiration (option E) may be considered in patients with joint effusion or suspected septic arthritis, but it is not the next best step in management for this patient.",
"A previously healthy 28-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of dizziness and palpitations for 2 days. Prior to the onset of the symptoms, he attended a bachelor party where he lost several drinking games. An ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomoyopathy
(B): Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation
(C): Brugada syndrome
(D): Ventricular tachycardia
(E): Sick sinus syndrome
",Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

Explanation:
The ECG shown in the question is characteristic of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm with no discernible P waves and an irregular ventricular response. It can cause symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and shortness of breath. 

In this case, the patient's symptoms of dizziness and palpitations, along with the history of heavy drinking at a bachelor party, are suggestive of alcohol-induced atrial fibrillation. Excessive alcohol consumption can trigger atrial fibrillation in susceptible individuals, especially in the setting of binge drinking. 

Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (A) is unlikely in this case as it typically presents with symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope, and the ECG findings would show left ventricular hypertrophy. 

Brugada syndrome (C) is unlikely as it typically presents with a characteristic ECG pattern of ST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads and is associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. 

Ventricular tachycardia (D) is less likely in this case as the ECG shown does not demonstrate the characteristic wide QRS complexes seen in ventricular tachycardia. 

Sick sinus syndrome (E) is less likely as it typically presents with symptoms such as syncope, bradycardia, and alternating bradycardia and tachycardia. The ECG findings would show sinus node dysfunction. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.",
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and a weight loss of 4 kg (8.8 lb) over the last 4 months. She has recently avoided drinking alcohol and eating spicy food because it worsens her diarrhea and causes episodes of heart palpitations and reddening of the face and neck. She takes lisinopril for hypertension. Her temperature is 36.5°C (97.7°F), pulse is 98/min, and blood pressure is 149/90 mm Hg. The abdomen is soft, and there is mild tenderness to palpation with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show an increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration. Further evaluation of this patient will most likely show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Proximal muscle wasting
(B): Achlorhydria
(C): Adrenal medullary mass
(D): Multiple peptic ulcers
(E): Pulmonic valve stenosis
",Pulmonic valve stenosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Pulmonic valve stenosis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, abdominal cramps, watery diarrhea, and weight loss, along with the avoidance of alcohol and spicy food due to worsening symptoms, are suggestive of carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid syndrome is caused by the release of vasoactive substances, such as serotonin, by neuroendocrine tumors, most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration is a marker of serotonin metabolism and further supports the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome.

In patients with carcinoid syndrome, the vasoactive substances released by the tumors can cause fibrosis and thickening of the cardiac valves, particularly the tricuspid and pulmonic valves. This can lead to valvular stenosis or regurgitation. In this patient, the most likely finding on further evaluation would be pulmonic valve stenosis.

Proximal muscle wasting (option A) is not typically associated with carcinoid syndrome. It is more commonly seen in conditions such as Cushing's syndrome or malnutrition.

Achlorhydria (option B) refers to the absence of hydrochloric acid production in the stomach. While it can be seen in some patients with carcinoid syndrome, it is not a specific finding and is not the most likely finding in this patient.

Adrenal medullary mass (option C) is not a typical finding in carcinoid syndrome. Adrenal medullary masses are associated with pheochromocytomas, which can cause similar symptoms to carcinoid syndrome but are not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Purple-red colored urine (option D) is not a typical finding in carcinoid syndrome. The increased urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration is a marker of serotonin metabolism but does not cause a change in urine color.

Therefore, the most likely finding on further evaluation in this patient with carcinoid syndrome would be pulmonic valve stenosis.",
"A 66-year-old man presents to the emergency department due to a productive cough. His cough has been increasing in frequency and severity over the course of 3 days, and his sputum production has increased in volume. The color of his sputum is yellow-green. He denies any chest pain or palpitations but has experienced worsening shortness of breath with exertion and at rest, which is above his baseline. He has not noticed any changes in his weight or edema in his lower extremities. He denies any recent history of long travel. Medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). He has been hospitalized four times for similar symptoms within the last year. He has smoked approximately 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 45 years. His temperature is 102°F (38.9°C), blood pressure is 156/94 mmHg, pulse is 101/min, and respirations are 26/min with an oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. On physical exam, the patient has difficulty speaking, and there is asynchronous motion between the chest and abdomen with respiration. Wheezing is appreciated on pulmonary auscultation. An ECG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm. A chest radiograph is obtained, and he is administered supplemental oxygen. He is started on ipratropium, albuterol, and methylprednisolone. Which of the following should be added to this patient's treatment regimen?
Options:
(A): Amoxicillin
(B): Cefazolin
(C): Ceftriaxone
(D): Levofloxacin
(E): Penicillin
",Levofloxacin,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Levofloxacin.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The increased sputum production, yellow-green color, and worsening shortness of breath are indicative of an infection, most likely bacterial. Antibiotic therapy is recommended for patients with COPD exacerbations who have increased sputum purulence and increased dyspnea. Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic that provides broad-spectrum coverage against common respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. It is a suitable choice for empiric antibiotic therapy in this patient. Amoxicillin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, and penicillin are not the best choices for this patient because they do not provide adequate coverage against the likely pathogens causing the exacerbation.",
"A 55-year-old man presents with bloody nasal secretions and shortness of breath. He reports he has lost 4 kg (8.8 lb) in the last two months with no changes in his diet. He has also been suffering from mild to moderate joint pain in the left knee for the last year. His past medical history is unremarkable. His vitals include: blood pressure 120/70 mm Hg, temperature 37.0℃ (98.6℉), pulse 70/min, respiratory rate 14/min. Physical examination is significant for nasal ulcers. Diffuse crackles are present over all lobes of the lung bilaterally. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin 12.9 g/dL
Hematocrit 37.7%
Leukocyte count 5500/mm3
Neutrophils 65%
Lymphocytes 30%
Monocytes 5%
Mean corpuscular volume 82.2 μm3
Platelet count 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 35 mm/h
C-reactive protein 14 mg/dL
Creatinine 3.09 mg/dL
The patient is prescribed a corticosteroid nasal spray and oral antibiotics but returns in 2 weeks without any clinical improvement. Which of the following would most likely confirm the diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies
(B): Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(C): Anti-histone bodies
(D): Anti-Ro
(E): Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
",Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of bloody nasal secretions, shortness of breath, weight loss, joint pain, and laboratory findings of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein suggest a systemic autoimmune disease. The presence of nasal ulcers and diffuse crackles on lung examination further support this suspicion. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are associated with several autoimmune diseases, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis. These diseases can cause upper and lower respiratory tract involvement, as well as renal disease. ANCA testing, specifically for anti-proteinase 3 (PR3) and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibodies, is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis in this patient. Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but this patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-histone antibodies are associated with drug-induced lupus, and anti-Ro antibodies are associated with Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, but these conditions do not explain the patient's respiratory symptoms and weight loss. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and is already elevated in this patient.",
"A 25-year-old Hispanic male presents with heat intolerance and recent weight loss. Serum analysis shows increased levels of T4 and T3, as well as the presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins. The patient is found to be tachycardic and has marked edema and waxy discoloration in his legs. Which of the following would be consistent with this patient's disease?
Options:
(A): Sympathetic underactivity
(B): Anti-thyroglobin antibodies
(C): Exophthalmos
(D): Increased TSH release
(E): Multinucleate giant cells present in the thyroid
",Exophthalmos,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Exophthalmos.

Exophthalmos, also known as proptosis or bulging eyes, is a classic symptom of thyrotoxicosis, which is an excessive production of thyroid hormones. In this case, the patient's serum analysis shows increased levels of T4 and T3, indicating hyperthyroidism. Exophthalmos is commonly associated with hyperthyroidism, particularly in Graves' disease, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of thyroglobulin-stimulating immunoglobulins.

The patient's symptoms of heat intolerance and recent weight loss are also consistent with hyperthyroidism. Heat intolerance is a common symptom due to increased metabolic rate, and weight loss despite increased appetite is a result of increased energy expenditure. Other symptoms of hyperthyroidism may include nervousness, diaphoresis (excessive sweating), diarrhea, tremor, and palpitations.

The presence of marked edema and waxy discoloration in the patient's legs suggests pretibial myxedema, which is a skin manifestation associated with Graves' disease. This occurs due to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the skin, leading to swelling and a waxy appearance.

Sympathetic underactivity (option A) is not consistent with the patient's symptoms, as hyperthyroidism is associated with increased sympathetic activity.

Anti-thyroglobin antibodies (option B) may be present in autoimmune thyroid diseases, but they are not specifically associated with the symptoms described in this patient.

Increased TSH release (option D) is not consistent with the patient's presentation. In hyperthyroidism, there is typically suppressed TSH levels due to the negative feedback from increased levels of thyroid hormones.

Multinucleate giant cells present in the thyroid (option E) are not associated with hyperthyroidism. They may be seen in certain thyroid conditions, such as granulomatous thyroiditis, but they are not specific to this patient's disease.",
"A 3-day-old male is evaluated in the hospital nursery for delayed passage of meconium. His mother is breastfeeding and has started to produce milk. The patient has been feeding well every two hours and is urinating over eight times per day. The patient was born at 35 weeks gestation to a 27-year-old gravida 4. The patient is of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and the patient’s parents denied all prenatal genetic testing. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until the patient’s mother had spontaneous rupture of membranes at 35 weeks gestation. The patient’s three older siblings are all healthy. In the hospital nursery, the patient’s temperature is 98.2°F (36.8°C), blood pressure is 48/32 mmHg, pulse is 164/min, and respirations are 48/min. On physical exam, he appears to be in moderate distress. He has no dysmorphic features, and his abdomen is distended and non-tender. Bowel sounds are absent.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Abdominal CT
(B): Abdominal radiograph
(C): Contrast enema
(D): Upper gastrointestinal series
(E): Sweat testing
",Abdominal radiograph,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Abdominal radiograph.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with delayed passage of meconium, abdominal distension, absent bowel sounds, and signs of moderate distress. These findings are concerning for a possible bowel obstruction. The best next step in management is to obtain an abdominal radiograph.

Abdominal radiographs can help identify the presence and location of any bowel obstruction. In this case, an abdominal radiograph can help determine if there is a mechanical obstruction, such as meconium ileus, which is commonly seen in patients with cystic fibrosis. It can also help identify other causes of bowel obstruction, such as Hirschsprung disease or intestinal atresia.

Abdominal CT (option A) is not the best next step in management because it exposes the patient to unnecessary radiation and is not the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluating bowel obstruction in a newborn.

Contrast enema (option C) and upper gastrointestinal series (option D) may be useful in certain cases to further evaluate the cause and location of the obstruction, but they are not the initial imaging studies of choice. Abdominal radiograph is the first-line imaging study in this scenario.

Sweat testing (option E) is not indicated in this case. Sweat testing is used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, but there is no indication in the scenario to suggest cystic fibrosis as the cause of the patient's symptoms.",
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the office for an annual health check-up with her family physician accompanied by her daughter. She has no complaints during this visit but her daughter states that she is having difficulty locating objects such as the television remote, car keys, and her purse. Her medical history is significant for Alzheimer’s dementia, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and centrilobular emphysema. The patient takes memantine, atorvastatin, metformin, levothyroxine, lisinopril, aspirin, albuterol, and ipratropium. The patient’s vitals are within normal limits today. Physical exam reveals an elderly female in no acute distress, oriented to person, place and year, but not to month or day of the week. She has a 3/6 holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border along with an S3 gallop. There are mild crackles at the lung bases. The remainder of the exam is normal. A previous urine culture reports growth of > 100,000 CFU of Enterobacter. Urinalysis findings are offered below:
Leukocyte esterase  positive
WBCs 50-100 cell/HPF
Nitrites positive
RBCs 2 cell/HPF
Epithelial cells 2 cell/HPF
Urine pH 5.7
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?
Options:
(A): TMP-SMX
(B): Nitrofurantoin
(C): Levofloxacin
(D): Cephalexin
(E): No treatment is necessary
",No treatment is necessary,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) No treatment is necessary.

Explanation:
The patient in this case is an elderly woman with Alzheimer's dementia who is asymptomatic and has positive urine culture findings. However, it is important to note that asymptomatic bacteriuria is common in elderly individuals, especially those with dementia. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is defined as the presence of bacteria in the urine without any symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It is estimated that up to 50% of elderly women in long-term care facilities have asymptomatic bacteriuria.

In this case, the patient has positive urine culture findings with >100,000 CFU of Enterobacter, leukocyte esterase positive, and WBCs present in the urine. However, it is important to consider the patient's clinical presentation and the fact that she is asymptomatic. Asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly individuals, especially those with dementia, does not require treatment. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria in this population has not been shown to improve outcomes and can lead to unnecessary antibiotic use, which can contribute to antibiotic resistance and adverse effects.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case is to not treat the asymptomatic bacteriuria and to monitor the patient for any development of symptoms or complications. It is important to educate the patient and her daughter about the presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and the rationale for not treating it. Regular follow-up and monitoring of the patient's urinary symptoms and overall health should be done.",
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of painful ulcers in her mouth. Over the past 2 months, she has had increasing fatigue and difficulties concentrating. She has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and was started on a new medication 4 months ago. Examination shows pallor of the mucosal membranes and three tender ulcerative lesions in her mouth. Her hemoglobin concentration is 8.7 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is 109 μm3. A blood smear shows hypersegmented neutrophils. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
Options:
(A): Deficient heme synthesis
(B): Deficient DNA crosslink repair
(C): Deficient erythropoietin secretion
(D): Deficient nitrogenous base production
(E): Deficient β-globin chains
",Deficient nitrogenous base production,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Deficient nitrogenous base production.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by macrocytic red blood cells (elevated mean corpuscular volume) and hypersegmented neutrophils on blood smear. Megaloblastic anemia is most commonly caused by a deficiency in vitamin B12 or folate, both of which are necessary for the production of nitrogenous bases (thymine and purines) for DNA synthesis. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, difficulties concentrating, and mouth ulcers are also consistent with megaloblastic anemia. The history of rheumatoid arthritis and recent initiation of a new medication may be relevant, as certain medications can interfere with the absorption or metabolism of vitamin B12 or folate. Deficient heme synthesis (choice A) would not cause macrocytic anemia or hypersegmented neutrophils. Deficient DNA crosslink repair (choice B) is not associated with megaloblastic anemia. Deficient erythropoietin secretion (choice C) would result in a normocytic or microcytic anemia, not a macrocytic anemia. Deficient β-globin chains (choice E) would result in a microcytic anemia, not a macrocytic anemia.",
"A 25-year-old woman presents to her primary care provider for evaluation of a ""painful mass in my left groin."" She says that her symptoms began 4 days ago as a painful mass that slowly enlarged, ruptured, and ulcerated. However, she denies fever, chills, dysuria, or hematuria. Three weeks prior to her current symptoms she noted a small, painless ulcer on her labium majorum that resolved after a few days. She admits to having unprotected sex with a male partner a month ago while she was traveling in Southeast Asia. Temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 139/84 mmHg, pulse is 76/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination is significant for left-sided, tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. Which of the following is most likely to be seen in this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain
(B): Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain
(C): PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis
(D): Positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS
(E): Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells
",PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) PCR positive for Chlamydia trachomatis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1, L2, and L3. LGV typically presents with a painless ulcer at the site of inoculation, followed by the development of tender, ulcerative lymph nodes with a dark discoloration. The inguinal lymph nodes are commonly affected in LGV. 

To confirm the diagnosis, PCR testing for Chlamydia trachomatis would be the most appropriate. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting the DNA of Chlamydia trachomatis in clinical samples. It can accurately identify the specific serovars causing the infection, including the L serovars associated with LGV.

Donovan bodies on Wright-Giemsa stain (choice A) are seen in granuloma inguinale, not LGV. Granuloma inguinale is caused by Klebsiella granulomatis and typically presents with painless, progressive genital ulcers.

Gram-negative rods in school of fish formation on Gram stain (choice B) are seen in chancroid, not LGV. Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi and presents with painful genital ulcers and inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Positive RPR, VDRL, and FTA-ABS (choice D) are seen in syphilis, not LGV. Syphilis presents with painless genital ulcers (chancre) and can cause systemic manifestations if left untreated.

Tzanck smear with multinucleated giant cells (choice E) is seen in herpes simplex virus infection, not LGV. Herpes simplex virus infection presents with painful genital vesicles that can rupture and form ulcers.",
"A 70-year-old hypertensive and hyperlipidemic woman comes to the emergency department with chief complaints of acute onset of impaired speech and comprehension with a right-sided weakness for the last 1.5 hours. The patient was on 2 antihypertensive medications and a statin, but she was not receiving any antiplatelet drugs. She has a blood pressure of 136/94, heart rate of 84/min, and respiratory rate of 15/min. Initial examination shows global aphasia, right homonymous hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. An acute ischemic stroke caused by distal left internal carotid artery occlusion with salvageable penumbral tissue is diagnosed based on a non-contrast CT scan, brain MRI, and catheter cerebral angiogram. Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator is given as treatment within 3 hours of presentation. Which of the following cellular processes is typical of the section of reversible injury noted in this patient?
Options:
(A): Mitochondrial permeability
(B): Caspase activation
(C): Lysosomal rupture
(D): Severe membrane damage
(E): Decreased ATP
",Decreased ATP,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Decreased ATP.

Explanation:
In the context of an acute ischemic stroke, the section of reversible injury is characterized by decreased ATP production. Ischemia leads to a decrease in oxygen and glucose supply to the affected brain tissue, resulting in impaired energy production through oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. This leads to a decrease in ATP levels, which is a critical energy source for cellular processes. The decrease in ATP levels can result in cellular dysfunction and ultimately cell death if not promptly restored. In this patient, the administration of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) aims to restore blood flow to the affected area, thereby increasing oxygen and glucose supply and restoring ATP production.",
"During the normal catabolism of protein, urea and ammonia are produced as waste products. If these waste products are not cleared by the liver and kidneys, hyperammonemia can occur, leading to confusion and delirium. Fortunately, a healthy liver can clear these waste products via the urea cycle. Which of the following reactions is the rate limiting step in this cycle?
Options:
(A): NH3 + HCO3- + 2 ATP --> carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + Pi
(B): Carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine --> citrulline+ Pi
(C): Citrulline + aspartate + ATP --> arginosuccinate + AMP + PPi
(D): Argininosuccinate --> Arginine + fumarate
(E): Arginine + H20 --> ornithine + urea
",NH3 + HCO3- + 2 ATP --> carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + Pi,Correct,"The correct choice is (A): NH3 + HCO3- + 2 ATP --> carbamoyl phosphate + 2 ADP + Pi.

Explanation:
The rate limiting step in the urea cycle is the conversion of ammonia (NH3) and bicarbonate (HCO3-) to carbamoyl phosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I (CPSI). This step requires the input of energy in the form of two ATP molecules. Carbamoyl phosphate is an important intermediate in the urea cycle and is further metabolized to produce urea.

The other options in the question are steps in the urea cycle, but they are not the rate limiting step. Here is a brief explanation of each step:

(B): Carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine --> citrulline + Pi: This step is catalyzed by the enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and converts carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline. It is an important step in the urea cycle, but it is not the rate limiting step.

(C): Citrulline + aspartate + ATP --> arginosuccinate + AMP + PPi: This step is catalyzed by the enzyme argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) and involves the conversion of citrulline and aspartate into arginosuccinate. It is an important step in the urea cycle, but it is not the rate limiting step.

(D): Argininosuccinate --> Arginine + fumarate: This step is catalyzed by the enzyme argininosuccinase (ASL) and involves the conversion of argininosuccinate into arginine and fumarate. It is an important step in the urea cycle, but it is not the rate limiting step.

(E): Arginine + H20 --> ornithine + urea: This step is catalyzed by the enzyme arginase and involves the conversion of arginine into ornithine and urea. It is the final step in the urea cycle, but it is not the rate limiting step.",
"A 46-year-old man presents with worsening pain in multiple joints for the past 2 weeks. He says the pain is most severe in the proximal parts of his fingers and his wrists, but it has now spread to his elbows, and, occasionally, his knees. He says the joint involvement is symmetric. He also complains of morning joint stiffness that improves with activity and reports feeling fatigued during the day. He started taking ibuprofen 2 months ago for the pain which initially subsided, but, over the last few weeks, it has worsened despite the medication. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago and has had difficulty controlling his blood glucose levels. The patient denies any smoking history, alcohol, or recreational drug use. A review of systems is significant for a weight loss of 3.0 kg (6.6 lb) over the last 3 months despite no change in diet or activity level. Which of the following is the most likely 1st-line medication in this patient?
Options:
(A): Cyclosporine
(B): Infliximab
(C): Anakinra
(D): Methotrexate
(E): High-dose prednisone for 60 days
",Methotrexate,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Methotrexate.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The patient's joint pain, morning stiffness, and symmetric joint involvement are characteristic of RA. Additionally, the patient's fatigue and weight loss may be associated with the systemic inflammation seen in RA.

Methotrexate is considered the first-line medication for the treatment of RA. It is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that helps to reduce inflammation and slow down the progression of joint damage. Methotrexate is effective in controlling the symptoms of RA and improving long-term outcomes.

Cyclosporine, infliximab, and anakinra are also used in the treatment of RA, but they are typically reserved for patients who do not respond adequately to methotrexate or other DMARDs. High-dose prednisone may be used for short-term symptom relief, but it is not recommended as a long-term treatment option due to its potential side effects.

Therefore, methotrexate is the most appropriate first-line medication for this patient with RA.",
"A previously healthy 29-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 35 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a routine prenatal visit. Current medications include folic acid and a multivitamin. A rectovaginal swab culture grows bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism?
Options:
(A): Schedule delivery of the fetus via C-section
(B): Abstain from breastfeeding
(C): Administer ampicillin intrapartum
(D): Perform amniocentesis at 37 weeks
(E): Administer intravenous immune globulin postpartum
",Administer ampicillin intrapartum,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Administer ampicillin intrapartum.

Explanation:
The most appropriate intervention to decrease vertical transmission of this organism is to administer ampicillin intrapartum. This is because the rectovaginal swab culture grew bacitracin-resistant colonies of gram-positive cocci with surrounding areas of clear hemolysis, which is consistent with Group B Streptococcus (GBS) infection. Intrapartum administration of ampicillin or penicillin to colonized women reduces the risk of infection in the newborn. The CDC recommends screening for GBS colonization at 35-37 weeks of pregnancy and providing intrapartum chemoprophylaxis for culture-positive women or women with certain risk factors, such as a history of GBS bacteriuria during pregnancy or a previous infant with GBS infection. Therefore, administering ampicillin intrapartum is the most appropriate intervention in this case.",
"A 2-year-old girl is brought in to the office by her parents. They state that their daughter has recently been more irritable than usual, and she occasionally becomes pale and blue. Her parents note that she was diagnosed with a heart murmur, but it was never treated. Physical examination reveals a small child in distress. She is laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest. Cardiac auscultation reveals a harsh, systolic ejection murmur that is best heard at the upper left sternal border. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Tetralogy of Fallot
(B): Transposition of great vessels
(C): Pulmonary hypoplasia
(D): Atrial septal defect
(E): Patent ductus arteriosus
",Tetralogy of Fallot,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Tetralogy of Fallot.

Explanation:
The symptoms and physical examination findings described in the scenario are consistent with Tetralogy of Fallot. Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart defect characterized by four abnormalities: pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. 

The child's irritability and episodes of becoming pale and blue (cyanosis) are indicative of decreased oxygenation of the blood. This occurs because the pulmonary stenosis restricts blood flow to the lungs, leading to decreased oxygenation. The ventricular septal defect allows blood to mix between the right and left ventricles, resulting in oxygen-poor blood being pumped to the body.

The physical examination findings of a harsh, systolic ejection murmur best heard at the upper left sternal border are consistent with the pulmonic stenosis component of Tetralogy of Fallot. The murmur is caused by the obstruction of blood flow through the narrowed pulmonary valve.

The child's position of laying on the examination table with her knees drawn to her chest (squatting position) is a compensatory mechanism to improve blood flow to the lungs. Squatting increases systemic vascular resistance, which helps to maintain blood flow to the lungs and improve oxygenation.

In summary, the combination of symptoms, physical examination findings, and the presence of a heart murmur consistent with pulmonic stenosis suggests the most likely diagnosis of Tetralogy of Fallot.",
"An 18-year-old male is brought in by fire rescue. The patient was an unrestrained passenger in a motor vehicle crash and was ejected from the vehicle after collision. Upon arrival to the trauma bay, the patient has a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 6. He is rapidly intubated, and vitals are a temperature of 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse of 130 bpm, and blood pressure of 83/64 mmHg. He is noted to have multiple ecchymoses over his body, as well as petechiae and purpura. He has a laceration over his clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage. Radiographs of his lower extremity show multiple long bone fractures. Two large bore IV lines are placed, and the patient oozes from around the sites of venepuncture. Labs are notable for a WBC of 20,000/mm^3, Hb of 10.1g/dL, platelets of 48,000/mm^3, and prolongation of the PT and aPTT. This patient's presentation can best be explained by which of the following diagnoses?
Options:
(A): Fat embolization
(B): Air embolization
(C): Tension pneumothorax
(D): Disseminated intravascular coagulation
(E): Coagulopathy of trauma
",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Explanation:
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition characterized by widespread activation of the clotting cascade, leading to the formation of small blood clots throughout the body. This activation of the clotting cascade consumes clotting factors and platelets, leading to bleeding manifestations.

In this patient's case, the history of a motor vehicle crash with multiple injuries suggests a significant trauma. The presence of ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura indicates bleeding into the skin and mucous membranes, which is a characteristic finding in DIC. The laceration over the clavicle that continues to bleed despite a pressure bandage further supports the diagnosis of DIC.

The laboratory findings in this patient are also consistent with DIC. The low platelet count (48,000/mm^3) suggests platelet consumption, and the prolongation of the PT and aPTT indicates a deficiency of clotting factors. The elevated WBC count (20,000/mm^3) may be a reactive response to the ongoing inflammation and tissue injury.

Fat embolization (option A) occurs when fat globules enter the bloodstream and can cause respiratory distress and neurologic symptoms. However, the presence of ecchymoses, petechiae, and purpura in this patient is not consistent with fat embolization.

Air embolization (option B) occurs when air enters the bloodstream and can cause respiratory distress and cardiovascular collapse. However, the bleeding manifestations and laboratory findings in this patient are not consistent with air embolization.

Tension pneumothorax (option C) occurs when air accumulates in the pleural space and causes lung collapse and cardiovascular compromise. While tension pneumothorax can cause hypotension, it does not explain the bleeding manifestations and laboratory findings in this patient.

Coagulopathy of trauma (option E) refers to a disruption in the normal coagulation process due to trauma. While trauma can lead to coagulopathy, the specific findings in this patient, such as the low platelet count and prolongation of PT and aPTT, are more consistent with DIC.",
"A 60-year-old man presents to his local walk-in clinic with 1 week of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, progressive shortness of breath, and sharp chest pain. He is found with a blood pressure of 100/80 mm Hg, a heart rate of 84/min, an elevated respiratory rate, and a holosystolic heart murmur III/VI. His palms and soles show non-tender erythematous lesions. His personal medical history is relevant for frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding in the last month with a recent colonoscopy that reported an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer. He has not been subjected to dental procedures recently, and he denies the use of psychoactive drugs. A chest plain film shows clear lungs and mild cardiomegaly, and echocardiography reports the presence of vegetations involving the mitral valve. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?
Options:
(A): Kingella kingae
(B): Staphylococcus aureus
(C): Escherichia coli
(D): Haemophilus aphrophilus
(E): Streptococcus bovis
",Streptococcus bovis,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Streptococcus bovis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with infective endocarditis, which is an infection of the heart valves. The presence of fever, chills, night sweats, anorexia, malaise, and progressive shortness of breath are typical symptoms of infective endocarditis. The holosystolic heart murmur and the presence of vegetations on echocardiography further support this diagnosis.

The patient's history of frequent visits to the ER for lower gastrointestinal bleeding and the recent colonoscopy findings of an ulcerative lesion suggestive of colorectal cancer are important clues. Streptococcus bovis is strongly associated with colorectal cancer and is a common cause of infective endocarditis in patients with this condition. The non-tender erythematous lesions on the palms and soles, known as Osler's nodes, are also characteristic of infective endocarditis.

The other options, Kingella kingae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Haemophilus aphrophilus, are less likely to be the causative agent in this case. Kingella kingae is more commonly associated with infective endocarditis in children. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of infective endocarditis, but it typically presents with a more acute onset and is associated with a higher risk of complications. Escherichia coli and Haemophilus aphrophilus are less commonly associated with infective endocarditis.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation, history, and the association of Streptococcus bovis with colorectal cancer, Streptococcus bovis is the most likely causative agent in this case.",
"A 31-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the emergency department by police after being found agitated and attempting to steal from a grocery store. His past medical history is only notable for a recent office note from his primary care doctor for treatment of seasonal allergies. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 173/97 mmHg, pulse is 105/min, respirations are 16/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for a man who is very irritable and restless. He is not cooperative with exam or history and becomes combative requiring intramuscular medications and security restraining him. After this event, the rest of his exam is notable for 7 mm pupils which are equal and reactive to light, spontaneous movement of all limbs, normal sensation, and warm and sweaty skin. The patient is answering questions and states he wants to kill himself. Which of the following substances was most likely used by this patient?
Options:
(A): Alcohol
(B): Cocaine
(C): Diphenhydramine
(D): Haloperidol
(E): Marijuana
",Cocaine,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Cocaine.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with cocaine intoxication. Cocaine is a stimulant drug that can cause agitation, restlessness, irritability, and combative behavior. The elevated temperature, increased blood pressure, and rapid pulse are also consistent with the sympathomimetic effects of cocaine. The dilated pupils (7 mm) are a characteristic finding in cocaine intoxication. Additionally, the warm and sweaty skin is a common physical finding in individuals who have used cocaine. The patient's statement about wanting to kill himself is concerning for the potential psychiatric effects of cocaine, which can include mood disturbances and suicidal ideation.",
"A 40-year-old obese man presents to his primary care provider with a history of excessive daytime somnolence and easy fatigability. Upon further questioning, it is found that although his sleeping hours are adequate, he does not feel refreshed in the morning. His wife complains that he snores loudly all night. After ruling out common medical disorders and possible drug abuse, he is advised an overnight polysomnogram that records 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. Which of the following statements best describes this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.
(B): Episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during deeper stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep.
(C): Mouth opening during sleep breaks the seal between the tongue and the teeth and relieves airway obstruction.
(D): The most common site of a collapse of pharyngeal airway during sleep apnea is at the level of the base of the tongue.
(E): Gynoid obesity is associated with apnea and hypopnea more frequently as compared to android obesity.
",This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) This patient's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) is more than 5.

Explanation:
The patient's overnight polysomnogram recorded 12 episodes of apnea and 30 episodes of hypopnea during a 7-hour sleep. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) represents the total number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea occurring during sleep divided by the hours of sleep time. In this case, the AHI would be calculated as (12 + 30) / 7 = 6. This indicates that the patient has an AHI of more than 5, which is consistent with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, choice (A) is the correct answer.

Choice (B) is incorrect because episodes of apnea and hypopnea are more likely to occur during lighter stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep, not deeper stages.

Choice (C) is incorrect because mouth opening during sleep does not relieve airway obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea. In fact, mouth breathing can worsen the obstruction.

Choice (D) is incorrect because the most common site of collapse of the pharyngeal airway during sleep apnea is at the level of the soft palate and the uvula, not the base of the tongue.

Choice (E) is incorrect because gynoid obesity (fat distribution in the hips and thighs) is not specifically associated with apnea and hypopnea. Obesity in general, regardless of fat distribution, is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea.",
"A 70-year-old man presents with cough and progressively worsening shortness of breath for the last 6 months. He feels short of breath even without exertion and states he ‘got winded’ while walking to his bedroom last night. He describes his cough as non-productive and says he can identify no recognizable triggers. No significant past medical history. The patient is a retired welder and has been living with his son since his wife passed away 5 years ago. He denies any smoking history or current alcohol or drug use. His vital signs include: pulse rate 72/min, respiratory rate 15/min, blood pressure 134/80 mm Hg, and temperature 36.8°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, digital clubbing is noted. Bilateral basilar fine crackles on noted on pulmonary auscultation. Expiratory flow rates are measured and found to be high when corrected for lung volume. A chest X-ray is performed and shown in the image below. Which of the following most likely accounts for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient?
Options:
(A): Anatomical dead space
(B): Lung compliance
(C): Physiological dead space
(D): Radial traction on airway wall
(E): Small airway wall thickness
",Radial traction on airway wall,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Radial traction on airway wall.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario presents with cough, progressively worsening shortness of breath, and high expiratory flow rates when corrected for lung volume. These findings, along with the presence of digital clubbing and bilateral basilar fine crackles on pulmonary auscultation, suggest the presence of a condition known as pulmonary fibrosis.

Pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic lung disease characterized by the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, which leads to the thickening and stiffening of the lung tissue. This results in decreased lung compliance, making it harder for the lungs to expand and fill with air during inspiration. However, during expiration, the increased stiffness of the lung tissue causes the airways to remain open and resist collapse. This is known as radial traction on the airway wall.

Radial traction on the airway wall helps to maintain the patency of the airways and prevents their collapse during expiration. This increased radial traction on the airway wall leads to increased expiratory flow rates, as seen in the patient in the scenario.

The other options are not the most likely explanations for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient:

(A) Anatomical dead space refers to the portion of the respiratory system where no gas exchange occurs, such as the trachea and bronchi. It does not directly affect expiratory flow rates.

(B) Lung compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand and fill with air. In pulmonary fibrosis, lung compliance is decreased, not increased.

(C) Physiological dead space refers to the portion of the respiratory system where gas exchange is impaired, such as areas of the lung that are poorly perfused. It does not directly affect expiratory flow rates.

(E) Small airway wall thickness refers to the thickness of the walls of the small airways in the lungs. While increased small airway wall thickness can contribute to airflow limitation, it does not directly affect expiratory flow rates.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the increased expiratory flow rate in this patient is radial traction on the airway wall due to pulmonary fibrosis.",
"Two hours following an elective cholecystectomy, a 43-year-old woman has fever and chills. The patient received cephalexin for antibiotic prophylaxis and one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure. She underwent a hysterectomy 9 years ago for leiomyomata uteri. She has a 5-year history of hypertension treated with lisinopril. Her temperature is 39.5°C (102.3°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 125/90 mm Hg. Examination shows a mildly tender abdominal wound without erythema. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination shows no abnormalities. She had a Foley catheter and peripheral line access placed at the time of the procedure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Adverse effect of medication
(B): Malignant hyperthermia
(C): Surgical site infection
(D): Urinary tract infection
(E): Transfusion reaction
",Transfusion reaction,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Transfusion reaction.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fever and chills, along with the timing of two hours following the procedure, suggest an acute reaction to the blood transfusion. The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells during the procedure, which increases the likelihood of a transfusion reaction. The absence of erythema at the surgical site makes a surgical site infection less likely. The patient's vital signs, including blood pressure, are within normal limits, making adverse effects of medication or malignant hyperthermia less likely. There is no mention of urinary symptoms, making a urinary tract infection less likely. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is a transfusion reaction.",
"The first 24 hours after delivery, a 2888 g (6.37 lb) male newborn is not feeding well, has a high-pitched cry, and is diaphoretic. He was born at 38 weeks' gestation to a 30-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, after an uncomplicated labor and delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother did not receive prenatal care. She takes codeine syrup frequently for dry cough. The infant's temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 165/min, and blood pressure is 83/50 mm Hg. Examination shows hyperreflexia, tremors, and an excessive startle response. The baby is swaddled to prevent excoriations, and fluid resuscitation is initiated. Complete blood count and serum levels of glucose, bilirubin, and calcium are within normal limits. What is the most appropriate next step in treatment of this newborn?
Options:
(A): Oral morphine therapy
(B): Oral clonidine therapy
(C): Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy
(D): Oral methimazole therapy
(E): Dextrose infusion
",Oral morphine therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Oral morphine therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation of the newborn, including poor feeding, high-pitched cry, diaphoresis, hyperreflexia, tremors, and excessive startle response, along with the maternal history of codeine syrup use, the most likely diagnosis is neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) due to maternal opioid use. NAS occurs when a newborn is exposed to opioids in utero and experiences withdrawal symptoms after birth. The symptoms typically appear within the first 24-72 hours after delivery.

The most appropriate next step in the treatment of this newborn is oral morphine therapy. Morphine is the standard pharmacologic treatment for NAS and helps to alleviate withdrawal symptoms by providing a controlled and tapered dose of opioid medication. It is administered orally to the newborn and the dose is gradually reduced over time until the symptoms resolve.

The other options listed are not appropriate for the treatment of NAS. Oral clonidine therapy (B) is sometimes used as an adjunctive treatment for NAS, but it is not the initial treatment of choice. Intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin combination therapy (C) is used to treat bacterial infections, but there is no evidence of infection in this case. Oral methimazole therapy (D) is used to treat hyperthyroidism, which is not indicated in this newborn. Dextrose infusion (E) may be used to treat hypoglycemia, but there is no evidence of hypoglycemia in this case.",
"A 38-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, obesity, and hyperlipidemia presents to her primary care physician for evaluation of new bilateral blisters on her hands. She says that she first noticed these blisters shortly after returning from a weekend trip to the beach two weeks prior. She denies any fevers, joint pains, or other skin rash during this period. The patient works in the adult entertainment industry. On examination, there are multiple flaccid blisters of the bilateral dorsal hands with hemorrhagic crusts, mild scarring, and hyperpigmentation. In addition, increased hair growth is noted on the bilateral malar cheeks. Her temperature is 99.1° F (37.3° C), pulse is 95/min, blood pressure is 130/87 mmHg, respirations are 13/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Her laboratory results are:

Serum:
Na+: 140 mEq/L
K+: 4.5 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
HCO3-: 21 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Glucose: 104 mg/dL

Leukocyte count: 9,000/mm^3
Hemoglobin: 12.4 g/dL
Platelets: 400,000/mm^3

Anti-nuclear antibody titer 1:320

Which of the following would confirm the diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Anti dsDNA titers
(B): C-reactive protein
(C): Anti-hemidesmosome titers
(D): Urine porphyrin levels
(E): Tzanck smear
",Urine porphyrin levels,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Urine porphyrin levels.

Explanation:
The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, along with the presence of bilateral blisters on the hands, suggests a possible diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT). PCT is a type of porphyria that is characterized by the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin, leading to photosensitivity and blistering.

To confirm the diagnosis of PCT, urine porphyrin levels should be measured. PCT is associated with increased levels of uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin in the urine. Elevated urine porphyrin levels, particularly uroporphyrin and heptacarboxylporphyrin, are highly suggestive of PCT.

The other options are not specific for the diagnosis of PCT:
(A) Anti dsDNA titers are used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus, but they are not specific for PCT.
(B) C-reactive protein is a marker of inflammation and is not specific for PCT.
(C) Anti-hemidesmosome titers are not associated with PCT.
(E) Tzanck smear is used to diagnose herpes simplex virus infections, but it is not specific for PCT.",
"A 64-year-old man presents with severe respiratory distress. This has onset over the past 3 weeks, progressively worsening. Past history involves congestive heart failure (CHF). Due to concerns of concurrent pneumonia, sputum studies are ordered. Microscopic examination of his sputum demonstrates heart failure cells (hemosiderin-containing macrophages). Which of the following cellular organelles is significant in the formation of these cells?
Options:
(A): Endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
(B): Ribosomes
(C): Lysosomes
(D): Golgi apparatus
(E): Mitochondria
",Lysosomes,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Lysosomes.

Explanation:
Heart failure cells, also known as hemosiderin-containing macrophages, are formed as a result of the breakdown of red blood cells in the alveoli of the lungs. In congestive heart failure (CHF), there is increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, leading to leakage of red blood cells into the alveoli. These red blood cells are then engulfed by macrophages.

Lysosomes are cellular organelles that contain enzymes responsible for the breakdown of cellular waste and foreign substances. In the case of heart failure cells, lysosomes play a significant role in the breakdown of the engulfed red blood cells, releasing the iron-containing pigment called hemosiderin. This pigment gives the macrophages their characteristic appearance under microscopic examination.

The other organelles listed in the options are not directly involved in the formation of heart failure cells. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved in protein synthesis and lipid metabolism. Ribosomes are responsible for protein synthesis. The Golgi apparatus is involved in the modification, sorting, and packaging of proteins. Mitochondria are responsible for energy production in the cell. While these organelles are important for cellular function, they are not directly involved in the formation of heart failure cells.",
"A previously healthy 52-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after sustaining burns over 45% of her body in a house fire. On arrival, she is in acute distress but is fully oriented. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is begun and the patient is transferred to the intensive care unit of a burn center. 20 hours later, she has several large, tarry black stools and develops hypotension and tachycardia. Despite appropriate lifesaving measures, she dies. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the patient's tarry black stools?
Options:
(A): Decreased prostaglandin synthesis
(B): Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole
(C): Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum
(D): Decreased gastric blood flow
(E): Increased stomach acid production
",Decreased gastric blood flow,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Decreased gastric blood flow.

The patient's presentation of tarry black stools, hypotension, and tachycardia is consistent with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The most likely underlying cause of this bleeding in this patient is decreased gastric blood flow.

Burn injuries can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract due to a combination of factors, including hypovolemia, hypotension, and vasoconstriction. This decreased blood flow can result in ischemia and damage to the gastric mucosa, leading to bleeding.

The tarry black stools, known as melena, are caused by the digestion of blood in the gastrointestinal tract. The black color is due to the breakdown of hemoglobin by digestive enzymes and bacteria.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms:
(A) Decreased prostaglandin synthesis: Decreased prostaglandin synthesis would not directly cause acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
(B) Erosion of tortuous submucosal arteriole: While arteriole erosion can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, it is not the most likely cause in this patient with burns and decreased gastric blood flow.
(C) Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum: Bacterial colonization of the gastric antrum would not directly cause acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
(E) Increased stomach acid production: Increased stomach acid production would not directly cause acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to his primary care provider after feeling sad and depressed for the past several months. His wife divorced him about 6 months ago and took the kids and moved out of state. Since then he has had difficulty waking up in the morning and getting to work on time. He takes some comfort in food and has gained about 9.1 kg (20 lb). He eats out several times a week and sometimes consumes 2 whole meals in one sitting. Other than this new obsession with eating large quantities of food and excess sleeping he no longer enjoys doing things he liked doing in the past. Besides eating and sleeping he is always excited to see his children and looks forward to their visits. He says it's the one thing keeping him going. Additionally, he does not feel like he has the same drive or focuses at work. He reports that he has no interest in hurting himself or others. His blood pressure is 119/81 mm Hg, pulse rate is 85/min, respiratory rate is 12/min, and the temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F). His physical exam is normal. What other symptom is most likely present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Leaden paralysis
(B): Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning
(C): Psychotic features
(D): Stereotypies
(E): Mania
",Leaden paralysis,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (B) Depressive symptoms that are worse in the morning.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing symptoms consistent with major depressive disorder. He has been feeling sad and depressed for several months, has difficulty waking up in the morning, and has lost interest in activities he previously enjoyed. These symptoms are characteristic of depression. Additionally, the patient's increased appetite and weight gain, as well as excessive sleeping, are also common symptoms of depression. The fact that he looks forward to seeing his children and finds comfort in their visits suggests that he still experiences pleasure in some aspects of his life, which is consistent with depression rather than other mood disorders such as mania. The absence of psychotic features, stereotypies, or leaden paralysis further supports the diagnosis of major depressive disorder.",
"A 35-year-old man comes to the emergency department with acute shortness of breath that developed after a 10-hour international flight. His pulse is 124/min and pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 90%. He weighs 50-kg (110-lb). A diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is suspected and intravenous heparin is initiated. If the volume of distribution of heparin is equivalent to 60 mL/kg and the target peak plasma concentration is 0.5 units/mL, which of the following is the most appropriate loading dose for this patient?
Options:
(A): 3,000 units
(B): 1,500 units
(C): 6,000 units
(D): Cannot be calculated, as bioavailability is not known
(E): 30 units
","1,500 units",Correct,"The correct choice is (B) 1,500 units.

Explanation:
To calculate the loading dose of heparin, we need to use the formula:
Loading dose = Volume of distribution x Target peak plasma concentration

Given that the volume of distribution of heparin is 60 mL/kg and the patient weighs 50 kg, the volume of distribution for this patient would be:
Volume of distribution = 60 mL/kg x 50 kg = 3000 mL

Next, we need to convert the volume of distribution from mL to units. Since 1 mL of heparin is equivalent to 1000 units, the volume of distribution in units would be:
Volume of distribution in units = 3000 mL x 1000 units/mL = 3,000,000 units

Finally, we can calculate the loading dose by multiplying the volume of distribution in units by the target peak plasma concentration:
Loading dose = 3,000,000 units x 0.5 units/mL = 1,500,000 units

Therefore, the most appropriate loading dose for this patient would be 1,500 units.",
"A 45-year-old man presents to a surgeon with painless swelling over his right leg. He noticed the swelling 6 months ago, but he ignored it because it was painless. However, he is now concerned as the swelling has been increasing in size over the last 6 months. He also mentions that his father and brother have lipomas over the extremities. On physical examination, the swelling is well-circumscribed and non-tender, measuring approximately 4 x 5 cm. After evaluation, the surgeon performs a surgical resection of the tumor and sends the tissue for histopathological examination. The pathologist reports the tumor to be a liposarcoma rather than a lipoma. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to show increased activity in the cells of this patient’s tumor?
Options:
(A): Alkaline phosphatase
(B): DNase
(C): RNase
(D): Superoxide dismutase
(E): Telomerase
",Telomerase,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Telomerase.

Explanation:
Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from adipose tissue. It is characterized by the presence of atypical lipoblasts, which are immature fat cells. Unlike lipomas, which are benign tumors of adipose tissue, liposarcomas have the potential to invade surrounding tissues and metastasize.

Telomerase is an enzyme that is responsible for maintaining the length of telomeres, which are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten with each cell division, and when they become critically short, cells enter a state of senescence or undergo apoptosis. However, telomerase can prevent telomere shortening by adding repetitive DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes, allowing cells to continue dividing indefinitely.

Increased telomerase activity is a characteristic feature of many cancer cells, including liposarcomas. By maintaining the length of telomeres, telomerase allows cancer cells to bypass the normal limits on cell division and achieve immortality. Therefore, in this patient with a liposarcoma, increased telomerase activity is most likely to be observed in the cells of the tumor.",
"A 24-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician for a wellness visit. She says that she has been generally healthy but has noticed difficulty concentrating, becoming increasingly fatigued, and a 15-pound weight increase over the course of a few months. She also reports mild constipation and joint pain. Approximately 6-months ago, she experienced palpitations, increased stool frequency, and a hand tremor. Her past medical history is significant for asthma. Her father is not living and had Parkinson disease, and her mother has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis. She is currently sexually active in a monogamous relationship and uses contraception consistently. She denies cigarette smoking and occasionally drinks wine. She experimented once with lysergic acid diethylamide 6 years ago. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), blood pressure is 127/98 mmHg, pulse is 55/min, and respirations are 13/min. On physical exam, the patient has slow speech and movement. She has tenderness to palpation of her wrist and ankle joints. She has delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. Which of the following will most likely be found in this patient?
Options:
(A): Elevated TSH
(B): High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score
(C): Improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration
(D): Positive anti-CCP antibodies
(E): Positive urine toxicology
",Elevated TSH,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Elevated TSH.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, the most likely diagnosis is hypothyroidism. The patient presents with difficulty concentrating, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, joint pain, and slow speech and movement, which are all consistent with hypothyroidism. The presence of delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes further supports this diagnosis.

The most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of hypothyroidism is to measure the patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level. In primary hypothyroidism, which is the most common cause of hypothyroidism, the TSH level is typically elevated as the pituitary gland tries to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone. Therefore, an elevated TSH level is expected in this patient.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's presentation:
(B) High Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score: The PHQ-9 is a screening tool for depression, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient.
(C) Improved symptoms with carbidopa/levodopa administration: Carbidopa/levodopa is used to treat Parkinson's disease, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient.
(D) Positive anti-CCP antibodies: Anti-CCP antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.
(E) Positive urine toxicology: The patient's history does not suggest recent drug use, and her symptoms and physical exam findings are not consistent with drug intoxication.",
"A 3466-g (7-lb, 10-oz) female newborn is delivered at 38 weeks' gestation to a 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1. Apgar scores are 7 and 8, at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. The mother has a history of schizophrenia and was treated with lithium until 5 weeks' gestation, when she found out that she was pregnant. The mother was treated for alcohol abuse disorder 2 years ago. She has been sober for 14 months now. Examination shows that the child has micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, and small, low-set ears. Examination of the mouth shows a cleft palate. A grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur can be heard over the left sternal border. Echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. Further evaluation is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum
(B): Double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray
(C): Chromosome 5p deletion on FISH studies
(D): Elongated tricuspid valve leaflets on echocardiography
(E): Bilateral cataracts on ocular examination
",Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Low levels of parathyroid hormone in serum.

The clinical presentation described in the question is consistent with DiGeorge syndrome, also known as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. This genetic disorder is characterized by a deletion at chromosome 22q11.2, which results in a wide range of clinical features.

The child in the question has several characteristic features of DiGeorge syndrome, including micrognathia, a broad nasal bridge, a short philtrum, small, low-set ears, and a cleft palate. These facial abnormalities are commonly seen in individuals with this syndrome.

In addition to the facial abnormalities, the child also has a grade 3/6 systolic ejection murmur and echocardiography shows a single overriding great vessel arising from the heart. These cardiac findings are consistent with a congenital heart defect called tetralogy of Fallot, which is commonly associated with DiGeorge syndrome.

One of the key features of DiGeorge syndrome is hypoparathyroidism, which is characterized by low levels of parathyroid hormone in the serum. This can lead to hypocalcemia and its associated symptoms, such as muscle cramps, seizures, and tetany. Therefore, further evaluation of this child is most likely to show low levels of parathyroid hormone in the serum.

The other options listed are not consistent with the clinical presentation of DiGeorge syndrome. The double bubble sign on abdominal x-ray is seen in duodenal atresia, which is not associated with this syndrome. Chromosome 5p deletion is seen in cri-du-chat syndrome, which has a different clinical presentation. Elongated tricuspid valve leaflets and bilateral cataracts are not commonly associated with DiGeorge syndrome.",
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician after discovering a painless mass in the left testicle. Results from tumor markers and a biopsy are as follows:
AFP 350 ng/mL (normal value < 10 ng/mL)
hCG 0.4 IU/L (normal value < 0.5 IU/L)
Biopsy: Presence of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells.
What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Classic seminoma
(B): Choriocarcinoma
(C): Teratoma
(D): Embryonal carcinoma
(E): Yolk sac tumor
",Yolk sac tumor,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Yolk sac tumor.

Explanation:
The elevated AFP level of 350 ng/mL in this patient suggests the presence of a yolk sac tumor. Yolk sac tumors are the most common malignant testicular tumors in children and are characterized by elevated AFP levels. The histologic findings of glomeruli-like structures with a central capillary within a mesodermal core, lined by flattened layers of germ cells, are consistent with yolk sac tumor. Classic seminoma is characterized by large cells with clear cytoplasm and central nuclei, and it typically does not secrete AFP. Choriocarcinoma is characterized by cytotrophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts, and it typically secretes hCG. Teratomas are composed of multiple germ cell layers and can contain various types of tissue, but they typically do not secrete AFP. Embryonal carcinoma is characterized by undifferentiated cells with marked cytologic atypia, and it can secrete AFP and/or hCG, but it is less likely in this case given the low hCG level.",
"An 80-year-old man presents with severe pain of the right lower extremity. He says that symptoms had an acute onset while he was in the ICU for a COPD exacerbation due to a recent upper respiratory infection, which was treated with nebulized albuterol and ipratropium bromide, continuous oxygen, IV methylprednisolone, and levofloxacin. He says he has been hospitalized 3 other times this year for COPD exacerbations. The medical history is significant for a left main coronary artery myocardial infarction after a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 2 months ago, mild cognitive impairment, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications are metformin, aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, atorvastatin, galantamine, and enalapril. He reports a 40-pack-year smoking history but quit 10 years ago. His temperature is 39.0°C (102.5°F); blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg; pulse is 122/min; respiratory rate is 20/min, and oxygen saturation is 88% on room air. The physical examination is significant for the cutaneous finding shown in the picture. The involved area is severely tender to palpation and there are warmth and crepitus. A foul-smelling discharge is also noted. Pain seems out of proportion to the exam findings. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): High-dose IV dexamethasone
(B): Immediate debridement
(C): Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics
(D): Biopsy of wound
(E): Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen
",Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Immediate debridement and empiric IV antibiotics.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection that can lead to tissue necrosis and systemic toxicity. The severe pain, acute onset, warmth, crepitus, foul-smelling discharge, and out-of-proportion pain are all suggestive of this diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention.

Immediate debridement is the first step in management. This involves surgical removal of all necrotic tissue and exploration of the affected area to assess the extent of the infection. Debridement allows for better visualization of the infected tissue and helps to control the spread of the infection.

Empiric IV antibiotics should also be initiated immediately. Broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover both aerobic and anaerobic organisms should be used, such as vancomycin plus piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by local resistance patterns and the patient's individual risk factors.

High-dose IV dexamethasone (option A) is not indicated in the management of necrotizing fasciitis. While corticosteroids may have a role in reducing inflammation and improving outcomes in some infections, there is no evidence to support their use in necrotizing fasciitis.

Biopsy of the wound (option D) is not necessary for the diagnosis or management of necrotizing fasciitis. The clinical presentation and physical examination findings are sufficient to make the diagnosis and guide management.

Contrast CT of the chest and abdomen (option E) may be useful in some cases to evaluate for the source of infection or to assess for complications such as abscess formation or gas in the soft tissues. However, in this patient with a clear clinical diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, immediate surgical intervention is the priority and should not be delayed for imaging studies.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents to the emergency department after losing consciousness at work. On presentation, she is found to be somnolent though she is able to be woken by vocal stimuli. She says that over the last 12 hours, she has been experiencing muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, and hallucinations. She says that the symptoms started after she went on a hike in the woods and foraged from plants along the way. Physical exam reveals dry red skin and enlarged pupils. Her bladder is also found to be completely full though she says she is unable to urinate. Which of the following drugs would most likely be administered to this patient to treat her symptoms?
Options:
(A): Atropine
(B): Physostigmine
(C): Pralidoxime
(D): Pyridostigmine
(E): Neostigmine
",Physostigmine,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Physostigmine.

The patient's symptoms, including muscle spasms, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, dry red skin, enlarged pupils, and urinary retention, are consistent with anticholinergic toxicity. Anticholinergic toxicity can occur from ingestion of certain plants, such as those the patient foraged from during her hike in the woods.

Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that can be used as the specific antidote for anticholinergic toxicity. It works by increasing the levels of acetylcholine in the central nervous system, which helps to counteract the effects of anticholinergic drugs. Physostigmine can reverse troublesome central anticholinergic symptoms, including delirium, hallucinations, and urinary retention.

Atropine, option (A), is an anticholinergic drug and would exacerbate the patient's symptoms. Pralidoxime, option (C), is used as an antidote for organophosphate poisoning, not anticholinergic toxicity. Pyridostigmine, option (D), and neostigmine, option (E), are both cholinesterase inhibitors, but they are not typically used in the treatment of anticholinergic toxicity. Physostigmine is the preferred choice in this scenario.",
"A 34-year-old woman presents to the plastic surgery office 3 months following a rhinoplasty procedure. The patient has been recovering well. However, she has noticed a small whistling noise when she respires through her nose, which you appreciate on physical exam. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this phenomenon?
Options:
(A): Post-operative swelling
(B): A septal hematoma causing a perforation
(C): A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow
(D): Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow
(E): A fracture of the bony septum
",A septal hematoma causing a perforation,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): A septal hematoma causing a perforation.

Explanation:
A septal hematoma causing a perforation is the most likely cause of the small whistling noise when the patient respires through her nose. Septal ulcers and perforations can occur as a complication of nasal surgery, such as rhinoplasty. The whistling noise is a characteristic symptom of a small perforation in the septum. 

Post-operative swelling (option A) may cause nasal congestion and difficulty breathing, but it is not typically associated with a whistling noise. 

A deviated septum that is now straight, resulting in altered nasal airflow (option C) may cause nasal obstruction, but it would not cause a whistling noise. 

Excessive columellar show resulting in increased nasal airflow (option D) refers to the excessive visibility of the columella (the strip of tissue between the nostrils) and would not cause a whistling noise. 

A fracture of the bony septum (option E) may cause nasal obstruction and deformity, but it would not cause a whistling noise.",
"A 43-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-day history of rash on the trunk and lower extremities. Three days ago, she visited a spa resort with multiple swimming pools and whirlpools. A friend of hers who also visited the spa has developed a similar rash. She does not smoke or drink alcohol and takes no medications. She appears well. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows multiple erythematous, excoriated papules and pustules over the trunk and upper thighs. The inflammation seen in this patient's condition most likely originated in which of the following parts of the skin?
Options:
(A): Superfical epidermis
(B): Hair follicles
(C): Sebaceous glands
(D): Papillary dermis
(E): Eccrine sweat glands
",Hair follicles,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Hair follicles.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of multiple erythematous, excoriated papules and pustules over the trunk and upper thighs is consistent with folliculitis, which is inflammation of the hair follicles. Folliculitis can occur when bacteria, fungi, or viruses infect the hair follicles, leading to inflammation and the formation of papules and pustules. In this case, the patient's exposure to swimming pools and whirlpools at the spa resort likely contributed to the development of folliculitis. The warm and moist environment of these facilities can promote the growth of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, which commonly causes folliculitis. Additionally, the patient's friend developing a similar rash after visiting the same spa suggests a shared source of infection. Therefore, the inflammation seen in this patient's condition most likely originated in the hair follicles.",
"A 19-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of severe right shoulder pain and inability to move the shoulder after a fall while climbing outdoors. Examination shows the right upper extremity is externally rotated and slightly abducted. There is loss of the the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder. The right humeral head is palpated below the coracoid process. Sensation to pinprick over which of the following skin areas is most likely to be reduced?
Options:
(A): Medial aspect of the upper arm
(B): Lateral aspect of the shoulder
(C): Skin above the clavicle
(D): Lateral aspect of forearm
(E): Dorsal aspect of forearm and hand
",Lateral aspect of the shoulder,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Lateral aspect of the shoulder.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the patient's presentation is consistent with an anterior shoulder dislocation. An anterior shoulder dislocation occurs when the humeral head is displaced anteriorly from the glenoid fossa. This can result in injury to the axillary nerve, which innervates the deltoid muscle and provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the shoulder.

In this case, the patient's inability to move the shoulder, external rotation and abduction of the right upper extremity, and palpation of the humeral head below the coracoid process all suggest an anterior shoulder dislocation. The loss of the normal rounded appearance of the shoulder further supports this diagnosis.

The axillary nerve also provides sensation to the lateral aspect of the shoulder. Therefore, it is likely that sensation to pinprick over the lateral aspect of the shoulder would be reduced in this patient.

The other options (A, C, D, and E) are not innervated by the axillary nerve and would not be affected by an anterior shoulder dislocation.",
"A 25-year-old girl is brought to the emergency room after a suicide attempt. Her mother states that she found a large empty pill bottle next to her. The patient is conscious and tearful. She is currently complaining of severe abdominal pain but refuses to give any other history. She has a blood pressure of 135/86, respiratory rate of 18/min, and heart rate of 86/min. On examination, her abdomen is exquisitely tender with evidence of crepitus in the epigastric region. Abdominal CT reveals a gastric perforation. Which of the following is the most likely cause?
Options:
(A): Decreased production of PGE2
(B): Buildup of a toxic metabolite due to kidney disease
(C): Increased stimulation of the vagus nerve
(D): Direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation
(E): Hypovolemia
",Decreased production of PGE2,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Decreased production of PGE2.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with severe abdominal pain, tenderness, and evidence of crepitus in the epigastric region, along with the finding of a gastric perforation on abdominal CT, is consistent with a diagnosis of gastric perforation. Gastric perforation is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention.

The most likely cause of gastric perforation in this case is decreased production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 is an important mediator of gastric mucosal defense and plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the gastric mucosa. It helps to regulate gastric acid secretion, increase blood flow to the gastric mucosa, and promote the secretion of protective mucus.

In this case, the patient's suicide attempt involved the ingestion of a large number of pills, which likely included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs inhibit the production of PGE2 by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is responsible for the synthesis of prostaglandins, including PGE2. The decreased production of PGE2 leads to a disruption of the gastric mucosal defense mechanisms, making the stomach more susceptible to injury and perforation.

The other options are less likely to be the cause of gastric perforation in this case. Buildup of a toxic metabolite due to kidney disease (option B) would not directly cause gastric perforation. Increased stimulation of the vagus nerve (option C) may lead to increased gastric acid secretion, but it is not a common cause of gastric perforation. Direct irritation of the stomach lining causing inflammation (option D) may cause gastritis or gastric ulcers, but it is less likely to cause a gastric perforation. Hypovolemia (option E) may lead to ischemia of the gastric mucosa, but it is not a common cause of gastric perforation.",
"A 32-year-old male presents to the ED with acute-onset chest pain. His blood pressure is 157/90 mmHg and his his pulse is 116/min. He appears anxious and agitated and a careful exam reveals dilated pupils and a perforated nasal septum. An EKG reveals ST segment elevation so he is urgently taken for cardiac intervention. Upon review, this patient reveals that he has not had care from a physician since he graduated from college. In the interim he has been largely unemployed and admits that he has recently been homeless. When asked directly, the patient admits to alcohol and marijuana use but denies illicit drug use. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the agent most likely responsible for this patient's presentation?
Options:
(A): Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine
(B): Inhibiting breakdown of biogenic amines
(C): Antagonizing the NMDA receptor
(D): Activating the acetylcholine receptor
(E): Inhibiting the GABA receptor
",Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Blocking reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with cocaine intoxication. Cocaine is a potent stimulant that blocks the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in the brain. This leads to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft, resulting in the characteristic effects of cocaine, including increased sympathetic activity, vasoconstriction, and increased heart rate and blood pressure. The patient's dilated pupils and perforated nasal septum are also consistent with chronic cocaine use.",
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of difficulty falling asleep for the past 2 months. She wakes up frequently during the night and gets up earlier than desired. She experiences discomfort in her legs when lying down at night and feels the urge to move her legs. The discomfort resolves when she gets up and walks around or moves her legs. She has tried an over-the-counter sleep aid that contains diphenhydramine, which worsened her symptoms. She exercises regularly and eats a well-balanced diet. She admits that she has been under a lot of stress lately. Her brother has similar symptoms. The patient appears anxious. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. A complete blood count and iron studies are within the reference range. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Amitryptiline
(B): Pramipexole
(C): Codeine
(D): Propranolol
(E): Escitalopram
",Pramipexole,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Pramipexole.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and discomfort in the legs that is relieved by movement, are consistent with restless legs syndrome (RLS). RLS is a neurological disorder characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations. The symptoms typically worsen at night and can significantly disrupt sleep.

Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that has been shown to be effective in treating RLS. It works by stimulating dopamine receptors in the brain, which helps to alleviate the symptoms of RLS. Other dopamine agonists, such as ropinirole, are also commonly used for RLS.

Amitriptyline (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that can be used for the treatment of insomnia, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms. It is not specifically indicated for RLS and may not effectively relieve the discomfort in the legs.

Codeine (C) is an opioid analgesic that is not indicated for the treatment of RLS. It may provide some pain relief, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms.

Propranolol (D) is a beta-blocker that is primarily used for the treatment of hypertension and certain cardiac conditions. It is not indicated for the treatment of RLS and would not effectively relieve the symptoms described by the patient.

Escitalopram (E) is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is commonly used for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. While anxiety may be a contributing factor to the patient's symptoms, escitalopram is not the most appropriate choice for the treatment of RLS.",
"A 55-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department because of worsening upper abdominal pain for the past 8 hours. She reports that the pain radiates to her back and is associated with nausea. She has hypertension and hyperlipidemia, for which she takes enalapril, furosemide, and simvastatin. Her temperature is 37.5°C (99.5°F), blood pressure is 84/58 mm Hg, and pulse is 115/min. The lungs are clear to auscultation. Examination shows abdominal distention with epigastric tenderness and guarding. Bowel sounds are decreased. Extremities are warm. Laboratory studies show:
Hematocrit 48%
Leukocyte count 13,800/mm3
Platelet count 175,000/mm3
Serum  
Calcium 8.0 mg/dL
Urea nitrogen 32 mg/dL
Amylase 250 U/L
An ECG shows sinus tachycardia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's vital sign abnormalities?
Options:
(A): Abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis
(B): Capillary leakage
(C): Decreased cardiac output
(D): Increased excretion of water
(E): Pseudocyst formation
",Capillary leakage,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Capillary leakage.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with acute pancreatitis, which is characterized by severe upper abdominal pain that radiates to the back, nausea, and vomiting. The physical examination findings of abdominal distention, epigastric tenderness, and guarding further support this diagnosis. The laboratory findings of elevated hematocrit, leukocytosis, and elevated amylase are also consistent with acute pancreatitis.

In acute pancreatitis, the release of inflammatory mediators leads to increased capillary permeability and leakage of fluid into the interstitial space. This capillary leakage can result in hypovolemia and subsequent hypotension, as seen in this patient. The decreased blood pressure (84/58 mm Hg) and tachycardia (115/min) are signs of hypovolemic shock.

The other options are not the most likely underlying cause of the patient's vital sign abnormalities:
(A) Abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis: While abnormal coagulation and fibrinolysis can occur in acute pancreatitis, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's vital sign abnormalities.
(C) Decreased cardiac output: While decreased cardiac output can occur in severe cases of acute pancreatitis, it is not the most likely cause of the patient's vital sign abnormalities.
(D) Increased excretion of water: Increased excretion of water would not explain the patient's hypotension and tachycardia.
(E) Pseudocyst formation: Pseudocyst formation is a complication of chronic pancreatitis and would not explain the acute presentation and vital sign abnormalities seen in this patient.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician for evaluation because his parents have been concerned by a number of troubling signs. Specifically, they have noticed that he has been exhibiting aggressive behavior as well as hyperactivity. In addition, he has had intellectual disability and is slow to hit developmental milestones. Physical exam reveals coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness. Eye exam reveals no abnormalities of the cornea or lens. Based on these findings, the patient is referred to a geneticist for further evaluation. Which of the following substances would most likely accumulate in the cells of this patient?
Options:
(A): Cerebroside sulfate
(B): Galactocerebroside
(C): Glucocerebroside
(D): Heparan sulfate
(E): Sphingomyelin
",Heparan sulfate,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Heparan sulfate.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is presenting with signs and symptoms consistent with a lysosomal storage disorder known as mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS). MPS is characterized by the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in various tissues and organs due to a deficiency in lysosomal enzymes responsible for their degradation.

In this case, the patient's physical exam findings of coarse facies, short stature, and joint stiffness, along with developmental delay and intellectual disability, are suggestive of MPS. The specific type of MPS cannot be determined based on the information provided, but the accumulation of heparan sulfate is most likely.

Heparan sulfate is a type of GAG that is normally degraded by the enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate in lysosomes, resulting in the clinical manifestations seen in MPS.

The other options listed (A) Cerebroside sulfate, (B) Galactocerebroside, (C) Glucocerebroside, and (E) Sphingomyelin are not associated with MPS. Cerebroside sulfate accumulation is seen in metachromatic leukodystrophy, galactocerebroside accumulation is seen in Krabbe disease, glucocerebroside accumulation is seen in Gaucher disease, and sphingomyelin accumulation is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.",
"A 21-year-old man with a past medical history significant for Down syndrome presents to the outpatient primary care clinic for a routine follow up and high risk screening. He is relatively high functioning and currently has no additional significant medical conditions. He feels well and a physical examination shows that he is within normal limits. He denies any current tobacco use, alcohol use, or illicit drug use. His vital signs include: temperature, 36.7°C (98.0°F); blood pressure, 126/74 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; and respiratory rate, 17/min. When considering possible conditions for which this patient is predisposed, which of the following neoplasms is associated with Down syndrome?
Options:
(A): Gastric adenocarcinoma
(B): Astrocytoma and cardiac rhabdomyoma
(C): Hepatocellular carcinoma
(D): Esophageal adenocarcinoma
(E): Acute lymphocytic leukemia
",Acute lymphocytic leukemia,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Explanation:
Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing certain neoplasms, and one of the most common neoplasms seen in individuals with Down syndrome is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Down syndrome is associated with an estimated 20-fold increased risk of developing ALL compared to the general population. Other neoplasms that have been associated with Down syndrome include acute myeloid leukemia (AML), solid tumors such as neuroblastoma and retinoblastoma, and testicular germ cell tumors. However, ALL is the most commonly observed neoplasm in individuals with Down syndrome.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents to the office because she has felt a small painless mass in her neck which has been slowly growing. She has no relevant past medical history. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On physical exam of the thyroid gland, a solitary nodule is palpated. It is fixed to the surrounding tissues and nontender. TSH is normal, and antithyroid antibodies are negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Endemic goiter
(B): Follicular carcinoma
(C): Graves’ disease
(D): Hashimoto thyroiditis
(E): Papillary carcinoma
",Papillary carcinoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Papillary carcinoma.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of a painless, slowly growing solitary nodule in the thyroid gland, along with the findings of fixation to surrounding tissues and negative antithyroid antibodies, is highly suggestive of papillary carcinoma. Papillary carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer and typically presents as a solitary nodule in the thyroid gland. It is more common in women and tends to occur in younger individuals. The nodule is usually painless and slowly growing. On physical examination, the nodule may be fixed to the surrounding tissues, which is a concerning finding for malignancy. TSH levels are typically normal in papillary carcinoma. Antithyroid antibodies are negative because papillary carcinoma is not an autoimmune condition. Therefore, based on the patient's presentation and the given information, papillary carcinoma is the most likely cause of her symptoms.",
"A 4-year-old boy presents to the pediatrician’s office. His mother complains that he has been sleeping poorly, and she has noticed that he often scratches his perianal area. A scotch tape test is found to be positive and mebendazole is prescribed. Into which of the following subsets have the naïve T cells (TH0) developed due to the infection in this patient?
Options:
(A): TH1 cells
(B): TH2 cells
(C): TH17
(D): T0 cells
(E): TREGS
",TH2 cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) TH2 cells.

Explanation:
The presentation of a positive scotch tape test and the symptoms of poor sleep and perianal itching suggest that the patient has a parasitic infection, most likely pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis). The treatment with mebendazole further supports this diagnosis.

In response to parasitic infections, the immune system activates specific subsets of T cells to mount an appropriate immune response. In the case of helminth infections, such as pinworms, the immune response is primarily mediated by TH2 cells.

TH2 cells are responsible for promoting humoral immunity and activating eosinophils, which are important in the defense against helminth infections. They produce cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, which stimulate B cells to produce antibodies and recruit eosinophils to the site of infection.

Therefore, in this patient, the naïve T cells (TH0) have developed into TH2 cells in response to the parasitic infection.",
"A 69-year-old right-handed man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. On questioning, he has had some difficulty speaking for 3 months. During a conversation, he often has difficulty repeating what his interlocutor has said. He has hypertension and takes hydrochlorothiazide. His vital signs are within normal limits. The patient speaks fluently in full sentences and demonstrates normal comprehension. When asked to say the word “kindergarten,” he replies with, “Sintelmarvin… no, that's wrong…kinterflargin, no that isn't it either...kantolargen...no? How about, kindergarten?” The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is occlusion of a branch of which of the following arteries?
Options:
(A): Left middle cerebral
(B): Right vertebral
(C): Left posterior inferior cerebellar
(D): Left posterior cerebral
(E): Left penetrating
",Left middle cerebral,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Left middle cerebral.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of difficulty speaking and repeating words suggest a language impairment known as conduction aphasia. Conduction aphasia is typically caused by a lesion in the arcuate fasciculus, a white matter tract that connects Broca's area (responsible for speech production) with Wernicke's area (responsible for language comprehension). The arcuate fasciculus is located in the dominant hemisphere, which is usually the left hemisphere in right-handed individuals.

The left middle cerebral artery supplies blood to the dominant hemisphere, including the areas involved in language processing. Therefore, occlusion of a branch of the left middle cerebral artery is the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The other options (B, C, D, and E) involve arteries that do not directly supply the language areas and are less likely to be responsible for the patient's symptoms.",
"An investigator is studying the frequency of polycythemia in a population of a remote, mountainous region. A representative sample of 100 men shows a normal distribution of hemoglobin concentration with a mean concentration of 17 g/dL and a standard error of 0.1 g/dL. Which of the following best represents the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL?
Options:
(A): 30%
(B): 15%
(C): 95%
(D): 99%
(E): 5%
",15%,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) 15%.

Explanation:
To determine the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL, we need to calculate the z-score and then find the corresponding probability using a standard normal distribution table.

The z-score is calculated using the formula:
z = (x - μ) / σ
where x is the value we want to find the probability for (18 g/dL), μ is the mean (17 g/dL), and σ is the standard error (0.1 g/dL).

z = (18 - 17) / 0.1
z = 10

Using a standard normal distribution table, we can find that the probability of a z-score of 10 or greater is approximately 0.15 or 15%.

Therefore, the probability that a subject will have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 18 g/dL is 15%.",
"A 57-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of fatigue. She also reports generalized itchiness that started approximately 2 months ago. Two weeks ago, she noticed yellowing of her eyes. She does not smoke or drink alcohol. She uses eyedrops for persistent dryness of the eyes. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows jaundice of the conjunctivae and skin. The mucous membranes of the mouth are dry. The abdomen is soft. The liver edge is palpable 3 cm below the right costal margin.

Ultrasonography of the abdomen shows mildly increased echogenicity of the liver. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be found in this patient?""
Options:
(A): Inferior vena cava thrombosis
(B): Cutaneous xanthomas
(C): Butterfly-shaped vertebrae
(D): Increased CA 19-9 levels
(E): Kayser-Fleischer rings
""
",Cutaneous xanthomas,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Cutaneous xanthomas.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, as well as the laboratory studies and ultrasonography results, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). PBC is a chronic autoimmune liver disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and liver injury.

Cutaneous xanthomas are a common finding in patients with PBC. Xanthomas are yellowish deposits of cholesterol and lipids that accumulate in the skin and tendons. They are typically seen in areas with increased friction or pressure, such as the elbows, knees, and buttocks. Cutaneous xanthomas are a result of the abnormal lipid metabolism seen in PBC.

Inferior vena cava thrombosis (A) is not associated with PBC. It is more commonly seen in conditions such as liver cirrhosis or malignancy.

Butterfly-shaped vertebrae (C) are a characteristic finding in patients with ankylosing spondylitis, not PBC.

Increased CA 19-9 levels (D) are associated with pancreatic cancer, not PBC.

Kayser-Fleischer rings (E) are seen in Wilson disease, a genetic disorder characterized by impaired hepatic copper transport. They are not typically seen in PBC.",
"A 32-year-old pregnant woman presents to her physician with flu-like symptoms for the past 3 days. She has a runny nose, mild headache, and feels achy. She has a mild fever and diffuse rash over her body. She is concerned about the health of her baby and wants to know if there are any medications that will make her feel better in a short time. Currently, she is at her 29th week of gestation and has received the tetanus vaccination as part of the antenatal care program she received since she immigrated at the end of her first trimester from Romania. She is otherwise healthy. Considering this patient, she is at a higher risk of giving birth to a newborn who will present with which of the following options?
Options:
(A): Single S2
(B): Wide pulse pressure
(C): Brachial-femoral delay
(D): Double split S2
(E): Tricuspid valve regurgitation
",Wide pulse pressure,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Wide pulse pressure.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the pregnant woman is presenting with flu-like symptoms, including a mild fever and diffuse rash. These symptoms, along with the fact that she received the tetanus vaccination during her pregnancy, suggest that she may have contracted rubella, also known as German measles.

Rubella is a viral infection that can cause flu-like symptoms, including fever and rash. It is particularly concerning during pregnancy because it can lead to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) in the developing fetus. CRS can cause a wide range of birth defects, including heart abnormalities.

One of the cardiac manifestations of CRS is a wide pulse pressure. Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings. A wide pulse pressure indicates increased arterial compliance, which can be seen in conditions such as aortic regurgitation or patent ductus arteriosus. In the context of CRS, it is likely due to the involvement of the heart valves, leading to abnormalities in the blood flow.

Therefore, the pregnant woman in this scenario is at a higher risk of giving birth to a newborn who will present with a wide pulse pressure as a result of congenital rubella syndrome.",
"An investigator is studying bacterial adaptations to the environment in an infectious isolate and a noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B. Animals exposed to the noninfectious isolate do not develop symptoms of infection. The investigator cultivates the noninfectious isolate in a culture with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. Some of the animals exposed to these bacteria develop symptoms of infection. Which of the following processes is most likely responsible for the described findings?
Options:
(A): Conjugation
(B): Reassortment
(C): Transformation
(D): Generalized transduction
(E): Recombination
",Transformation,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Transformation.

Explanation:
Transformation is the process by which bacteria take up free DNA from their environment and incorporate it into their own genome. In this scenario, the noninfectious isolate of Hemophilus influenzae type B is able to acquire DNA from the infectious isolate through transformation when it is cultured with lysed bacteria from the infectious isolate. This acquired DNA may contain genes that are responsible for the infectious properties of the bacteria, leading to the development of symptoms of infection in some of the animals exposed to these transformed bacteria.

Conjugation involves the transfer of DNA between bacteria through direct cell-to-cell contact, which is not described in this scenario.

Reassortment is a process that occurs in viruses with segmented genomes, where genetic material is exchanged between different strains of the same virus. This process is not applicable to bacteria.

Generalized transduction is a process where bacterial DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage. This process is not described in this scenario.

Recombination is a general term that refers to the exchange of genetic material between different DNA molecules. While transformation can be considered a type of recombination, it is more specific to the uptake of free DNA from the environment.",
"A 40-year-old female with a past medical history of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, hyperthyroidism, and asthma presents to the primary care clinic today. She has tried several different statins, all of which have resulted in bothersome side effects. Her current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, levothyroxine, albuterol, oral contraceptives, and a multivitamin. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Her blood pressure is 116/82 mm Hg and her heart rate is 82/min. You decide to initiate colesevelam (Welchol). Of the following, which is a concern with the initiation of this medication?
Options:
(A): Colesevelam can cause significant flushing and itching.
(B): Colesevelam can cause cognitive impairment.
(C): Colesevelam can increase the risk of cholelithiasis.
(D): Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications.
(E): Colesevelam can significantly decrease your HDL.
",Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications.,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient’s other medications.

Explanation:
Colesevelam is a bile acid sequestrant used to decrease elevated serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations in the management of primary hypercholesterolemia. It works by binding to bile acids in the intestine, preventing their reabsorption and promoting their excretion in the feces. 

One concern with the initiation of colesevelam is the timing of dosing. Bile acid sequestrants, including colesevelam, can interfere with the absorption of other drugs, such as thiazides, beta-blockers, warfarin, digoxin, and thyroxine. To minimize this interaction, it is recommended to administer colesevelam at least 4 hours before or 1 hour after other medications. This allows for adequate absorption of the other medications and prevents any potential decrease in their effectiveness.

Therefore, the timing of the dosing of colesevelam should be separated from this patient's other medications to ensure optimal absorption and effectiveness of all the medications she is taking.",
"A 62-year-old patient with a history of deep venous thrombosis is enrolled in a clinical trial for a new oral anticoagulant. This novel drug has the property where its clearance is relatively predictable based on patient demographics and can easily be extrapolated from other data. Its metabolism and volume of distribution also do not change dramatically from patient to patient. The investigator wants to make sure that the plasma concentration of the drug in this patient is 15 mg/L and he knows the following drug characteristics.

Bioavailability: 50%
Drug half-life: 2 hours
Volume of distribution: 14.3 liters

Which of the following represents the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours?
Options:
(A): 150 milligrams
(B): 430 milligrams
(C): 600 milligrams
(D): 1200 milligrams
(E): 3600 milligrams
",1200 milligrams,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): 1200 milligrams.

Explanation:
To calculate the maintenance dose, we need to use the formula:

Maintenance dose = (desired plasma concentration × clearance × dosing interval) / bioavailability

Given information:
Desired plasma concentration = 15 mg/L
Clearance = (dose / bioavailability) / half-life
Dosing interval = 8 hours
Bioavailability = 50%
Half-life = 2 hours

First, let's calculate the clearance:
Clearance = (dose / bioavailability) / half-life
Clearance = (dose / 0.5) / 2
Clearance = 2 × dose

Now, let's substitute the values into the formula:
Maintenance dose = (15 mg/L × 2 × dose × 8 hours) / 0.5
Maintenance dose = 240 mg × dose

To achieve a plasma concentration of 15 mg/L, the maintenance dose should be 240 mg × dose. Since we want to find the dose, we can rearrange the equation:
Dose = Maintenance dose / 240 mg

Substituting the given dosing options into the equation:
(A) Dose = 150 mg / 240 mg = 0.625
(B) Dose = 430 mg / 240 mg = 1.792
(C) Dose = 600 mg / 240 mg = 2.5
(D) Dose = 1200 mg / 240 mg = 5
(E) Dose = 3600 mg / 240 mg = 15

The only option that gives a whole number for the dose is (D): 1200 milligrams. Therefore, the maintenance dose that should be given to this patient every 8 hours is 1200 milligrams.",
"A 7-day-old infant boy presents to an emergency department due to poor feeding. His parents are recent immigrants to the United States. He was born in a traditional home birth and has never seen a medical provider. Mom had no prenatal care, has no medical issues, and is unvaccinated. The baby had been breastfeeding well until 24 hours ago when mom noticed he started having trouble latching. In the last 12 hours, he has completely refused to feed. He has had a decreased number of wet diapers and has stooled twice in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), pulse is 180/min, respirations are 52/min, and blood pressure is 70/50 mmHg. On exam, the infant has increased tone, a clenched jaw, no head lag, and clenched hands. Initial screening bloodwork is normal. What is the most likely organism causing this infant's presentation?
Options:
(A): Clostridium botulinum
(B): Clostridium tetani
(C): Escherichia coli
(D): Group B streptococcus
(E): Listeria monocytogenes
",Clostridium tetani,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Clostridium tetani.

Explanation:
The presentation of poor feeding, decreased urine output, and constipation in a 7-day-old infant with increased tone, clenched jaw, and clenched hands is consistent with neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which produces a neurotoxin that affects the central nervous system. The infection occurs through contamination of the umbilical stump, which is common in traditional home births without proper sterile techniques. The initial symptoms of neonatal tetanus include poor feeding, irritability, and muscle stiffness. As the disease progresses, the muscle stiffness becomes more severe, leading to generalized muscle spasms and rigidity. Other signs of neonatal tetanus include a clenched jaw (trismus), increased muscle tone (hypertonia), and clenched hands (carpopedal spasm). The absence of head lag is also a characteristic finding in neonatal tetanus. The diagnosis of neonatal tetanus is primarily clinical, and there is no specific laboratory test for the disease. Treatment involves supportive care, including wound care, control of muscle spasms, and administration of tetanus immunoglobulin and antibiotics.",
"A 28-year-old woman presents with facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea for the past month. She denies any history of smoking, alcohol use, or recreational drug use. The patient was on a trip to Thailand 2 years ago with her family but denies any recent travel. Her blood pressure is 120/88 mm Hg, pulse is 78/min, temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), and respiratory rate is 16/min. Laboratory findings are unremarkable, except for a potassium level of 3.3 mmol/L and serum calcium of 11 mg/dL. The attending physician suspects that this might be a case of a genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 and orders a genetic analysis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Vibrio cholera infection
(B): VIPoma
(C): Rotavirus
(D): Campylobacter jejuni
(E): Somatostatinoma
",VIPoma,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) VIPoma.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of facial flushing, weakness, and chronic diarrhea, along with the laboratory findings of hypokalemia (low potassium) and hypercalcemia (high calcium), are consistent with the diagnosis of VIPoma. VIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to the characteristic symptoms of watery diarrhea, facial flushing, and electrolyte abnormalities. The genetic mutation in the menin 1 gene on chromosome 11 is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), which increases the risk of developing VIPomas. The patient's history of travel to Thailand 2 years ago is not relevant to the current presentation, as VIPomas are not typically associated with travel-related infections. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is VIPoma.",
"A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his primary care physician for pain in his right shoulder. The patient was helping his son move this past weekend, and he noticed after the move that he had pain and weakness in his right shoulder. The patient thought that this pain was just him being in poor shape so he started going to the gym and lifting weights which made his symptoms significantly worse. The patient has a past medical history of diabetes, obesity, and asthma. His current medications include albuterol, lisinopril, metformin, and glipizide. On physical exam you note an obese gentleman who seems to be in pain. You note prominent weakness of external rotation of his right upper extremity. When you ask the patient to slowly lower his right arm to his side when he holds it overhead, you note that he suddenly drops his arm and appears to be in pain. The patient's strength is 1/5 for abduction of the right arm. Which of the following is most likely injured in this patient?
Options:
(A): Supraspinatus
(B): Infraspinatus
(C): Teres minor
(D): Subscapularis
(E): Deltoid
",Supraspinatus,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Supraspinatus.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely injured structure in this patient is the supraspinatus muscle. The patient's pain and weakness in the right shoulder following a strenuous activity, such as helping his son move, suggests an acute injury. The fact that the patient's symptoms worsened with weightlifting at the gym further supports this. 

The supraspinatus muscle is one of the four rotator cuff muscles located in the shoulder. It is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm and stabilizing the shoulder joint. Weakness in external rotation and abduction, as well as pain with lowering the arm from an overhead position (known as the ""drop arm test""), are classic signs of supraspinatus muscle injury.

The other muscles listed in the options (B: Infraspinatus, C: Teres minor, D: Subscapularis, E: Deltoid) are also part of the rotator cuff, but they do not match the patient's clinical presentation. Infraspinatus and teres minor are primarily responsible for external rotation of the arm, while subscapularis is responsible for internal rotation. The deltoid muscle is responsible for abduction of the arm, but it is not specifically associated with the symptoms described in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely injured structure in this patient is the supraspinatus muscle.",
"A 9-year-old male visited his primary care physician for a check-up three months after a throat infection. Upon examination, the patient exhibits painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities. Which of the following symptoms is most likely to also be present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Renal failure
(B): Hepatomegaly
(C): Chorea
(D): Pleural effusion
(E): Butterfly rash
",Chorea,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Chorea.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of painless subcutaneous nodules on the back of the wrist, the outside elbow, and the front of the knees, as well as inflammation in the joints of the lower extremities, is consistent with a condition called rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever is a systemic inflammatory disease that can occur after an untreated or inadequately treated group A streptococcal infection, such as a throat infection.

Chorea is a characteristic symptom of rheumatic fever. It is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary, purposeless, and jerky movements of the limbs, face, and trunk. These movements are often described as ""dance-like"" or ""writhing"" and can be mild or severe. Chorea typically affects the patient's ability to perform fine motor tasks and can be associated with emotional lability and difficulty concentrating.

Renal failure (option A) is not typically associated with rheumatic fever. However, rheumatic fever can lead to a complication called acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, which can cause renal dysfunction. However, renal failure itself is not a common symptom of rheumatic fever.

Hepatomegaly (option B) is not a typical symptom of rheumatic fever. Rheumatic fever primarily affects the heart, joints, skin, and central nervous system, and does not typically involve the liver.

Pleural effusion (option D) is not a typical symptom of rheumatic fever. Pleural effusion refers to the accumulation of fluid in the pleural space surrounding the lungs and is not commonly associated with rheumatic fever.

Butterfly rash (option E) is not a typical symptom of rheumatic fever. A butterfly rash is a characteristic rash seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease. While both rheumatic fever and SLE are autoimmune diseases, they have different clinical manifestations, and a butterfly rash is not typically seen in rheumatic fever.",
"A 29-year-old man diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago presents for follow-up to discuss his medication. The patient was diagnosed with schizophrenia 4 years ago and has since tried several antipsychotic medications, none of which have been able to treat his negative symptoms. He has changed to clozapine 2 weeks ago and says that he does feel better. His physical exam is unremarkable, and he is responding appropriately to questioning. If this patient’s current medication is to be continued, which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered at this time?
 
Options:
(A): Slit-lamp examination
(B): Electrocardiogram
(C): Prolactin level
(D): Complete blood count
(E): Thyroid-stimulating hormone level
",Complete blood count,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Complete blood count.

Explanation:
When a patient is on clozapine, it is important to monitor their complete blood count (CBC) regularly. This is because clozapine can cause a potentially serious side effect called agranulocytosis, which is a severe decrease in white blood cell count. Agranulocytosis can increase the risk of infections, so it is important to monitor the patient's white blood cell count regularly to detect any abnormalities.

In this case, the patient has recently started taking clozapine and is feeling better. However, it is still necessary to monitor his CBC to ensure that his white blood cell count remains within a safe range. If the white blood cell count drops significantly, it may be necessary to discontinue the medication or adjust the dosage.

The other options listed (A) Slit-lamp examination, (B) Electrocardiogram, (C) Prolactin level, and (E) Thyroid-stimulating hormone level are not specifically indicated for monitoring patients on clozapine. Slit-lamp examination is used to assess the eyes and is not directly related to the side effects of clozapine. Electrocardiogram is used to monitor the heart's electrical activity and is not specifically indicated for clozapine monitoring. Prolactin level and thyroid-stimulating hormone level are used to assess hormonal imbalances and are not directly related to the side effects of clozapine.",
"A 32-year-old man with HIV comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of weight loss, night sweats, and productive cough. Auscultation of the lungs shows coarse crackles at the right upper posterior field. An x-ray of the chest shows an opacity in the right upper lobe. Sputum analysis shows acid-fast bacilli. A small amount of tuberculin fluid is injected into the subcutaneous tissue on the left forearm. Examination of the injected area 48 hours later shows no induration or erythema. Impairment of which of the following processes is the most likely cause of the negative tuberculin skin test seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Secretion of interferon-α
(B): Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands
(C): Opsonization by complement proteins
(D): Secretion of interleukin-4
(E): Generation of reactive oxygen species
",Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Interaction of B7 and CD28 ligands.

Explanation:
In this patient with HIV, the negative tuberculin skin test is most likely due to impairment of the interaction between B7 and CD28 ligands. This interaction is necessary for the activation of T cells, specifically CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in the immune response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In HIV infection, there is a progressive decline in CD4+ T cell count, leading to impaired immune function. As the CD4+ T cell count decreases, the ability to mount an immune response against tuberculosis diminishes, resulting in a negative tuberculin skin test.

Secretion of interferon-α (A) is involved in the antiviral response and is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.

Opsonization by complement proteins (C) is part of the immune response against bacteria, but it is not directly involved in the tuberculin skin test.

Secretion of interleukin-4 (D) is involved in the Th2 immune response and is not directly related to the tuberculin skin test.

Generation of reactive oxygen species (E) is part of the immune response against pathogens, but it is not directly involved in the tuberculin skin test.",
"A 7-year-old boy is rushed to the emergency room after losing consciousness 30 mins ago at home. The patient’s mother says that he has had a “running nose” for the past few days However, he did not receive any treatment for it, and his condition rapidly worsened today. He does not have any significant past medical history. His vaccination records are up to date. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.7°F), blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, and respiratory rate is 22/min. On physical examination, the patient is unresponsive. There is a petechial rash present on his chest, and he has some neck rigidity. Empiric intravenous antibiotics are started, and a lumbar puncture is performed. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s low blood pressure?
Options:
(A): Miliary tuberculosis
(B): Human immunodeficiency virus infection
(C): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(D): Adrenocortical insufficiency
(E): Pheochromocytoma
",Adrenocortical insufficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Adrenocortical insufficiency.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with low blood pressure, which is indicated by a blood pressure reading of 90/50 mm Hg. Adrenocortical insufficiency, also known as adrenal crisis or Addisonian crisis, is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate production or release of adrenal hormones, particularly cortisol. Cortisol is a hormone that helps regulate blood pressure and responds to stress. In patients with adrenocortical insufficiency, the lack of cortisol can lead to hypotension (low blood pressure).

The patient's symptoms, such as a running nose, rapid worsening of condition, unresponsiveness, petechial rash, and neck rigidity, are consistent with meningococcal meningitis, which is a common cause of adrenal crisis in children. Meningococcal meningitis is an infection caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis, which can lead to sepsis and adrenal crisis.

Therefore, in this case, the most likely cause of the patient's low blood pressure is adrenocortical insufficiency due to meningococcal meningitis. Prompt treatment with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care is crucial in managing this life-threatening condition.",
"A chronic opioid abuser undergoes emergency surgery. Following the operation, the man is started on a patient controlled analgesia (PCA) thought to be dosed adequately to control his pain in the face of his opioid tolerance. He reports intense pain 6 hours after the conclusion of the surgery. Which agent could have been given intraoperatively to reduce this patient's risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia?
Options:
(A): Ketamine
(B): Thiopental
(C): Midazolam
(D): Propofol
(E): Etomidate
",Ketamine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Ketamine.

Explanation:
Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist that has been shown to have analgesic properties and can help reduce the risk of developing postoperative hyperalgesia in chronic opioid abusers. Chronic opioid use can lead to increased sensitivity to pain, known as hyperalgesia, which can make postoperative pain management challenging. Ketamine works by blocking the NMDA receptors in the brain, which helps prevent the development of hyperalgesia.

Thiopental, midazolam, propofol, and etomidate are all sedative agents commonly used in anesthesia, but they do not have the same analgesic properties as ketamine. Therefore, they would not be effective in reducing the risk of postoperative hyperalgesia in this patient.",
"A 3550-g (7.8-lb) male newborn is delivered at term to a 27-year-old, gravida 1, para 1 woman (Rh+). Within the first 24 hours after birth, the newborn develops fever and a yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae. Examination shows loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis. Laboratory studies show decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels. A photomicrograph of a peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione
(B): Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen
(C): Point mutation in β-globin
(D): Deficiency of ATP
(E): Osmotically fragile erythrocytes
",Deficiency of ATP,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Deficiency of ATP.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of fever, yellow discoloration of skin and sclerae, loss of flexion in the extremities, splenomegaly, and cyanosis, along with laboratory findings of decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels, are consistent with hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to red blood cell (RBC) membrane defects. In this case, the most likely cause of the RBC membrane defect is a deficiency of ATP.

ATP is required for the maintenance of RBC membrane integrity and function. ATP is necessary for the activity of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump, which maintains the normal ionic gradient across the RBC membrane. Deficiency of ATP leads to impaired ion transport, resulting in increased intracellular sodium and calcium levels and decreased intracellular potassium levels. This leads to cellular swelling, loss of RBC membrane flexibility, and increased susceptibility to hemolysis.

The decreased haptoglobin levels and increased LDH levels seen in this patient are consistent with hemolysis. Haptoglobin is a protein that binds free hemoglobin released from lysed RBCs, and its decreased levels indicate increased hemolysis. LDH is an enzyme found in high levels in RBCs, and its increased levels indicate increased RBC destruction.

The other options are not likely involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition:
(A) Decrease in the reduced form of glutathione: Glutathione is an antioxidant that helps protect RBCs from oxidative damage. Decreased levels of reduced glutathione can lead to oxidative stress and hemolysis, but this is not the most likely cause in this case.
(B) Maternal antibodies against the rhesus D antigen: This would cause Rh incompatibility and hemolysis in subsequent pregnancies, but the patient in this case is a gravida 1, para 1 woman, so this is not the most likely cause.
(C) Point mutation in β-globin: This would cause a hemoglobinopathy, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, but the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient are not consistent with a hemoglobinopathy.
(E) Osmotically fragile erythrocytes: This would cause increased susceptibility to hemolysis in response to osmotic stress, but the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient are not consistent with osmotic fragility.",
"A 37-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with confusion, anxiety, sweating, and episodes of vomiting. She is accompanied by her sister who says that her symptoms developed acutely and is unsure about what caused it. She is currently on methimazole, which she last took approximately 1 week ago. Approximately 5 days ago she developed an upper respiratory infection managed with bed rest and ibuprofen. Her temperature is 105°F (40.6°C), blood pressure is 95/68 mmHg, pulse is 145/min, and respirations are 23/min. On physical examination, the patient has altered mentation and is agitated and diaphoretic. The patient also has a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and a hand tremor. She is started on intravenous fluids. Which of the following is the best treatment option for this patient?
Options:
(A): Antibiotics
(B): Carotid massage
(C): Clonazepam
(D): Epinephrine
(E): Propranolol
",Propranolol,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Propranolol.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including confusion, anxiety, sweating, vomiting, and altered mentation, are consistent with thyroid storm, which is a life-threatening condition caused by excessive release of thyroid hormones. The patient's history of taking methimazole and having a goiter, exophthalmos, warm skin, and hand tremor further support this diagnosis.

Propranolol is the best treatment option for this patient because it is a nonselective beta-blocker that can rapidly control the sympathetic symptoms of thyroid storm, such as tachycardia, hypertension, and tremor. It works by blocking the effects of thyroid hormones on the beta-adrenergic receptors. By reducing sympathetic stimulation, propranolol can help stabilize the patient's vital signs and improve her symptoms.

Antibiotics (option A) are not indicated in this case because the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of an infection. Carotid massage (option B) is not appropriate because it can lead to complications such as carotid dissection or stroke. Clonazepam (option C) is a benzodiazepine that may help with anxiety and agitation, but it does not address the underlying thyroid storm. Epinephrine (option D) is contraindicated in thyroid storm because it can worsen the symptoms by increasing sympathetic stimulation.",
"A 13-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he was vomiting and seemed abnormally sleepy at home. On presentation, he is found to be confused and very lethargic. His parents said that he has had a fever and cough for several days prior to presentation and was given an over the counter medication. Physical exam of this patient reveals mild hepatomegaly and dry mucous membranes. Which of the following effects would the drug most likely also have on the nephron?
Options:
(A): Constriction of afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole
(B): Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole
(C): Dilation of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole
(D): No effect on afferent arteriole and constriction of efferent arteriole
(E): No effect on afferent arteriole and dilation of efferent arteriole
",Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Constriction of afferent arteriole and no effect on efferent arteriole.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, it is likely that the drug he was given over the counter is causing acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI can be caused by various factors, including medications. The drug in question is most likely causing renal vasoconstriction, leading to decreased blood flow to the kidneys.

The afferent arteriole supplies blood to the glomerulus, where filtration occurs. Constriction of the afferent arteriole would decrease the blood flow into the glomerulus, resulting in decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This can lead to impaired kidney function and the accumulation of waste products in the body.

On the other hand, the efferent arteriole carries blood away from the glomerulus. In this scenario, the drug does not have an effect on the efferent arteriole. This means that the blood leaving the glomerulus is not affected, and there is no change in the resistance or constriction of the efferent arteriole.

Overall, the drug is causing constriction of the afferent arteriole, leading to decreased blood flow to the glomerulus and impaired kidney function. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of confusion, lethargy, and dry mucous membranes, which are signs of dehydration and electrolyte imbalances associated with AKI.",
"A 54-year-old woman presents with sudden onset, mild vaginal bleeding for the past day. She says she is postmenopausal, and her last menstrual period was 5 years ago. A detailed workup is performed, and several premalignant lesions are found in her uterus. The patient agrees to a hysterectomy. The surgical team decides to use an anesthesia protocol consisting of nitrous oxide, desflurane, and atracurium. Which of the following best describes the role of atracurium in this patient’s anesthesia?
Options:
(A): It reduces neuron and muscle tissue excitability
(B): It increases GABA linked chloride channel opening
(C): It acts on the pain centers in the spinal cord and brain
(D): It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction
(E): It persistently depolarizes the cholinergic receptors on the motor end plate
",It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): It competes with acetylcholine for binding sites in the neuromuscular junction.

Explanation:
Atracurium is a neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) that is commonly used during anesthesia to induce muscle relaxation. It works by competitively binding to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction, preventing the binding of acetylcholine and inhibiting muscle contraction. This leads to muscle relaxation, which is important during surgical procedures to facilitate intubation, improve surgical access, and prevent patient movement.

Option (A) is incorrect because atracurium does not directly reduce neuron and muscle tissue excitability. It acts specifically at the neuromuscular junction to block muscle contraction.

Option (B) is incorrect because atracurium does not affect GABA-linked chloride channel opening. GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and atracurium does not have any direct effect on GABA receptors.

Option (C) is incorrect because atracurium does not act on the pain centers in the spinal cord and brain. Its primary mechanism of action is at the neuromuscular junction, not in the central nervous system.

Option (E) is incorrect because atracurium does not persistently depolarize the cholinergic receptors on the motor end plate. It competitively binds to these receptors, preventing depolarization and muscle contraction.",
"A 22-year-old woman presents with recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck with occasional abdominal pain. The symptoms usually resolve in 2 to 3 days. She has had these swelling events her whole life; however, they have become more debilitating recently. Last week she had an event that restricted her ability to eat and swallow.  Past medical history is noncontributory. Her father is alive and well with no significant medical history. Her mother and her maternal aunt have a similar condition. Today, her physical exam is within normal limits. She brought a picture of her swollen hand as seen in the picture. The treating physician has a strong suspicion of an inherited disorder. C1-inhibitor levels are ordered and found to be extremely low. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of this patient?
Options:
(A): DiGeorge syndrome
(B): Chediak-Higashi syndrome
(C): Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
(D): Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
(E): Hereditary angioedema
",Hereditary angioedema,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Hereditary angioedema.

Explanation:
The patient's recurrent episodes of swelling in her face, hands, and neck, along with occasional abdominal pain, are consistent with angioedema. The fact that her symptoms have been present her whole life and have become more debilitating recently, along with a family history of a similar condition, suggests an inherited disorder. The low C1-inhibitor levels confirm the diagnosis of hereditary angioedema.

DiGeorge syndrome (A) is a genetic disorder characterized by the deletion of a portion of chromosome 22. It typically presents with congenital heart defects, immune deficiencies, and facial abnormalities. This syndrome does not cause recurrent episodes of swelling.

Chediak-Higashi syndrome (B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by partial albinism, recurrent infections, and neurological abnormalities. It does not cause recurrent episodes of swelling.

Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (C) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent infections. It does not cause recurrent episodes of swelling.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (D) is a rare acquired disorder characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, leading to episodes of hemoglobinuria. It does not cause recurrent episodes of swelling.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is hereditary angioedema (E), which is characterized by recurrent episodes of swelling in various parts of the body, including the face, hands, and neck, along with occasional abdominal pain.",
"A 24-year-old woman gravida 2, para 1 at 24 weeks' gestation comes to the physician for a prenatal visit. She feels well. Her earlier pregnancy was uncomplicated. This is her 4th prenatal visit. She had an ultrasound scan 2 weeks ago that showed a live intrauterine pregnancy consistent with a 22-week gestation with no anomalies. She had a normal Pap smear 2 years ago. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows a uterus consistent in size with a 24-week gestation. Her blood group and type is B positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Oral glucose challenge test
(B): Cardiotocography
(C): Rh antibody testing
(D): Swab for GBS culture
(E): Tdap vaccination
",Oral glucose challenge test,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Oral glucose challenge test.

Explanation:
The most appropriate next step in management for this patient is an oral glucose challenge test. This test is used to screen for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), which is a common complication of pregnancy. GDM is defined as glucose intolerance that is first recognized during pregnancy. It is important to screen for GDM because it can lead to adverse outcomes for both the mother and the fetus if left untreated.

In this case, the patient is at 24 weeks' gestation, which is the recommended time for GDM screening according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines. The patient has no known risk factors for GDM, but screening is still recommended for all pregnant women. The oral glucose challenge test involves giving the patient a 50-gram glucose solution and measuring her blood glucose level 1 hour later. If the blood glucose level is elevated (typically ≥140 mg/dL), further testing with a 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test is indicated to confirm the diagnosis of GDM.

The other options listed are not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient:
- (B) Cardiotocography is a test used to assess fetal well-being by monitoring the fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. It is typically performed later in pregnancy or in cases where there are concerns about fetal well-being. There is no indication for cardiotocography in this patient at this time.
- (C) Rh antibody testing is typically done earlier in pregnancy to determine if the mother is Rh-negative and at risk for Rh isoimmunization. This patient's blood group and type is B positive, so Rh antibody testing is not indicated.
- (D) Swab for GBS culture is typically done later in pregnancy (around 35-37 weeks' gestation) to screen for group B streptococcus (GBS) colonization. This patient is only at 24 weeks' gestation, so GBS culture is not indicated at this time.
- (E) Tdap vaccination is recommended during pregnancy to provide passive immunity to the newborn against pertussis. However, the timing of Tdap vaccination is typically later in pregnancy (between 27-36 weeks' gestation). This patient is only at 24 weeks' gestation, so Tdap vaccination is not indicated at this time.",
"A 42-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of dyspnea, chest pain, and hemoptysis that were preceded by 4 days of myalgia and a low-grade fever. He is currently visiting the United States as a tourist from Turkey, where he works at a factory that processes sheep wool and hide. An x-ray of the chest shows widening of the mediastinum. A sputum culture grows gram-positive rods in gray colonies that have irregular margins with wavy projections on microscopy. Which of the following virulence factors of the causal organism increased its survival in host tissue?
Options:
(A): Glutamate capsule
(B): Toxin B
(C): Protein A
(D): IgA protease
(E): Sulfatides
",Glutamate capsule,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Glutamate capsule.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, myalgia, and low-grade fever, along with the findings of widening of the mediastinum on chest x-ray, suggests a possible diagnosis of inhalation anthrax. Inhalation anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive rod. The gray colonies with irregular margins and wavy projections on microscopy are characteristic of B. anthracis.

One of the virulence factors of B. anthracis is the glutamate capsule. The capsule is composed of poly-D-glutamic acid and is a major factor in the pathogenesis of anthrax. The capsule helps the bacteria evade phagocytosis by host immune cells, such as macrophages. It also inhibits the formation of reactive oxygen species, which are part of the host's immune response. By increasing its survival in host tissue, the glutamate capsule contributes to the pathogenicity of B. anthracis.

Toxin B (choice B) is produced by Clostridium difficile and is not relevant to the pathogenesis of inhalation anthrax.

Protein A (choice C) is a virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus and is not relevant to the pathogenesis of inhalation anthrax.

IgA protease (choice D) is an enzyme produced by some bacteria, such as Neisseria meningitidis, that cleaves IgA antibodies. It is not relevant to the pathogenesis of inhalation anthrax.

Sulfatides (choice E) are glycolipids found in the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They are not relevant to the pathogenesis of inhalation anthrax.

Therefore, the correct answer is (A) Glutamate capsule.",
"A 27-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 38 weeks' gestation is admitted to the hospital for active labor. The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes and fetal weight is estimated to be at the 90th percentile for gestational age. During delivery, there is an arrest in the second stage of labor, and a vacuum-assisted delivery is performed. Postpartum examination shows a third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position. This patient is most likely to experience which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Urge incontinence
(B): Vesicovaginal fistula
(C): Fecal incontinence
(D): Small bowel obstruction
(E): Stress incontinence
",Fecal incontinence,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Fecal incontinence.

Explanation:
A third-degree laceration in the vagina extending into the perineum at the 6 o'clock position is a severe perineal tear that involves the anal sphincter complex. This type of tear can occur during a difficult delivery, such as in cases of vacuum-assisted delivery or prolonged second stage of labor. The anal sphincter complex consists of the internal and external anal sphincters, which are responsible for maintaining continence of stool. When these muscles are damaged, it can lead to fecal incontinence, which is the inability to control bowel movements. This can result in the involuntary passage of stool or gas. 

Urge incontinence (option A) is the sudden and strong urge to urinate, often followed by the involuntary loss of urine. This is not typically associated with a third-degree laceration.

Vesicovaginal fistula (option B) is an abnormal connection between the bladder and vagina, resulting in the continuous leakage of urine into the vagina. This is not typically associated with a third-degree laceration.

Small bowel obstruction (option D) is a blockage in the small intestine that can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. This is not typically associated with a third-degree laceration.

Stress incontinence (option E) is the involuntary loss of urine during activities that increase abdominal pressure, such as coughing, sneezing, or exercising. This is not typically associated with a third-degree laceration.",
"A 63-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for follow-up. He reports a slow and steady weight gain of 6 pounds over the past 6 months, despite attempts to control his diet and increase his level of exercise. His medications include pravastatin, lisinopril, and hydrochlorothiazide. On exam, his vital signs are stable. He is obese (BMI 32), and his waist circumference is 43 inches. His physician is concerned about an abnormal fasting blood glucose and dyslipidemia. On further work-up with oral glucose tolerance test, the patient is diagnosed with diabetes. Which of the following associations is consistent with this patient’s most likely form of diabetes?
Options:
(A): Strong HLA class II gene makeup
(B): Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition
(C): Pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration
(D): Auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens
(E): Unrelated to his abdominal obesity
",Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The risk factors for type 2 diabetes include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, family history, and certain genetic factors. In this patient, the presence of abdominal obesity (BMI 32, waist circumference 43 inches) and weight gain despite attempts to control diet and increase exercise suggest insulin resistance.

Pancreatic islet cell amyloid deposition is associated with type 2 diabetes. Amyloid deposition in the islets of Langerhans can lead to dysfunction and destruction of beta cells, which are responsible for producing insulin. This can contribute to the relative insulin deficiency seen in type 2 diabetes.

The other options are not consistent with this patient's most likely form of diabetes:
(A) Strong HLA class II gene makeup: While genetic factors can contribute to the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, there is no mention of a strong HLA class II gene makeup in this patient.
(C) Pancreatic islet cell leukocyte infiltration: This finding is more commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, where there is an autoimmune destruction of beta cells.
(D) Auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens: Again, this finding is more commonly associated with type 1 diabetes, where auto-antibodies against pancreatic islet cell antigens can be detected.
(E) Unrelated to his abdominal obesity: Abdominal obesity is a known risk factor for type 2 diabetes, so it is likely related to his diabetes in this case.",
"A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a right breast mass that she noticed 3 weeks ago. It has rapidly increased in size during this period. She does not have pain. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows large dense breasts; a 5-cm, nontender, multinodular mass is palpated in the right outer quadrant of the right breast. There are no changes in the skin or nipple. There is no palpable cervical or axillary adenopathy. Mammography shows a smooth polylobulated mass. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Intraductal papilloma
(B): Phyllodes tumor
(C): Fibroadenoma
(D): Fibrocystic disease of the breast
(E): Invasive lobular carcinoma
",Phyllodes tumor,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Phyllodes tumor.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is a phyllodes tumor. Phyllodes tumors are rare fibroepithelial tumors that typically occur in women in their 40s. They can rapidly increase in size, as seen in this patient, and are often associated with a palpable mass. On examination, phyllodes tumors are typically large, firm, and mobile masses. Mammography may show a smooth, well-circumscribed mass with lobulated margins, as seen in this case. Biopsy of the mass shows papillary projections of epithelial-lined stroma with hyperplasia and atypia, which is consistent with the histologic features of a phyllodes tumor. Intraductal papilloma is a benign breast lesion that typically presents with nipple discharge and is not associated with rapid growth. Fibroadenoma is a common benign breast tumor that typically occurs in younger women and is not associated with rapid growth. Fibrocystic disease of the breast is a benign condition characterized by fibrosis, cysts, and epithelial hyperplasia, but it does not typically present as a rapidly growing mass. Invasive lobular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that typically presents as a painless, palpable mass, but it does not typically have the characteristic mammographic findings seen in this case.",
"A 72-year-old Caucasian male presents to your office with dysphagia and halitosis. If this patient is also found to have cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction, which of the following is the most likely cause of his presenting symptoms?
Options:
(A): Gastroesophageal reflux disease
(B): Esophageal candidiasis
(C): Glossopharyngeal nerve damage
(D): Meckel's diverticulum
(E): Zenker's diverticulum
",Zenker's diverticulum,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Zenker's diverticulum.

Explanation:
Zenker's diverticulum is the most likely cause of the patient's presenting symptoms of dysphagia and halitosis in the context of cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction. Zenker's diverticulum is a pouch-like outpouching that occurs in the posterior pharyngeal wall, just above the cricopharyngeal muscle. It is typically associated with a noncompliant or hypertensive upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which consists of the cricopharyngeus muscle, inferior pharyngeal constrictor, and the cervical esophagus.

Patients with Zenker's diverticulum may experience dysphagia, which is difficulty swallowing, due to the outpouching obstructing the passage of food. Halitosis, or bad breath, can occur as a result of food stagnation and decomposition within the diverticulum. Other symptoms may include regurgitation of undigested food, a sensation of fullness in the neck, and coughing several minutes to hours after eating.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is not the most likely cause in this case. While GERD can cause dysphagia, it is typically associated with symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation of stomach acid, and chest pain. Esophageal candidiasis, which is a fungal infection of the esophagus, would not typically present with dysphagia and halitosis as the primary symptoms. Glossopharyngeal nerve damage and Meckel's diverticulum are not associated with cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction and would not explain the patient's symptoms.",
"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because he has not been able to walk since waking up that morning. His mother said that when he tried to get out of bed that he was unable to stand without support. He also complained of prickling in his hands and feet. Three weeks ago, he had a fever, dry cough, and a sore throat. The fever and sore throat subsided a week after they began, but the cough is persisting. He has no history of serious illness and takes no medication. His vital signs are within normal limits. The lungs are clear to auscultation. There is severe weakness in both lower extremities and mild sensory loss of the hands and feet. Knee and ankle jerk reflexes are absent. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 12.0 g/dL
Leukocyte count 6000/mm3

A lumbar puncture is performed; cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 2/mm3, a glucose concentration of 60 mg/dL, and a protein concentration of 91 mg/dL. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in treatment?""
Options:
(A): Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)
(B): Prednisone
(C): Botulism antitoxin
(D): Intravenous acyclovir
(E): Gabapentin
",Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG),Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an acute immune-mediated polyneuropathy characterized by ascending weakness and areflexia. The most appropriate next step in treatment for GBS is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) administration.

GBS is thought to be triggered by an antecedent infection, often a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection. In this case, the patient had a recent febrile illness with cough and sore throat, which is suggestive of a preceding viral or bacterial infection.

The clinical findings of severe weakness in both lower extremities, mild sensory loss, absent knee and ankle jerk reflexes, and normal vital signs are consistent with GBS. The lumbar puncture findings of elevated protein concentration (albuminocytologic dissociation) and normal glucose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid further support the diagnosis of GBS.

IVIG is the treatment of choice for GBS. It is thought to work by modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation. IVIG has been shown to shorten the duration of symptoms and improve outcomes in patients with GBS. It should be initiated as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made.

Prednisone is not indicated in the treatment of GBS. It may be used in other immune-mediated neuropathies, such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), but it is not the first-line treatment for GBS.

Botulism antitoxin is used in the treatment of botulism, a rare condition caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are not consistent with botulism.

Intravenous acyclovir is used in the treatment of viral infections, particularly herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are not consistent with a viral infection requiring acyclovir treatment.

Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant medication that is used to treat neuropathic pain and seizures. It is not indicated for the treatment of GBS.",
"A 27-year-old male presents to the psychiatrist requesting help with his compulsions as they are interfering with his life. He explains that he has this fear that something terrible will happen to his house if he does not check every appliance, outlet, window and door lock, faucet, and light fixture before he leaves. He states that he must check everything 7 times in a specific order and if he goes out of order he must start from the beginning and perform it all over. He has recently been fired from his job because he is always late and lost his fiancee as she could not deal with his habits anymore. The physician explained that cognitive-behavioral therapy may be of assistance and also prescribed clomipramine. Which of the following is the mechanism of reaction of clomipramine?
Options:
(A): Decreases the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin
(B): Increases the release of norepinephrine and serotonin by alpha 2 receptor antagonism
(C): Blocks only norepinephrine reuptake
(D): Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin
(E): Increases presynaptic release of norepinephrine and dopamine from vesicles
",Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Blocks reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin.

Explanation:
Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that is commonly used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Its mechanism of action involves blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin in the synaptic cleft, leading to increased levels of these neurotransmitters in the brain. This increased availability of norepinephrine and serotonin helps to alleviate the symptoms of OCD.

The other options are not correct:

(A): Decreases the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin - Clomipramine does not affect the degradation of norepinephrine and serotonin. Its primary mechanism of action is blocking their reuptake.

(B): Increases the release of norepinephrine and serotonin by alpha 2 receptor antagonism - Clomipramine does not directly increase the release of norepinephrine and serotonin. Its main effect is on reuptake inhibition.

(C): Blocks only norepinephrine reuptake - Clomipramine blocks the reuptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin, not just norepinephrine.

(E): Increases presynaptic release of norepinephrine and dopamine from vesicles - Clomipramine does not increase the presynaptic release of norepinephrine and dopamine. Its primary mechanism of action is reuptake inhibition.",
"A 35-year-old Caucasian female presents to the hospital alarmed by her recent truncal weight gain, facial hair growth, and thinning skin. During the physical exam, the physician finds that the patient is hypertensive. Serum analysis reveals hyperglycemia. The physician suspects a pituitary adenoma. Which dexamethasone test result would help confirm the physician's suspicions?
Options:
(A): Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, increased ACTH
(B): Low-dose, increased ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH
(C): Low-dose, decrease in ACTH; high-dose, no change in ACTH
(D): Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, no change in ACTH
(E): Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH
","Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH",Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Low-dose, no change in ACTH; high-dose, decreased ACTH.

Explanation:
In a patient suspected of having a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's syndrome, the dexamethasone test can help confirm the diagnosis. In this case, the low-dose dexamethasone test is used to assess the feedback inhibition of cortisol production by the pituitary gland. If the pituitary adenoma is present, it will continue to produce ACTH despite the administration of dexamethasone, resulting in no change in ACTH levels.

The high-dose dexamethasone test is used to differentiate between pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome (Cushing's disease) and other causes of Cushing's syndrome. In Cushing's disease, the pituitary adenoma is responsible for the excess ACTH production. Therefore, when high-dose dexamethasone is administered, the pituitary adenoma is suppressed, leading to a decrease in ACTH levels.

In summary, a low-dose dexamethasone test with no change in ACTH levels and a high-dose dexamethasone test with a decrease in ACTH levels would support the diagnosis of a pituitary adenoma causing Cushing's syndrome.",
"A 24-year-old man with chronic back pain comes to the physician to establish care after moving to Florida. He complains of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea for three days. He denies smoking, drinking alcohol, and using illicit drugs. He appears restless. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 110/min, and blood pressure is 150/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection. His abdominal exam shows diffuse mild tenderness. There is no rebound tenderness or guarding. His hemoglobin concentration is 14.5 g/dL, leukocyte count is 8,000/mm, and platelet count is 250,000/mm3; serum studies and urinalysis show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Lorazepam
(B): Naltrexone
(C): Methadone
(D): Morphine
(E): Naloxone
""
",Methadone,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Methadone.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with opioid withdrawal. The symptoms of anxiety, nausea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, and diarrhea, along with the physical findings of dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and piloerection, are classic signs of opioid withdrawal. The patient's chronic back pain suggests that he has been using opioids for pain management. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that can be used to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. It has a slower onset and longer duration of action compared to other opioids, making it an effective choice for maintenance therapy. Lorazepam (A) is a benzodiazepine that can be used to manage anxiety symptoms, but it does not address the underlying opioid withdrawal. Naltrexone (B) is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be used for relapse prevention in patients who have already undergone detoxification. Morphine (D) is an opioid analgesic and would not be appropriate for managing opioid withdrawal. Naloxone (E) is an opioid receptor antagonist used for acute opioid overdose reversal and would not be appropriate for managing opioid withdrawal.",
"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of cough and progressively worsening difficulty walking up the stairs in his apartment. He has noticed that it is easier for him to climb the stairs after he has exercised. He has also had a 4.6-kg (10.1-lb) weight loss over the past 6 months. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 35 years. Examination shows dry mucous membranes. The pupils are equal and react sluggishly to light. Muscle strength in the proximal lower extremity is initially 3/5 but increases to 5/5 after repeated muscle tapping. His achilles reflex is 1+. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Polymyalgia rheumatica
(B): Myasthenia gravis
(C): Dermatomyositis
(D): Hypothyroidism
(E): Lambert-Eaton syndrome
",Lambert-Eaton syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

Explanation:
Lambert-Eaton syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and other symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms of difficulty walking up the stairs and muscle weakness in the proximal lower extremity are consistent with Lambert-Eaton syndrome. Additionally, the improvement in muscle strength after repeated muscle tapping, known as the ""tapping phenomenon,"" is a characteristic feature of Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

The patient's history of smoking is also significant, as Lambert-Eaton syndrome is strongly associated with small cell lung cancer. The cough and weight loss in this patient raise suspicion for an underlying malignancy.

The examination findings of dry mucous membranes and sluggish pupillary reaction to light are consistent with autonomic dysfunction, which can occur in Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

The other options listed (Polymyalgia rheumatica, Myasthenia gravis, Dermatomyositis, and Hypothyroidism) do not fully explain the patient's symptoms and examination findings.",
"A 78-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. CT demonstrates a mass in the head of the pancreas, and biopsy is planned for the following day. The patient's daughter approaches you outside the room to request that the results of the biopsy not be shared with the patient. She asks that the results instead be shared with her and her brother, who is the patient's documented health care proxy. She explains that she and her brother have discussed the situation and decided that it is best to not inform the patient that she has cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biopsy the next morning confirms the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the best response to the patient's daughter's request?
Options:
(A): Ask the patient's son, the documented health care proxy, how he would like to handle the situation
(B): Inquire why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis
(C): Offer to explain the diagnosis to the patient without using the word ""cancer""
(D): Order an ethics consult to determine how to address the situation
(E): Tell the patient's daughter that the patient must be informed of the diagnosis
",Inquire why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Inquire why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis.

Explanation:
In this situation, it is important to understand the reasoning behind the daughter's request before making any decisions. By inquiring why the patient's daughter feels her mother should not be informed of the diagnosis, the medical assistant can gather more information about the family dynamics, the patient's preferences, and any potential concerns or fears that may be influencing the daughter's decision. This will allow for a more informed and compassionate approach to addressing the situation. It is important to respect the patient's autonomy and right to be informed about their own medical condition, but also to consider the family's perspective and the potential impact of the diagnosis on the patient's well-being.",
"A 59-year-old man presents to his primary care provider with fatigue. He has been seen in the emergency room 5 times in the past 2 years for acute alcohol intoxication. His past medical history is notable for diabetes mellitus and gout. He takes metformin, glyburide, and allopurinol. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 86/min, and respirations are 16/min. He is in no acute distress. A positive fluid wave is noted. The dorsal surface of the tongue is depapillated, and there are erythematous swollen patches at the oral commissures. A complete blood count and iron studies are reported below:

Hemoglobin: 12.1 g/dL
Hematocrit: 36%
Leukocyte count: 6,000/mm^3 with normal differential
Platelet count: 170,000/mm^3

Mean corpuscular volume: 70 um^3
Iron: 250 ug/dL
Ferritin: 300 ng/mL
Total iron binding capacity: 200 mcg/dL^3

Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient?
Options:
(A): Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits
(B): Erythrocytes lacking central pallor
(C): Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor
(D): Hypochromatic erythrocytes
(E): Inclusions of denatured hemoglobin
",Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Erythrocytes with a ring of relative pallor.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with alcohol-related macrocytic anemia. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is elevated at 70 um^3, indicating macrocytic anemia. This is commonly seen in chronic alcoholism due to impaired DNA synthesis and ineffective erythropoiesis. The alcohol inhibits the absorption of folate and vitamin B12, leading to megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow.

In megaloblastic anemia, the erythrocytes are larger than normal and have a ring of relative pallor. This is due to delayed maturation of the nucleus compared to the cytoplasm. The larger size of the erythrocytes is reflected in the elevated MCV.

Erythroblasts with mitochondrial iron deposits (choice A) are seen in sideroblastic anemia, which is characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and abnormal iron metabolism. This is not the most likely finding in this patient.

Erythrocytes lacking central pallor (choice B) are seen in hereditary spherocytosis, a condition characterized by spherical erythrocytes with decreased surface area and increased osmotic fragility. This is not the most likely finding in this patient.

Hypochromatic erythrocytes (choice D) are seen in iron deficiency anemia, where there is a decrease in the amount of hemoglobin in each erythrocyte. This is not the most likely finding in this patient, as the iron levels and iron studies are within normal range.

Inclusions of denatured hemoglobin (choice E) are seen in conditions such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. This is not the most likely finding in this patient, as there are no other clinical or laboratory findings to suggest these conditions.",
"A 75-year-old man becomes pulseless in the cardiac intensive care unit 48 hours after admission for ST-elevation myocardial infarction. His blood pressure is 50/20 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows a tachycardic irregular rhythm with erratic undulations, but no discernible P waves or QRS complexes. During immediate advanced cardiac life support, two attempts at defibrillation are made, after which the patient is given 1 mg of IV epinephrine. After another attempt at defibrillation, the patient remains pulseless and his blood pressure is 60/35 mm Hg. The ECG monitor shows no changes. Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Sotalol
(B): Amiodarone
(C): Epinephrine
(D): Dopamine
(E): Atropine
",Amiodarone,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Amiodarone.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient is experiencing pulseless electrical activity (PEA), which is a cardiac arrest rhythm characterized by the absence of a palpable pulse despite the presence of electrical activity on the ECG. PEA is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention.

The initial management of PEA involves high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the administration of epinephrine. In this case, the patient has already received 1 mg of IV epinephrine, but there has been no improvement in the pulse or blood pressure.

The next step in management should be the administration of an antiarrhythmic medication. Amiodarone is the most appropriate choice in this situation. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to treat various types of arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. It has been shown to improve survival in patients with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia.

Sotalol is also a class III antiarrhythmic medication, but it is not the best choice in this scenario because it is primarily used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, not ventricular arrhythmias.

Epinephrine has already been administered and has not resulted in a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), so it would not be the most appropriate next step.

Dopamine is a vasopressor that can be used to increase blood pressure in patients with hypotension, but it is not indicated for the treatment of PEA.

Atropine is primarily used for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, not for the management of PEA.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is the administration of amiodarone.",
"A 65-year-old man presents with left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision. The diplopia is more prominent on his left-side lateral gaze. He denies having fever, headache, ocular pain, lacrimation, changes in color vision, or limb weakness. He has a past medical history of type-2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and ischemic heart disease. In addition, he had an ischemic stroke 9 years ago, from which he recovered completely with physiotherapy and rehabilitation. He has a history of a 56-pack-year cigarette smoking habit. His medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, glimepiride, metformin, metoprolol, and ramipril. The mental status examination is unremarkable. His muscle strength is normal in all 4 limbs. His sensations are decreased on his left side, including his face. The examination of extraocular movements is shown in the image. A lesion in which of the following locations explains the findings during eye examination?
Options:
(A): Cavernous sinus
(B): Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation
(C): Dorsal column-medial lemniscus
(D): Frontal eye field
(E): Medial longitudinal fasciculus
",Medial longitudinal fasciculus,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Medial longitudinal fasciculus.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of left-sided numbness, diplopia, and blurring of vision, along with the examination findings of decreased sensations on the left side and abnormal extraocular movements, are consistent with a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF).

The MLF is a bundle of nerve fibers that connects the cranial nerve nuclei responsible for eye movement control. It is involved in coordinating eye movements, particularly during horizontal gaze. Lesions in the MLF can result in internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), which is characterized by impaired adduction of the affected eye on lateral gaze, along with nystagmus of the contralateral abducting eye. This is known as ""one-and-a-half syndrome.""

In this case, the patient's diplopia is more prominent on left-side lateral gaze, indicating impaired adduction of the left eye. This suggests a lesion in the MLF on the left side. The MLF is located in the brainstem, specifically in the pons.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and examination findings:
(A) Cavernous sinus: Lesions in the cavernous sinus typically present with multiple cranial nerve deficits, including ophthalmoplegia, facial numbness, and sensory loss.
(B) Corticospinal tract before pyramidal decussation: Lesions in the corticospinal tract before the pyramidal decussation would result in contralateral weakness, not the symptoms described in the patient.
(C) Dorsal column-medial lemniscus: Lesions in the dorsal column-medial lemniscus would result in loss of proprioception and discriminative touch, but not the symptoms described in the patient.
(D) Frontal eye field: Lesions in the frontal eye field would result in impaired voluntary horizontal gaze, but not the symptoms described in the patient.",
"A 5-day-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of poor feeding, irritability, and noisy breathing. The mother did not receive any prenatal care. His respirations are 26/min. Physical examination shows sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of the disease process in this patient?
Options:
(A): Decreased release of acetylcholine
(B): Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels
(C): Destruction of Schwann cells
(D): Decreased release of glycine
(E): Destruction of anterior horn cells
",Decreased release of glycine,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Decreased release of glycine.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this 5-day-old boy, including poor feeding, irritability, and noisy breathing, along with physical examination findings of sunken fontanelles, tightly clenched fists, and erythema around the umbilical cord stump, is consistent with neonatal tetanus. Neonatal tetanus is caused by the bacterium Clostridium tetani, which produces a neurotoxin called tetanospasmin. 

Tetanospasmin acts by inhibiting the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as glycine, from inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord. This leads to unopposed muscle contraction and the characteristic symptoms of tetanus, including muscle stiffness, spasms, and rigidity. The tightly clenched fists and irritability seen in this patient are consistent with muscle stiffness and spasms caused by the decreased release of glycine.

The other options are not consistent with the pathogenesis of neonatal tetanus. Decreased release of acetylcholine (option A) is not the primary mechanism involved in tetanus. Inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels (option B) is seen in local anesthetic toxicity, not tetanus. Destruction of Schwann cells (option C) is seen in conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, not tetanus. Destruction of anterior horn cells (option E) is seen in conditions such as poliomyelitis, not tetanus.",
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of progressive pain and stiffness of the fingers of her right hand. The stiffness is worse at the end of the day. She recently retired after working for 28 years as a typist at a data entry firm. Physical examination shows swelling, joint-line tenderness, and decreased range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and the distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. Discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules are palpated over the 2nd and 4th distal interphalangeal joints of the right hand. An x-ray of her right hand shows narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces with subchondral sclerosis and osteophytes. Which of the following is the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Monosodium urate crystal precipitation in the joints
(B): Bacterial infection of the joint space
(C): Autoimmune-mediated cartilage erosion
(D): Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal precipitation in the joints
(E): Degenerative disease of the joints
",Degenerative disease of the joints,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Degenerative disease of the joints.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, as well as the x-ray findings, the most likely underlying mechanism of this patient's condition is degenerative disease of the joints. The patient's symptoms of pain and stiffness, worse at the end of the day, along with the presence of joint-line tenderness and decreased range of motion, are consistent with osteoarthritis. The discrete, hard, mildly tender nodules palpated over the distal interphalangeal joints are known as Heberden's nodes, which are a characteristic finding in osteoarthritis. The x-ray findings of narrowing of the interphalangeal joint spaces, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophytes further support the diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joints, leading to pain, stiffness, and loss of function. It is commonly seen in older individuals and can be associated with repetitive use or joint stress, such as in this patient who worked as a typist for many years.",
"An 81-year-old man patient recently moved into an assisted living facility and presents today with itchy blisters in his axilla. He attributes these to a poor diet. He also complains that the nurse practitioner at the facility started him on 4 new medications, in addition to his existing prescriptions. On physical examination, tense axillary bullae are noted that do not rupture with light, gloved touch. On direct immunofluorescence, linear C3 and IgG deposits are seen along the basement membrane. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
(B): Toxic epidermal necrolysis
(C): Bullous pemphigoid
(D): Pemphigus vulgaris
(E): Cicatricial pemphigoid
",Bullous pemphigoid,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Bullous pemphigoid.

Explanation:
Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects elderly individuals. It is characterized by tense bullae that do not rupture easily and are often accompanied by intense itching. The presence of linear C3 and IgG deposits along the basement membrane on direct immunofluorescence is a characteristic finding in bullous pemphigoid.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (option A) is a bacterial infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and is characterized by widespread blistering and skin peeling. It is unlikely in this case as the patient's symptoms are localized to the axilla and there is no mention of widespread involvement.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (option B) is a severe and potentially life-threatening drug reaction characterized by widespread blistering and skin detachment. It is unlikely in this case as the patient's symptoms are localized to the axilla and there is no mention of widespread involvement.

Pemphigus vulgaris (option D) is another autoimmune blistering disorder, but it is characterized by flaccid bullae that easily rupture and form erosions. The presence of tense bullae that do not rupture easily in this patient makes pemphigus vulgaris less likely.

Cicatricial pemphigoid (option E) is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that primarily affects mucous membranes, such as the oral cavity and conjunctiva. It is unlikely in this case as the patient's symptoms are localized to the axilla and there is no mention of involvement of mucous membranes.",
"A previously healthy 18-year-old army recruit is brought to a military treatment facility because of a 3-week history of right foot pain. He recently started basic infantry training and has been running several kilometers daily. Initially, the pain only occurred while running, but now it is also present at rest. The pain is located diffusely over the right forefoot. Vital signs are within normal range. Examination shows mild swelling over the distal right forefoot. Pressing the metatarsal of the third right toe results in pain. He walks with an antalgic gait. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An x-ray of the right foot shows a slight loss of cortical density and callus formation at the third metatarsal shaft. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Rest and acetaminophen
(B): Ultrasonography
(C): Technetium bone scan
(D): CT scan
(E): Internal fixation
",Rest and acetaminophen,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Rest and acetaminophen.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a stress fracture of the third metatarsal. Stress fractures are common in individuals who engage in repetitive activities, such as running, especially when there is a sudden increase in intensity or duration of the activity. The diffuse pain over the right forefoot, tenderness on palpation of the third metatarsal, and callus formation on x-ray are consistent with a stress fracture.

The initial management of a stress fracture involves rest and pain control. Rest allows for the healing of the fracture and reduces the risk of further injury. Acetaminophen can be used for pain control in this case. Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also be considered, but caution should be exercised in military recruits due to the potential for adverse effects on renal function and hydration status.

Ultrasonography, technetium bone scan, CT scan, and internal fixation are not indicated as the initial management for a stress fracture. Ultrasonography may be used to evaluate soft tissue injuries, but it is not necessary in this case. Technetium bone scan and CT scan may be used to confirm the diagnosis of a stress fracture, but they are not necessary in this case since the clinical presentation and x-ray findings are consistent with a stress fracture. Internal fixation is not indicated as the initial management for a stress fracture, as it is typically reserved for cases of nonunion or delayed union.",
"Thirty minutes after delivery, a 3600-g (7-lb 15-oz) newborn has noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of her lips, and intermittent respiratory distress. She was born at 38 weeks' gestation and required bag-mask resuscitation immediately after delivery. Pregnancy was uncomplicated. Her mother has noticed the bluish lip discoloration worsen when she fed and improve when she cried. The patient's pulse is 163/min, respirations are 62/min, and blood pressure is 60/30 mm Hg. The crying infant's lungs are clear to auscultation. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray
(B): Boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray
(C): Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible
(D): Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible
(E): Scaphoid abdomen
",Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity not possible.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this newborn, including noisy breathing, bluish discoloration of the lips, and intermittent respiratory distress, is concerning for a congenital heart defect. The worsening of bluish lip discoloration during feeding and improvement during crying suggests that the baby is experiencing increased pulmonary blood flow during feeding, leading to increased cyanosis. This is known as ""feeding-induced cyanosis"" and is a characteristic finding in infants with congenital heart defects.

The physical examination findings of a rapid pulse (163/min), increased respiratory rate (62/min), and low blood pressure (60/30 mm Hg) further support the suspicion of a congenital heart defect. These findings indicate that the baby is experiencing increased cardiac output and decreased systemic vascular resistance, which are compensatory mechanisms in response to the heart defect.

Given these clinical findings, further evaluation is most likely to show that the passage of a catheter through the nasal cavity is not possible. This is because infants with congenital heart defects often have obstructed nasal passages due to the presence of a large thymus or other anatomical abnormalities. The inability to pass a catheter through the nasal cavity is a common finding in these cases.

The other options are less likely to be seen in this patient. Diffuse reticulogranular densities on chest x-ray (option A) are typically seen in respiratory distress syndrome, which is unlikely in this term infant. A boot-shaped heart on chest x-ray (option B) is characteristic of tetralogy of Fallot, which typically presents with cyanosis in the first few days of life, not immediately after delivery. Passage of a gastric catheter through the mouth not possible (option C) is not a typical finding in infants with congenital heart defects. A scaphoid abdomen (option E) is not suggestive of any specific diagnosis in this context.",
"A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department by her mother 30 minutes after the sudden onset of shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria. The symptoms began 5 minutes after she ate a peanut butter sandwich. Her respirations are 36/min and blood pressure is 84/50 mm Hg. There is stridor on auscultation of the chest. She is intubated and mechanical ventilation is begun. Intravenous fluid resuscitation and the appropriate pharmacotherapy are begun. The drug administered to this patient most likely has which of the following effects on cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential?
Options:
(A): Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4
(B): Increased Na+ influx in phase 3
(C): Decreased Ca2+ influx in phase 0
(D): Increased K+ efflux in phase 4
(E): Decreased K+ efflux during phase 3
""
",Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4.

Explanation:
The symptoms described in the scenario, including shortness of breath, dizziness, abdominal pain, and urticaria, are consistent with an allergic reaction, specifically anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause cardiovascular collapse.

During an action potential in cardiac pacemaker cells, phase 4 is the resting membrane potential. In this phase, there is a slow depolarization due to the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+). This influx of calcium ions is responsible for the spontaneous depolarization and initiation of the action potential in pacemaker cells.

In the case of anaphylaxis, the drug administered to the patient is likely epinephrine (adrenaline). Epinephrine acts on cardiac pacemaker cells by increasing the influx of calcium ions (Ca2+) during phase 4. This leads to an increased rate of depolarization and an increased heart rate, which helps to counteract the cardiovascular collapse seen in anaphylaxis.

Therefore, the drug administered to this patient most likely has the effect of increased Ca2+ influx in phase 4 of the cardiac pacemaker cells during an action potential.",
"A 3-day-old boy is admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for seizures. He was born to a 33-year-old woman at 31 weeks gestation via cesarean section. His birth weight was 1400 grams. Vital signs are significant for systemic hypotension, bradycardia, and hypoventilation. On physical exam, the patient has an altered level of consciousness with decreased spontaneous and elicited movements. The patient is hypotonic on motor testing, has bulging anterior fontanelle, and appears cyanotic. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Complete blood count
(B): Cranial ultrasonography
(C): Electroencephalography
(D): Head CT
(E): MRI of the head
",Cranial ultrasonography,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Cranial ultrasonography.

Explanation:
Given the clinical presentation of a 3-day-old boy with seizures, altered level of consciousness, hypotonia, bulging anterior fontanelle, and cyanosis, the most likely cause of these symptoms is increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to a possible intracranial hemorrhage or other structural abnormalities. Cranial ultrasonography is the best next step in management to evaluate for these conditions.

Cranial ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging modality that can be performed at the bedside in the neonatal intensive care unit. It is the initial imaging study of choice in neonates with suspected intracranial pathology. It can provide valuable information about the presence and location of intracranial hemorrhage, ventricular size, and other structural abnormalities.

Complete blood count (option A) may be helpful in evaluating for anemia or infection, but it is not the best next step in this case as it does not directly evaluate for the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Electroencephalography (option C) may be useful in evaluating for seizure activity and determining the type of seizures, but it does not provide information about the underlying cause of the seizures or the presence of intracranial pathology.

Head CT (option D) and MRI of the head (option E) are both imaging modalities that can provide detailed information about intracranial pathology. However, in a neonate with unstable vital signs and suspected increased ICP, cranial ultrasonography is preferred as it can be performed at the bedside without the need for transport to the radiology department, which may be risky for the patient.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is cranial ultrasonography (option B).",
"A 39-year-old man seeks an evaluation in the emergency room due to an episode of syncope at work. He says that he has felt increasing shortness of breath while exercising over the past 6 months. He is a well-built man in mild distress. The vital signs include heart rate 98/min, respiratory rate 18/min, temperature 36.5°C (97.7°F), and blood pressure 135/90 mm Hg. The cardiac examination is significant for a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border which is accentuated by forceful expiration against a closed airway. Palpation of the carotid artery shows 2 closely spaced pulses which occur during systole. Which of the following is most consistent with these findings?
Options:
(A): Aortic dissection
(B): Aortic stenosis
(C): Cardiac tamponade
(D): Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
(E): Third-degree heart block
",Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of syncope and increasing shortness of breath with exercise, along with the physical examination findings of a harsh systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal border and palpable carotid artery pulses during systole, are most consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

HCM is a genetic disorder characterized by hypertrophy (thickening) of the myocardium, most commonly involving the interventricular septum. This hypertrophy can obstruct the left ventricular outflow tract, leading to symptoms such as syncope and exertional dyspnea. The harsh systolic ejection murmur heard at the left lower sternal border is caused by turbulent blood flow through the narrowed outflow tract. The palpable carotid artery pulses during systole, known as pulsus bisferiens, are a characteristic finding in HCM and result from the combination of the ejection of blood through the narrowed outflow tract and the regurgitation of blood back into the left ventricle during systole.

Aortic dissection (A) typically presents with severe tearing or ripping chest pain that radiates to the back. It is not associated with the findings described in this patient.

Aortic stenosis (B) typically presents with exertional dyspnea, angina, and syncope. The murmur of aortic stenosis is typically heard best at the right upper sternal border and radiates to the carotid arteries. The findings in this patient are not consistent with aortic stenosis.

Cardiac tamponade (C) typically presents with Beck triad (hypotension, muffled heart sounds, and jugular venous distention) and pulsus paradoxus. The findings in this patient are not consistent with cardiac tamponade.

Third-degree heart block (E) typically presents with bradycardia, dizziness, and syncope. The findings in this patient are not consistent with third-degree heart block.",
"A 26-year-old nullipara presents to her physician for a routine check-up at 18 weeks gestation. She has no co-morbidities. Her only complaints are fatigability and a depressed mood for the past 2 weeks. Her vital signs are as follows: blood pressure, 125/80 mm Hg; heart rate, 87/min; respiratory rate, 14/min; and temperature, 36.7℃ (98℉). The physical examination is unremarkable and the gynecologic examination is consistent with 18 weeks gestation. A thyroid profile s ordered to check for a possible cause of the fatigability and decreased mood:
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 0.3 mU/L
Total T4 160 nmol/L
Free T4 13 pmol/L
Corresponding to the obtained results, how should the patient be managed?
Options:
(A): Prescribe levothyroxine 50 mcg daily
(B): No specific management required
(C): Recommend additional anti-TPO test
(D): Prescribe methimazole 10 mg daily
(E): Recommend additional T3 assessment
",No specific management required,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) No specific management required.

Explanation:
The patient's TSH level is low (0.3 mU/L), which indicates hyperthyroidism. However, her total T4 and free T4 levels are within the normal range. In pregnancy, it is common for TSH levels to decrease due to the increase in estrogen levels, which can suppress TSH secretion. This is known as gestational transient thyrotoxicosis and does not require specific management.

Additionally, the patient's symptoms of fatigability and depressed mood can be attributed to the normal physiological changes and hormonal fluctuations that occur during pregnancy. Therefore, no specific treatment is necessary in this case.

Prescribing levothyroxine (option A) is not indicated as the patient's thyroid hormone levels are within the normal range. Recommending additional anti-TPO test (option C) is not necessary as the patient's symptoms and thyroid hormone levels do not suggest autoimmune thyroid disease. Prescribing methimazole (option D) is not appropriate as the patient does not have hyperthyroidism. Recommending additional T3 assessment (option E) is not needed as the patient's T4 levels are within the normal range.",
"A 42-year-old man presents to your office complaining of right-sided facial swelling that has progressively worsened over the last month after returning from a trip to India. On examination, the patient has an obvious distortion of the facial features on the right without erythema or lymphadenopathy. A neurological exam reveals no deficits. His blood pressure is 115/80 mm Hg, heart rate is 65/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F). The patient states that he has been having trouble chewing his food, but is not experiencing any pain. The patient is up to date on all of his immunizations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his facial swelling?
Options:
(A): Benign cystic tumor with stroma resembling lymph node tissue
(B): Benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue
(C): An infection with paramyxovirus
(D): Malignant tumor composed of squamous and mucinous cells
(E): Sialolithiasis that has progressed to a S. aureus infection
",Benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Benign salivary gland tumor composed of stromal and epithelial tissue.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's symptoms of right-sided facial swelling, distortion of facial features, and difficulty chewing without pain suggest a salivary gland tumor. The absence of erythema or lymphadenopathy, normal blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature, and the fact that the patient is up to date on immunizations make other causes less likely.

Option (A) Benign cystic tumor with stroma resembling lymph node tissue is less likely because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a salivary gland tumor rather than a cystic tumor.

Option (C) An infection with paramyxovirus, such as mumps, would typically present with bilateral parotid swelling and symptoms of fever, malaise, and pain. The patient's symptoms are more suggestive of a tumor rather than an infection.

Option (D) Malignant tumor composed of squamous and mucinous cells is less likely because the patient's symptoms have been progressively worsening over a month without any signs of systemic illness or metastasis.

Option (E) Sialolithiasis that has progressed to a S. aureus infection is less likely because the patient does not have any signs of infection, such as fever or erythema, and the symptoms are more consistent with a tumor rather than an infection.",
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother. His mother reports multiple instances over the past month when she walked into his room while he was masturbating. She is worried he may be going through some sort of “problem.” He is currently in 9th grade; his mother says that he is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does reasonably well in school. On examination, he seems embarrassed and avoids making eye contact. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Advise the patient to stop masturbating
(B): Measure serum testosterone level
(C): Refer the patient for behavioral therapy
(D): Reassure the mother
(E): Prescribe sertraline
",Reassure the mother,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Reassure the mother.

Explanation:
Masturbation is a normal and healthy sexual behavior, especially during adolescence. It is important to reassure the mother that her son's behavior is within the normal range of sexual development. Masturbation is a common and natural way for individuals to explore their own bodies and learn about their own sexual feelings. It does not indicate any underlying problem or pathology.

The fact that the patient is the captain of his high school wrestling team and does well in school suggests that he is functioning well in other areas of his life. The embarrassment and avoidance of eye contact during the examination are also common reactions in adolescents when discussing sexual matters.

There is no indication to measure serum testosterone levels in this case. Testosterone levels are not routinely measured in the evaluation of masturbation.

Referring the patient for behavioral therapy or prescribing sertraline are not appropriate in this case. Masturbation is a normal behavior and does not require any intervention or treatment.

Referring the patient for psychoanalytic therapy is also not necessary. Masturbation is a normal part of sexual development and does not require psychoanalytic therapy.",
"A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic with easy fatigability and breathlessness when climbing stairs for the last 2 weeks. He also mentions that he occasionally has bouts of cough at night after about 2–3 hours of sleep which is relieved when he sits upright. He denies shortness of breath at rest, palpitations, and loss of consciousness. He has had hypertension for the last 20 years and is on antihypertensive medications. On physical examination, his temperature is 36.9°C (98.4°F), pulse is 104/min, blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg, and respirations are 18/min. Chest auscultation reveals crackles over the lung bases bilaterally. Examination of his abdomen reveals mildly tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigation results include a hemoglobin of 14.8 g/dL (9.18 mmol/L) and an elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide. His two-dimensional echocardiogram reveals an enlarged left atrium and an ejection fraction of 55%. Which of the following novel drugs is most likely to benefit the patient in addition to valsartan?
Options:
(A): Etanercept
(B): Ivabradine
(C): Moxonidine
(D): Sacubitril
(E): Aliskiren
",Sacubitril,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Sacubitril.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the laboratory and echocardiogram results, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). HFpEF is characterized by symptoms of heart failure, such as easy fatigability and breathlessness, with a preserved ejection fraction on echocardiogram.

Sacubitril is a novel drug that is part of a combination medication called sacubitril/valsartan. It is indicated for the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but recent studies have shown potential benefits in patients with HFpEF as well. Sacubitril is a neprilysin inhibitor, which increases the levels of natriuretic peptides, such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), in the body. Natriuretic peptides have vasodilatory and diuretic effects, which can help improve symptoms and outcomes in heart failure patients.

In this patient, the elevated BNP level suggests increased cardiac stress and dysfunction. Adding sacubitril to his current treatment with valsartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, can further enhance the beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling, reduce symptoms, and improve outcomes in HFpEF.

Therefore, sacubitril is the most likely drug to benefit this patient in addition to valsartan.",
"A 69-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for trouble sleeping. The patient states that he recently retired from working the day shift at a cemetery. When the patient retired, his goal was to finally be able to go out with his wife; however, he finds that he is unable to stay awake past 6 pm in the evening. His inability to stay awake has been straining his marriage as his wife is disappointed that they cannot do any activities in the evening together. The patient has tried drinking caffeine but finds that it does not help. The patient’s wife claims that the patient seems to sleep peacefully, and the patient states he feels rested when he awakes. The patient has a past medical history of irritable bowel syndrome which is managed with fiber supplements. The patient’s neurological exam is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Obstructive sleep apnea
(B): Delayed sleep phase disorder
(C): Advanced sleep phase disorder
(D): Chronic insomnia
(E): Normal aging
",Advanced sleep phase disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Advanced sleep phase disorder.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing difficulty staying awake past 6 pm in the evening, which is consistent with an advanced sleep phase disorder. This disorder is characterized by a shift in the timing of the sleep-wake cycle, causing individuals to fall asleep and wake up earlier than desired. In this case, the patient's inability to stay awake in the evening is interfering with his ability to engage in activities with his wife.

The patient's history of working the day shift at a cemetery may have contributed to the development of this disorder, as exposure to bright light in the morning can shift the sleep-wake cycle earlier. Additionally, the patient's use of caffeine to stay awake in the evening suggests that he is trying to override his natural sleep-wake pattern.

The patient's wife's observation that the patient sleeps peacefully and the patient's report of feeling rested when he wakes up are consistent with the diagnosis of advanced sleep phase disorder. In contrast, conditions such as obstructive sleep apnea, delayed sleep phase disorder, and chronic insomnia would typically present with different symptoms and characteristics.

It is important to note that normal aging can also affect sleep patterns, but in this case, the patient's symptoms are not solely attributed to normal aging. Therefore, advanced sleep phase disorder is the most likely diagnosis.",
"A 62-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She feels well. Six months ago, she was vaccinated against influenza. Her last mammography 1 year ago showed no abnormalities. Two years ago, a pap smear and colonoscopy were normal. She has a history of hypertension. Her father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 50 years. She emigrated from Japan 30 years ago. She has smoked one-half pack of cigarettes daily for the last 18 years. She drinks 4–5 glasses of wine per day. She goes ballroom dancing twice each week. Her medications include enalapril and low-dose aspirin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 50 kg (110 lb); BMI is 18 kg/m2. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows a soft S4 gallop. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Pap smear
(B): Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry
(C): Abdominal ultrasonography
(D): Low-dose chest CT
(E): Transesophageal echocardiography
",Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Dual-energy x-ray bone absorptiometry.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's age, gender, and risk factors, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess her bone mineral density (BMD). This patient is a postmenopausal woman with multiple risk factors for osteoporosis, including her age, history of smoking, and low body weight (BMI of 18 kg/m2). DXA is the gold standard for diagnosing osteoporosis and assessing fracture risk. It measures BMD at the hip and spine, which are the most common sites for osteoporotic fractures. The results of DXA can help guide treatment decisions, such as the initiation of pharmacotherapy to prevent fractures. 

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient:
(A) Pap smear: The patient had a normal pap smear two years ago, and routine pap smears are typically recommended every three years for women aged 21-65 years. Therefore, a pap smear is not indicated at this time.
(C) Abdominal ultrasonography: There is no indication for abdominal ultrasonography based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.
(D) Low-dose chest CT: There is no indication for a low-dose chest CT based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.
(E) Transesophageal echocardiography: There is no indication for transesophageal echocardiography based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.",
"A 25-year-old female with Hodgkin's lymphoma presents with a several day history of edema. Lab studies show:

Serum Na+: 140 mmol/L
Serum K+: 3.5 mmol/L
Serum albumin: 1.9 g/dL
Total serum bilirubin: 1.0 mg/dL
Serum creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL

Urinalysis shows 4+ proteinuria and fatty casts. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(B): Membranous nephropathy
(C): Minimal change disease
(D): Amyloidosis
(E): Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis
",Minimal change disease,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Minimal change disease.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of edema, proteinuria, and fatty casts in the urine is consistent with nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by the presence of significant proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. 

In this case, the low serum albumin level (1.9 g/dL) indicates hypoalbuminemia, which is a hallmark of nephrotic syndrome. The presence of 4+ proteinuria on urinalysis further supports this diagnosis.

Minimal change disease is the most likely cause of nephrotic syndrome in a young adult with Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children and accounts for a significant proportion of cases in adults as well. The name ""minimal change disease"" refers to the fact that the glomeruli appear normal under light microscopy, and the characteristic changes are only seen on electron microscopy.

Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is another cause of nephrotic syndrome, but it is less likely in this case because FSGS is more commonly associated with African American race, obesity, and HIV infection. Membranous nephropathy is characterized by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and is less likely in this case. Amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the glomeruli and is less likely in a young adult with Hodgkin's lymphoma. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is characterized by proliferation of mesangial cells and is less likely in this case.",
"A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of mild left-sided abdominal pain when lifting heavy objects that has developed over the past 6 months. He has had a weight loss of 41 kgs (90 lbs) in the past year. Physical examination shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left. A CT scan of the abdomen of a patient with the same condition is shown. Which of the following muscles is located directly medial to the pathology seen on the CT scan?
Options:
(A): Psoas major
(B): Internal oblique
(C): External oblique
(D): Rectus abdominis
(E): Transverse abdominal
""
",Rectus abdominis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Rectus abdominis.

Explanation:
The CT scan shows a soft bulge inferior and lateral to the navel on the left side. The muscle that is located directly medial to this pathology is the rectus abdominis. The rectus abdominis is a paired muscle that runs vertically along the midline of the abdomen, from the pubic symphysis to the xiphoid process. It is located in the anterior abdominal wall and is responsible for flexing the trunk and compressing the abdominal contents. In this case, the bulge seen on the CT scan is likely a hernia, and the rectus abdominis muscle is located medial to the hernia.",
"A 7-year-old woman presents shortly after her birthday with red scaly plaques over both ears. Her mother reports that the patient recently received a pair of fashionable silver earrings from her older sister as a birthday present. Physical examination is only significant for erythema and tenderness over the lobules of the ears bilaterally. Her vital signs show a blood pressure of 121/73 mm Hg, heart rate of 72/min, and a respiratory rate of 21/min. Her medical history is non-significant. Of the following options, which is the mechanism of this reaction?
Options:
(A): Type I–anaphylactic hypersensitivity reaction
(B): Type II–cytotoxic hypersensitivity reaction
(C): Type III–immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction
(D): Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction
(E): Type III and IV–mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions
",Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): Type IV–cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with red scaly plaques over both ears, along with a history of recently receiving silver earrings, suggests a contact dermatitis reaction. Contact dermatitis is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, which is a cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction.

In contact dermatitis, exposure to an allergen (in this case, the silver earrings) leads to activation of T cells, which then release cytokines and recruit inflammatory cells to the site of exposure. This results in the characteristic erythema, scaling, and tenderness seen in the patient's ears.

Type I hypersensitivity reactions (option A) are immediate hypersensitivity reactions mediated by IgE antibodies. They typically present with symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, and respiratory symptoms, which are not seen in this patient.

Type II hypersensitivity reactions (option B) involve the destruction of target cells by antibodies, such as in autoimmune hemolytic anemia or drug-induced hemolytic anemia. This mechanism is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Type III hypersensitivity reactions (option C) involve the formation of immune complexes that deposit in tissues and activate complement. This mechanism is seen in conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus or serum sickness, but it is not the mechanism involved in contact dermatitis.

Option E suggests a mixed immune complex and cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction, but there is no evidence to support the involvement of immune complexes in this patient's presentation.

Therefore, the most appropriate mechanism for this patient's reaction is a type IV cell-mediated (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction, which is consistent with contact dermatitis.",
"A 34-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea. He has bowel movements 10–12 times daily; the stool contains blood and mucus. He constantly has the urge to defecate. His vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the abdomen shows diffuse tenderness to palpation. Serum concentration of C-reactive protein is 20 mg/L (N<10). Colonoscopy shows a bleeding, ulcerated rectal mucosa with several pseudopolyps. Which of the following is this patient at greatest risk of developing?
Options:
(A): Hemolytic uremic syndrome
(B): Oral ulcers
(C): Colorectal cancer
(D): Gastric cancer
(E): Pancreatic cancer
",Colorectal cancer,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Colorectal cancer.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings on colonoscopy, the most likely diagnosis is inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), specifically ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that primarily affects the colon and rectum. It is characterized by symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea (often with blood and mucus), and a constant urge to defecate.

Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. The risk of colorectal cancer increases with the duration and extent of the disease. Pseudopolyps, which are seen on colonoscopy in this patient, are a characteristic finding in ulcerative colitis and are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

Hemolytic uremic syndrome (A) is a condition characterized by the triad of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury. It is most commonly caused by infection with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) or by certain types of medications. This patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Oral ulcers (B) are not typically associated with ulcerative colitis. They are more commonly seen in other conditions such as Behçet's disease or recurrent aphthous stomatitis.

Gastric cancer (D) and pancreatic cancer (E) are not typically associated with ulcerative colitis. The primary gastrointestinal malignancy associated with ulcerative colitis is colorectal cancer.

Therefore, the patient in this case is at greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer. Regular surveillance colonoscopies are recommended in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis to detect and manage any precancerous or cancerous changes in the colon.",
"A 32-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with complaints of a headache. The last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She also reports having a mild headache for 1 month. There has been a grape-like mass protruding from her vagina for the last 15 days. On examination, the fundus of the uterus is at the level of the umbilicus and no fetal heart sounds are heard. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg, pulse rate 108/min. On USG examination, no fetal parts are seen. What will be the genotype of the substance which will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation?
Options:
(A): 69XXY
(B): 45XO
(C): 23XX
(D): 47XYY
(E): 46XX
",46XX,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) 46XX.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is most likely experiencing a molar pregnancy, specifically a complete hydatidiform mole. A complete hydatidiform mole is characterized by the absence of fetal parts on ultrasound examination, the presence of a grape-like mass protruding from the vagina, and an elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. 

In a complete hydatidiform mole, there is an abnormal fertilization of an empty egg by a single sperm, resulting in a diploid (46 chromosomes) genotype. The genotype of the substance that will be aspirated by dilation and evacuation in this case will be 46XX, as the patient is a female and has two X chromosomes.",
"A 42-year-old woman comes to the clinic for a routine annual exam. She recently moved from New Jersey, and her medical records show a total colectomy. The patient reports that she has had annual colonoscopies since she was 10 years of age because her father had “a condition with his colon.” What is the genetic inheritance pattern of the patient’s disease?
Options:
(A): Autosomal dominant
(B): Autosomal recessive
(C): Multifactorial
(D): X-linked dominant
(E): X-linked recessive
",Autosomal dominant,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Autosomal dominant.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient's father had a condition with his colon, and the patient has had annual colonoscopies since she was 10 years old. Additionally, her medical records show a total colectomy. These findings suggest that the patient's disease is likely a hereditary condition. 

The most common hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome is familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), which is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. FAP is characterized by the development of thousands of adenomatous polyps throughout the large bowel. The presence of a total colectomy in the patient's medical records further supports the diagnosis of FAP.

Therefore, the genetic inheritance pattern of the patient's disease is autosomal dominant.",
"A 2-day-old infant male is brought to the emergency department with a 5-hour history of vomiting and irritability. He was born at home and had unreliable prenatal care because his parents have been experiencing housing instability. About a day after birth, he started to become lethargic and was feeding poorly. His parents thought that he might just be tired so they put him to bed; however, by the next morning he started to vomit and act extremely irritable. On presentation, he is found to have nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles. Based on this presentation, appropriate cultures are obtained and he is placed on empiric antibiotics. After all cultures grow out the same gram-positive bacteria, the patient is narrowed to penicillin G. Which of the following is a characteristic of the most likely organism that is causing this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Creates a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar
(B): Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus
(C): Produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide
(D): Produces toxin that increases cAMP levels
(E): Tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees
",Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Enlarges hemolytic area of Staphylococcus aureus.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of nuchal rigidity, bulging fontanelles, vomiting, and irritability, along with the fact that the cultures grew out gram-positive bacteria, the most likely organism causing these symptoms is Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of neonatal meningitis and can lead to symptoms such as nuchal rigidity and bulging fontanelles.

The characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus that is mentioned in option (B) is that it enlarges the hemolytic area on blood agar. Staphylococcus aureus produces hemolysins, which are toxins that can cause the destruction of red blood cells and create a clear zone of hemolysis around the bacterial colonies on blood agar. This characteristic is useful in identifying Staphylococcus aureus in the laboratory.

Options (A), (C), (D), and (E) are not characteristic of Staphylococcus aureus. Option (A) refers to Streptococcus pneumoniae, which creates a green zone of hemolysis on blood agar. Option (C) refers to Neisseria meningitidis, which produces lipooligosaccharide rather than lipopolysaccharide. Option (D) refers to Bordetella pertussis, which produces a toxin that increases cAMP levels. Option (E) refers to Listeria monocytogenes, which exhibits tumbling motility in broth at 22 degrees Celsius.",
"A 58-year-old man with hypertension and dyslipidemia comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He says he feels well. He is 180 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 103 kg (227 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. His BMI last year was 27 kg/m2. When asked about his diet, he says, “Being overweight runs in my family. Rather than fight it, I just try to enjoy myself and eat what I want.” Which of the following defense mechanisms best describes the patient's response to the physician?
Options:
(A): Rationalization
(B): Primitive idealization
(C): Fantasy
(D): Distortion
(E): Intellectualization
",Rationalization,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Rationalization.

Explanation:
Rationalization is a defense mechanism in which a person justifies or explains their behavior or feelings in a way that makes them seem more acceptable or logical. In this case, the patient is rationalizing his unhealthy eating habits by attributing them to his family history of being overweight. He is essentially saying that because being overweight runs in his family, he is justified in eating what he wants and not trying to fight against it. This defense mechanism allows him to avoid taking responsibility for his own choices and behaviors.",
"A 27-year-old college student presents to his physician for constant fatigue. The patient states that for the past several weeks he has felt oddly fatigued and has struggled to complete his work. He is a foreign exchange student and is concerned he will fail out of his academic program. He has experienced some occasional nausea and vomiting which has caused him to lose weight. The patient is a first year college student, drinks alcohol regularly, smokes marijuana, and has unprotected sex with multiple partners. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 127/68 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Laboratory values are ordered as seen below.

Serum:
Na+: 139 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 4.3 mEq/L
HCO3-: 25 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 99 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.2 mg/dL
Total bilirubin: 2.0 mg/dL
AST: 85 U/L
ALT: 92 U/L

Urine
Color: Amber/brown
Marijuana: Positive
Amphetamines: Positive
Cocaine: Positive

The patient refuses an examination of his genitals. Which of the following is the best diagnostic test?
Options:
(A): CAGE questions
(B): Direct influenza antigen
(C): Uretheral swab and culture
(D): Viral core antibody
(E): Viral surface antibody
",Viral core antibody,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Viral core antibody.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and occasional nausea and vomiting, as well as the laboratory values and urine drug screen results, the most likely diagnosis is hepatitis. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) suggest liver inflammation, and the positive urine drug screen for marijuana, amphetamines, and cocaine suggests possible drug-induced hepatitis.

The best diagnostic test in this scenario would be to test for viral hepatitis, specifically hepatitis B and C. The viral core antibody test is used to detect antibodies against the core protein of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). This test can help determine if the patient has been exposed to HBV in the past, which would be consistent with the patient's risk factors (unprotected sex with multiple partners, drug use). 

It is important to note that the patient's refusal for a genital examination does not rule out the possibility of hepatitis, as hepatitis can be transmitted through other routes such as intravenous drug use or contaminated needles. Therefore, testing for viral hepatitis is still warranted in this case.",
"A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and shortness of breath on exertion in addition to a 1-month history of ankle swelling. She has a history of sleep apnea. Examination of the lower extremities shows bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema. Cardiac examination shows a widely split S2 that varies with respiration. An ECG shows right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema?
Options:
(A): Localized lymphatic obstruction
(B): Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans
(C): Thrombus formation in a deep vein
(D): Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure
(E): Decreased plasma oncotic pressure
""
",Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Increased capillary hydrostatic pressure.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, and ankle swelling, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral pitting pedal and ankle edema, suggest the presence of fluid accumulation in the lower extremities. The widely split S2 on cardiac examination and the right bundle branch block on ECG are consistent with right heart dysfunction. 

In this case, the most likely etiology of the patient's lower extremity edema is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure. Right heart dysfunction, such as right ventricular failure, can lead to increased pressure in the pulmonary circulation, which in turn can cause increased capillary hydrostatic pressure in the systemic circulation. This increased pressure can result in fluid leakage from the capillaries into the interstitial space, leading to edema.

Localized lymphatic obstruction (option A) would typically result in unilateral edema, not bilateral edema as seen in this patient.

Dermal accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (option B) is seen in conditions such as mucopolysaccharidoses, which are rare genetic disorders. This is not a likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Thrombus formation in a deep vein (option C) would typically result in unilateral edema and would be associated with pain and warmth in the affected limb. The absence of these findings makes deep vein thrombosis less likely in this patient.

Decreased plasma oncotic pressure (option E) can result from conditions such as hypoalbuminemia, but this would typically lead to generalized edema rather than isolated lower extremity edema. Additionally, the patient's history and physical examination findings are more consistent with increased capillary hydrostatic pressure as the cause of her edema.",
"A 62-year-old man presents with bright red blood in his stool which occurred 2 times this week. He denies fever, weight loss, pain, pruritus or urinary symptoms. Past medical history is significant for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and recent appendicitis, status post laparoscopic appendectomy complicated by delirium tremens. His vitals are a temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg, pulse of 78/min, and respiratory rate of 12/min. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with shifting dullness on percussion. In addition, multiple purple spider web-like lesions are present on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied. Fecal occult blood test is negative. On anoscopy, a non-tender, dilated vascular protrusion is noted superior to the pectinate line. Which of the following is most likely true about this patient’s current symptoms?
Options:
(A): This patient has peptic ulcer disease.
(B): The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.
(C): The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior vena cava.
(D): The vascular protrusion drains into the inferior rectal vein.
(E): Fecal leukocytes and a stool culture are required for diagnosis.
",The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) The vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with internal hemorrhoids, which are dilated vascular protrusions located superior to the pectinate line. Internal hemorrhoids are painless and can cause bright red blood in the stool. The presence of multiple purple spider web-like lesions on the chest and arms, which blanch when pressure is applied, suggests the presence of spider angiomas. Spider angiomas are commonly seen in patients with liver disease, such as cirrhosis, and are caused by increased estrogen levels and decreased estrogen metabolism. In liver disease, blood bypasses the liver through collateral vessels, leading to increased pressure in the superior rectal vein. This increased pressure can cause dilated vascular protrusions, or internal hemorrhoids, which drain into the superior rectal vein. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is that the vascular protrusion drains into the superior rectal vein.",
"A 55-year-old woman presents to the office because she has been feeling weak. For the past 2 years, she has been urinating a considerable volume every time she goes to the bathroom. She has no past medical history. Her heart rate is 86/min, respiratory rate is 15/min, temperature is 37.4°C (99.3°F), and blood pressure is 111/79 mm Hg. Laboratory studies are significant for the following:
Calcium 13.8 mg/dL
PTH 230 pg/mL
Her complete metabolic panel is otherwise within normal limits. Imaging studies show subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. Scintigraphy reveals the most common pathologic condition associated with the patient’s diagnosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Adenoma
(B): Carcinoma
(C): Decreased calcitriol concentration
(D): Glandular hyperplasia
(E): Phosphate retention
",Adenoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Adenoma.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of weakness, polyuria, and laboratory findings of hypercalcemia (calcium 13.8 mg/dL) and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH 230 pg/mL) are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma, which accounts for approximately 80-85% of cases. Adenomas are benign tumors that arise from the parathyroid glands and secrete excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, leading to increased calcium levels in the blood. The elevated calcium levels can result in various symptoms, including weakness and osteoporosis. The imaging studies showing subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis further support the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. Carcinoma (B) is a less common cause of primary hyperparathyroidism and is associated with more aggressive disease. Decreased calcitriol concentration (C) is not a typical finding in primary hyperparathyroidism. Glandular hyperplasia (D) refers to an enlargement of the parathyroid glands and can also cause primary hyperparathyroidism, but it is less common than adenoma. Phosphate retention (E) is not a characteristic feature of primary hyperparathyroidism.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents to a psychiatrist for an initial consultation. She reports that for the past 3 years, she has experienced several periods of depressed mood. The episodes do not coincide with any specific life events and seem to resolve after 4-6 weeks. During these episodes, she experiences a depressed mood, sleep disturbances, and a poor appetite, but she at times is able to enjoy spending time with her children and husband but other times she is distressed and cannot enjoy time with them. Upon further questioning, she also reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years. During these episodes, she is very productive at her work as a lawyer and requires less sleep than usual. Her past medical history is notable for obesity, type I diabetes mellitus, and rheumatoid arthritis. She is on insulin and takes methotrexate. She smokes marijuana occasionally. Her temperature is 99.2°F (37.3°C), blood pressure is 124/80 mmHg, pulse is 78/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, she is quiet with a flattened affect, but is cooperative and answers questions thoroughly. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Bipolar I disorder
(B): Bipolar II disorder
(C): Cyclothymic disorder
(D): Persistent depressive disorder
(E): Schizoaffective disorder
",Cyclothymic disorder,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Cyclothymic disorder.

Explanation:
Cyclothymic disorder is a mood disorder characterized by recurrent periods of hypomanic symptoms and depressive symptoms that do not meet the criteria for a full manic or major depressive episode. In this case, the patient reports experiencing occasional episodes of elevated mood over the past ten years, which suggests the presence of hypomanic symptoms. She also reports several periods of depressed mood that resolve after 4-6 weeks, which indicates the presence of depressive symptoms. These symptoms have been present for at least 2 years, which is consistent with the diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder.

Bipolar I disorder is characterized by the presence of at least one manic episode, which is not described in this case. Bipolar II disorder is characterized by the presence of at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but without a history of a full manic episode. While the patient does report hypomanic symptoms, there is no mention of a major depressive episode, which is required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder.

Persistent depressive disorder, also known as dysthymia, is characterized by a chronic depressed mood that lasts for at least 2 years. The patient in this case does not meet the criteria for persistent depressive disorder, as her depressive symptoms resolve after 4-6 weeks.

Schizoaffective disorder is a mood disorder characterized by the presence of both mood symptoms and psychotic symptoms. There is no mention of psychotic symptoms in this case, so schizoaffective disorder is not the most likely diagnosis.",
"A 76-year-old woman comes to the physician for a routine examination. She has a history of hypertension well controlled with diet and exercise. She has no history of smoking or illicit drug use. She walks one mile daily. Her pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 119/76 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. When compared to a healthy 20-year-old woman, which of the following changes in respiratory function is most likely present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Increased lung compliance
(B): Increased vital capacity
(C): Decreased residual volume
(D): Increased chest wall compliance
(E): Decreased A-a gradient
",Increased lung compliance,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Increased lung compliance.

Explanation:
As individuals age, there are several changes that occur in the respiratory system. One of these changes is a decrease in lung compliance, which refers to the ease with which the lungs can expand and contract. However, in this case, the patient is a 76-year-old woman who has a history of hypertension but is otherwise healthy and physically active.

Given that her physical examination shows no abnormalities, it is unlikely that she would have a decrease in lung compliance. Instead, it is more likely that she would have an increase in lung compliance. This means that her lungs are more elastic and can expand and contract more easily.

Increased lung compliance is a normal age-related change and can be attributed to a combination of factors such as decreased chest wall compliance, increased lung elasticity, and changes in the connective tissue of the lungs. These changes can result in increased lung volumes and capacities, such as an increased vital capacity.

Therefore, the most likely change in respiratory function in this patient is increased lung compliance, making option (A) the correct choice.",
"A 32-year-old man jumps off a 3 story building during a suicide attempt. Paramedics arrive quickly, and he is taken to the hospital where several stable lumbar fractures and a shattered right calcaneus are found. He undergoes surgery and his calcaneus is repaired with 11 screws. Which of the following statements best describes the long term post-surgery outcome in this patient?
Options:
(A): He will not be able to plantar flex his foot.
(B): He will not be able to point his toe.
(C): He will have a foot drop.
(D): He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.
(E): He will have pain while dorsiflexing his foot.
",He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): He will have pain with inversion and eversion of his foot.

Explanation:
In this patient with a shattered calcaneus that required surgery and fixation with screws, it is likely that he will experience pain with inversion and eversion of his foot. The calcaneus is an important bone in the foot that helps with stability and movement. Injuries to the calcaneus can result in long-term complications, including pain and limited range of motion.

In this case, the patient's calcaneus was repaired with screws, which may cause discomfort and pain with certain movements, such as inversion and eversion of the foot. Inversion refers to turning the sole of the foot inward, while eversion refers to turning the sole of the foot outward. These movements involve the subtalar joint, which is located between the calcaneus and the talus bone.

The surgery and fixation with screws may result in some restriction of movement and discomfort in the subtalar joint, leading to pain with inversion and eversion of the foot. It is important for the patient to undergo rehabilitation and physical therapy to regain strength and flexibility in the foot and ankle, which may help alleviate some of the pain and improve overall function.",
"A 46-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-week history of fatigue and headache that have gotten progressively worse. He has allergic asthma treated with inhaled salbutamol. He immigrated to the USA from Thailand 9 years ago. He lives by himself and works as a waiter in a restaurant. He has had 6 lifetime male sexual partners and uses condoms inconsistently. He drinks 1–2 beers daily. His temperature is 38.2°C (100.8°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Examination of the mouth shows several white patches on the tongue and oral mucosa that can be easily scraped off with a tongue blade. On mental status examination, the patient is somnolent and has short-term memory deficits. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.6 g/dL
Leukocyte count 9,600/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 80%
Eosinophils 1%

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows a leukocyte count of 25/mm3 (60% lymphocytes), protein concentration of 52 mg/dL, and a glucose concentration of 37 mg/dL. India ink stain shows organisms with prominent capsules. Blood cultures are drawn. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's neurological symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid
(B): Amphotericin B and flucytosine
(C): Fluconazole
(D): Vancomycin and meropenem
(E): Valacyclovir
",Amphotericin B and flucytosine,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Amphotericin B and flucytosine.

The patient's presentation is consistent with cryptococcal meningitis, which is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. The presence of organisms with prominent capsules on India ink stain confirms the diagnosis. Cryptococcal meningitis is an opportunistic infection commonly seen in patients with HIV/AIDS, especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts.

Amphotericin B is the treatment of choice for cryptococcal meningitis. It is a polyene antifungal agent that binds to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane, leading to cell death. Flucytosine is a fluorinated pyrimidine analog that inhibits fungal DNA and RNA synthesis. The combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine has been shown to have synergistic activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and is recommended as the initial treatment for cryptococcal meningitis.

Fluconazole is an alternative treatment option for cryptococcal meningitis, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's neurological symptoms. Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal agent that inhibits fungal cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes, leading to impaired ergosterol synthesis and cell death. It is generally used as maintenance therapy for patients with cryptococcal meningitis after initial treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine.

Vancomycin and meropenem are antibiotics that are not effective against fungal infections and would not be appropriate for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes virus infections. It would not be effective against Cryptococcus neoformans and would not be appropriate for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.",
"A previously healthy 16-year-old boy comes to the physician because of a 5-day history of pain at the back of his left ankle. His mother had a myocardial infarction at 54 years. His BMI is 23 kg/m2. There is tenderness above the left posterior calcaneus and a firm, 3-cm, skin-colored nodule that moves with the left Achilles tendon. A photomicrograph from a biopsy of the nodule is shown. Serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of which of the following?
Options:
(A): Uric acid
(B): Rheumatoid factor
(C): Angiotensin converting enzyme
(D): Low-density lipoprotein
(E): Triglycerides
",Low-density lipoprotein,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Low-density lipoprotein.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and the photomicrograph from the biopsy, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is xanthoma. Xanthomas are benign, lipid-filled nodules that can occur in various locations in the body, including the Achilles tendon. They are typically associated with underlying lipid abnormalities, such as elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

In this case, the patient's mother had a myocardial infarction, which suggests a possible familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol levels. The patient's BMI is within the normal range, so obesity-related dyslipidemia is less likely.

Therefore, serum studies in this patient are most likely to show increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.",
"A 3-year-old boy presents with episodic diarrhea with malodorous stools, stunted growth, occasional abdominal cramps, and an itchy rash. His mother says that these symptoms developed approximately 2 years ago. The patient was exclusively breastfed up to the age of 7 months. Supplementary feeding was started with non-starchy vegetable followed by starchy vegetables, meat, fish, eggs, and bread. Bread and cookies were the last product to be introduced at the age of 12 months. The patient’s mother tried to withdraw dairy products from the patient’s diet because she heard that lactose can cause such symptoms, but it did not help. The patient’s vital signs include: blood pressure 90/55 mm Hg, heart rate 101/min, respiratory rate 19/min, and temperature 36.3℃ (97.3℉). His weight is 11 kg (24.2 lb, -2 SD) and height is 90 cm (2 ft 11 in, -1 SD). On physical examination, the patient’s skin is pale with a papulovesicular rash on his abdomen and back. There are a few aphthous ulcers in the oral cavity. The abdomen is distended but no tenderness to palpation. No hepatosplenomegaly. An immunological assay is performed and shows positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies. Which of the following changes would you most likely expect to see on intestinal biopsy in this patient?
Options:
(A): Granulomas in the submucous tissue
(B): Crypt abscesses
(C): Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy
(D): Mucosal eosinophilia
(E): Villous hyperplasia
",Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation and positive anti-transglutaminase and anti-endomysial antibodies in this patient are consistent with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune-mediated reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. In celiac disease, the immune response leads to damage of the small intestinal mucosa, specifically the villi.

Intestinal biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing celiac disease. The characteristic histological findings in celiac disease include villous atrophy and crypt hypertrophy. Villous atrophy refers to the flattening or blunting of the small intestinal villi, which results in a decrease in the absorptive surface area. Crypt hypertrophy refers to an increase in the depth of the crypts of Lieberkühn, which are invaginations between the villi. These changes are seen in the small intestine, particularly in the duodenum and proximal jejunum.

Granulomas in the submucous tissue (option A) are not typically seen in celiac disease. Granulomas are more commonly associated with conditions such as Crohn's disease or tuberculosis.

Crypt abscesses (option B) are not a characteristic finding in celiac disease. Crypt abscesses are more commonly seen in inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis.

Mucosal eosinophilia (option D) refers to an increased number of eosinophils in the mucosa. While eosinophilia can be seen in various gastrointestinal disorders, it is not a specific finding in celiac disease.

Villous hyperplasia (option E) refers to an increase in the height and number of the villi. This finding is not typically seen in celiac disease, as the characteristic histological changes involve villous atrophy. Villous hyperplasia can be seen in conditions such as tropical sprue or giardiasis.",
"An 18-year-old patient is visiting the pediatrician with her mother for her annual exam before college starts. Her height and weight are appropriate for her age, and she is up to date on all her vaccinations and has no medical complaints. She is doing well in school and has a part-time job stocking shelves at a clothing store. She was offered a higher-paying job as a cashier at the store, but she declined. She is very shy and withdrawn with the physician. Afterwards, her mother asks to speak to the physician alone and expresses concern that her daughter is very socially isolated and feels lonely. She is also worried that her daughter is extremely sensitive to criticism, even from family. The daughter is interested in art and music, but hasn’t participated in any extracurriculars because she says that she is untalented and thinks nobody wants to hang out with her. When her mother has encouraged her to invite friends over, the daughter bursts into tears and says, “Nobody wants to be friends with me, I am too lame and ugly and I just know I’ll end up getting rejected.” Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the daughter’s behavior?
Options:
(A): Schizotypal personality disorder
(B): Generalized anxiety disorder
(C): Avoidant personality disorder
(D): Paranoid personality disorder
(E): Dependent personality disorder
",Avoidant personality disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Avoidant personality disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's behavior and symptoms are consistent with avoidant personality disorder. Avoidant personality disorder is characterized by a pervasive pattern of social inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and hypersensitivity to negative evaluation. Individuals with this disorder often avoid social interactions and fear rejection or criticism. They may have a limited social network and feel lonely or isolated. The patient's shyness, withdrawal, and reluctance to participate in extracurricular activities due to fear of rejection are indicative of avoidant personality disorder. Additionally, her extreme sensitivity to criticism and negative self-perception further support this diagnosis.",
"A 15-year-old girl comes to the physician because of a 2-week history of genital lesions. She has no history of serious illness. She is sexually active with 2 male partners and uses condoms inconsistently. Vital signs are within normal limits. Pelvic examination shows multiple hyperkeratotic exophytic papules over the vulva. The lesions turn white on application of 3% acetic acid. Which of the following is most likely to have prevented this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Condoms
(B): Anti-HIV prophylaxis
(C): Spermicidal foam
(D): Famciclovir therapy
(E): Vaccination
",Vaccination,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Vaccination.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of multiple hyperkeratotic exophytic papules over the vulva that turn white on application of 3% acetic acid is consistent with genital warts, which are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV is a sexually transmitted infection, and the most common risk factor for acquiring HPV is unprotected sexual activity. 

While condoms can reduce the risk of HPV transmission, they are not 100% effective in preventing it. Condoms primarily protect against sexually transmitted infections that are transmitted through bodily fluids, but HPV can also be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact in the genital area. Therefore, inconsistent condom use would not have completely prevented this patient's condition.

Anti-HIV prophylaxis is used to prevent HIV infection, not HPV infection.

Spermicidal foam is a contraceptive method that can help prevent pregnancy, but it does not protect against HPV infection.

Famciclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, not HPV infections.

Vaccination is the most effective method for preventing HPV infection. The HPV vaccine is recommended for both males and females, starting at age 11 or 12, before sexual activity begins. It is most effective when given before exposure to the virus. The vaccine protects against the most common types of HPV that cause genital warts and certain types of cancer, including cervical cancer. Therefore, vaccination would have been the most likely method to prevent this patient's condition.",
"A 48-year-old woman comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Two weeks ago, while visiting Guatemala, she had an emergency appendectomy under general inhalational anesthesia. During the surgery, she received a transfusion of 1 unit of packed red blood cells. Her temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F) and blood pressure is 138/76 mm Hg. Examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show:
Alkaline phosphatase 102 U/L
Aspartate aminotransferase 760 U/L
Bilirubin
Total 3.8 mg/dL
Direct 3.1 mg/dL
Anti-HAV IgG positive
Anti-HAV IgM negative
Anti-HBs positive
HBsAg negative
Anti-HCV antibodies negative
Abdominal ultrasonography shows an enlarged liver. A biopsy of the liver shows massive centrilobular necrosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition?""
Options:
(A): Acalculous inflammation of the gallbladder
(B): Virus-mediated hepatocellular injury
(C): Trauma to the bile duct
(D): Adverse effect of anesthetic
(E): Gram-negative bacteria in the bloodstream
",Adverse effect of anesthetic,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Adverse effect of anesthetic.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, and hepatomegaly, along with the laboratory findings of elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase) and bilirubin, suggests hepatocellular injury. The biopsy findings of massive centrilobular necrosis further support this. The most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is an adverse effect of the anesthetic used during her appendectomy. Anesthetic-induced hepatotoxicity is a rare but well-documented complication, characterized by hepatocellular injury and liver dysfunction. The mechanism of injury is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to the metabolism of the anesthetic agents or their metabolites. The presentation typically occurs within days to weeks after exposure to the anesthetic and is characterized by fever, jaundice, and hepatomegaly. Laboratory findings often show elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. In severe cases, liver failure can occur. In this patient, the timing of the symptoms and the history of recent surgery and anesthesia strongly suggest an adverse effect of the anesthetic as the underlying cause of her condition.",
"A 10-year-old African American girl with known sickle cell disease becomes acutely anemic in the setting of underlying infection. Her mother denies any previous history of blood clots in her past, but she says that her mother has also had to be treated for pulmonary embolism in the recent past. The patient’s past medical history is significant for a few episodes of acute pain crisis and a need for splenectomy 3 years ago. The vital signs upon arrival include: temperature 36.7°C (98.0°F), blood pressure 106/74 mm Hg, heart rate 111/min and regular, and respiratory rate 17/min. On physical examination, her pulses are bounding and fingernails are pale, but breath sounds remain clear. Oxygen saturation was initially 91% on room air and electrocardiogram (ECG) shows sinus tachycardia. A blood transfusion is initiated. Shortly after the transfusion has begun, the patient experiences fevers, chills, a burning sensation at the intravenous (IV) site, and sudden hypotension. What is the name of this reaction, and what is the best treatment?
Options:
(A): Minor allergic reaction; administer antihistamines
(B): Nonhemolytic febrile reaction; administer antihistamines
(C): Minor allergic reaction; discontinue transfusion
(D): Hemolytic transfusion reaction; administer antihistamines
(E): Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion
",Hemolytic transfusion reaction,Incorrect, discontinue transfusion,"The correct answer is (E): Hemolytic transfusion reaction; discontinue transfusion.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of fevers, chills, burning sensation at the IV site, and sudden hypotension shortly after the blood transfusion has begun, the most likely diagnosis is a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Hemolytic transfusion reactions occur when there is a mismatch between the donor and recipient blood types, leading to the destruction of red blood cells and the release of hemoglobin into the bloodstream. This can trigger an immune response and cause symptoms such as fever, chills, hypotension, and in severe cases, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

The best treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction is to immediately discontinue the transfusion. This is important to prevent further destruction of red blood cells and worsening of symptoms. Supportive care should be provided, including fluid resuscitation if necessary, and close monitoring of vital signs and urine output. The patient may require additional interventions based on the severity of the reaction, such as treatment for hypotension or DIC.

Administering antihistamines, as mentioned in options (A) and (D), would not be the appropriate treatment for a hemolytic transfusion reaction. Antihistamines are used to treat allergic reactions, which can present with symptoms such as hives, itching, and respiratory distress. However, in a hemolytic transfusion reaction, the symptoms are primarily due to the destruction of red blood cells and the release of hemoglobin, not an allergic response.

Option (B) suggests a nonhemolytic febrile reaction, which can occur during a blood transfusion and is characterized by fever without evidence of hemolysis. Nonhemolytic febrile reactions are usually caused by cytokines present in the donor blood and are not associated with hemolysis or the release of hemoglobin. The treatment for nonhemolytic febrile reactions is supportive, including administration of antipyretics such as acetaminophen.

Option (C) suggests a minor allergic reaction and recommends discontinuing the transfusion. While it is important to discontinue the transfusion in any suspected transfusion reaction, the symptoms described in the scenario (fevers, chills, burning sensation, sudden hypotension) are more consistent with a hemolytic transfusion reaction rather than a minor allergic reaction."
"A 46-year-old woman comes to the physician because of severe muscle and joint pain for 5 months. The pain varies in location and intensity. She also has joint stiffness in the morning and reports fatigue throughout the day that she attributes to not sleeping well. She reports a tingling sensation in her lower limbs. Her bowel habits are unchanged but she often feels bloated. She has primary hypertension and occasional migraine headaches. She does not smoke or consume alcohol. Her medications include propranolol and sumatriptan. She appears healthy. Examination shows symmetric muscular tenderness at the base of the neck, over the shoulders, and in the lumbosacral area. Strength and deep tendon reflexes are normal. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 14.3 g/dL
Leukocyte count 9300/mm3
Platelet count 230,000/mm3
Mean corpuscular volume 85 μm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 12 mm/h
Serum
Glucose 92 mg/dL
Creatinine 0.6 mg/dL
TSH 3.1 μU/mL
Urinalysis is within normal limits. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient?""
Options:
(A): Bupropion
(B): Temazepam
(C): Vitamin B12
(D): Amitriptyline
(E): Methotrexate
""
",Amitriptyline,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Amitriptyline.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, she is most likely experiencing fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances. The pain is often described as aching, burning, or throbbing and can vary in location and intensity. Joint stiffness in the morning is also a common symptom. The tingling sensation in the lower limbs may be due to associated peripheral neuropathy.

The patient's laboratory studies are within normal limits, ruling out other potential causes of her symptoms. Fibromyalgia is a clinical diagnosis and there are no specific diagnostic tests for it.

Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is the most appropriate therapy for this patient. It is commonly used in the management of fibromyalgia to help improve sleep, reduce pain, and alleviate fatigue. Amitriptyline has sedating properties, which can help with sleep disturbances. It also has analgesic effects that can help reduce the musculoskeletal pain associated with fibromyalgia.

Bupropion (A) is an antidepressant that is not typically used as a first-line treatment for fibromyalgia. It may be considered as an alternative option if the patient does not tolerate or respond to amitriptyline.

Temazepam (B) is a benzodiazepine that is used for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While sleep disturbances are common in fibromyalgia, temazepam alone would not address the other symptoms of fibromyalgia such as musculoskeletal pain and fatigue.

Vitamin B12 (C) deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with fibromyalgia. Vitamin B12 supplementation would not be the most appropriate therapy in this case.

Methotrexate (E) is a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) that is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. It is not indicated for the treatment of fibromyalgia.",
"A 68-year-old man presents with difficulty breathing for the last 3 hours. Upon asking about other symptoms, he mentions that he had a cough for the last 4 months which he attributes to his smoking. He says he had frequent nasal stuffiness and headaches over the last 3 months, for which he takes over-the-counter cold medications and analgesics. Over the last 2 months, he often felt that his face was mildly swollen, especially in the morning hours, but he did not consider it to be anything serious. No significant past medical history. He reports a 20-pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 36.8°C (98.4°F), pulse is 96/min, blood pressure is 108/78 mm Hg, and the respiratory rate is 24/min. On physical examination, auscultation of the chest reveals rhonchi and crepitus over the right lung. The remainder of the exam is unremarkable. A chest radiograph reveals a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung. Which of the following clinical signs would most likely be present in this patient?
Options:
(A): Bilateral pedal edema
(B): Distended veins over lower abdomen
(C): Papilledema
(D): Positive Adson test
(E): Sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of right forearm and right hand
",Papilledema,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Papilledema.

Explanation:
Papilledema refers to swelling of the optic disc, which is the point where the optic nerve enters the eye. It is typically caused by increased intracranial pressure. In this patient, the presence of a mass in the middle lobe of the right lung suggests a possible lung cancer that has metastasized to the brain, leading to increased intracranial pressure. The patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing, cough, nasal stuffiness, and headaches are consistent with this diagnosis. The mild facial swelling reported by the patient may also be a sign of increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, the most likely clinical sign to be present in this patient is papilledema.",
"A 40-year-old obese man with a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease presents with one day of excruciating pain, swelling, and redness in his greater toe. He denies any inciting trauma or similar prior episodes. Vital signs are stable. On examination, the right first toe is grossly erythematous and edematous, with range of motion limited due to pain. Deposition of which of the following is associated with the most likely underlying joint disorder?
Options:
(A): Cholesterol
(B): Calcium phosphate
(C): Calcium oxalate
(D): Monosodium urate
(E): Copper
",Monosodium urate,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Monosodium urate.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation described in the question is consistent with acute gouty arthritis, which is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint. Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis that occurs due to the accumulation of uric acid in the blood, leading to the formation of urate crystals in the joints and surrounding tissues.

Gout commonly affects the lower extremity joints, especially the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the joint at the base of the big toe), which is known as podagra. The symptoms of gout typically include sudden onset of severe pain, swelling, redness, and limited range of motion in the affected joint.

The patient in this case has a history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease, which are both risk factors for developing gout. Diabetes is associated with insulin resistance, which can lead to increased uric acid levels. Chronic kidney disease impairs the excretion of uric acid, leading to its accumulation in the blood.

The deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joint triggers an inflammatory response, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of gout. The crystals can be visualized under a microscope using polarized light, and their presence confirms the diagnosis of gout.

In summary, the deposition of monosodium urate crystals is associated with the most likely underlying joint disorder in this patient, which is acute gouty arthritis.",
"An obese 42-year-old female presents to her primary care physician with a complaint of left knee pain for the past 3 months. She describes the pain as affecting the inside part of the knee as well as the front of her knee, below the kneecap. She denies any inciting injury or trauma to the knee but reports that the pain is worse when she is climbing up stairs or rising from a chair. Physical examination is significant for localized tenderness to palpation over the left anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line. There is no joint effusion noted. Valgus stress testing is negative for any pain or instability of the knee joint. Radiographs of the left knee are obtained and reveal only mild arthritis, without evidence of any fractures or bony lesions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Stress fracture of proximal tibia
(B): Medial meniscus tear
(C): Medical collateral ligament (MCL) sprain
(D): Pes anserine bursitis
(E): Patellar tendonitis
",Pes anserine bursitis,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Pes anserine bursitis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is pes anserine bursitis. Pes anserine bursitis is inflammation of the bursa located between the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles and the underlying tibia. It commonly presents with pain on the inside part of the knee, below the kneecap, and can be exacerbated by activities such as climbing stairs or rising from a chair, which involve flexion of the knee. Physical examination findings of localized tenderness over the anteromedial proximal tibia, 6 cm inferior to the joint line, are consistent with pes anserine bursitis. There is no joint effusion noted, which helps to differentiate it from other causes of knee pain such as a meniscus tear or ligament sprain. Radiographs of the knee showing only mild arthritis without evidence of fractures or bony lesions further support the diagnosis of pes anserine bursitis. Treatment for pes anserine bursitis includes rest, ice, physical therapy, and potentially a glucocorticoid injection.",
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician’s office with concerns about a recent pregnancy. She and her boyfriend had intercourse for the first time a few weeks ago. Two weeks ago she missed her menstrual period. She took several over the counter pregnancy tests that confirmed her pregnancy. She is tearful about the pregnancy and is very concerned. After extensive conversations with her physician and counseling, she decides she wants to medically abort her 6-week pregnancy. Which of the following drugs should be administered to this patient for this purpose?
Options:
(A): Megestrol
(B): Tamoxifen
(C): Terbutaline
(D): Mifepristone
(E): Copper intrauterine device
",Mifepristone,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Mifepristone.

Explanation:
Mifepristone is a medication used for medical abortion, which is the termination of pregnancy through the use of medications. It is commonly used in combination with misoprostol. Mifepristone works by blocking the hormone progesterone, which is necessary for maintaining pregnancy. Without progesterone, the lining of the uterus breaks down, leading to the detachment of the embryo and the initiation of uterine contractions.

In this case, the patient is 6 weeks pregnant and has decided to medically abort the pregnancy. Mifepristone, along with misoprostol, is the recommended medication regimen for pregnancies of less than 10 weeks. The patient would take the mifepristone tablet first, followed by the misoprostol tablets 1 to 2 days later. The misoprostol can be taken orally or placed in the vagina.

It is important to note that the administration of mifepristone and misoprostol for medical abortion should be done under the guidance and supervision of a healthcare provider. The patient should also receive counseling and information about the procedure, including expected effects and possible side effects.",
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of periodic painful double vision for 3 days. Her symptoms occur only when looking sideways. She has myopia and has been wearing corrective lenses for 10 years. Ten days ago, she lost her balance and fell off her bike, for which she went to a hospital. A CT scan of the head at that time showed no abnormalities and she was released without further treatment. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. Her best corrected visual acuity is 20/40 in each eye. She has an adduction deficit in the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye when looking left; she has an adduction deficit in the left eye and nystagmus in the right eye when looking right. Fundoscopy reveals bilateral disc hyperemia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?
Options:
(A): Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus
(B): Compressive tumor of the pons
(C): Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency
(D): Subdural hematoma extending into the orbit
(E): Infarction of the brainstem
",Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Demyelination of the medial longitudinal fasciculus.

The patient's symptoms of painful double vision that occur only when looking sideways, along with the findings of adduction deficit in one eye and nystagmus in the opposite eye when looking in the corresponding direction, are consistent with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO). INO is caused by a lesion in the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF), which is responsible for coordinating eye movements. 

In this case, the most likely cause of the patient's findings is demyelination of the MLF. This is supported by the patient's history of myopia, which is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system. The patient's symptoms of double vision and the presence of bilateral disc hyperemia on fundoscopy further support the possibility of MS.

The other options are less likely based on the given information. A compressive tumor of the pons (option B) would typically cause more widespread neurological symptoms and signs, not just isolated eye movement abnormalities. Oxidative damage due to thiamine deficiency (option C) would not typically present with these specific eye findings. A subdural hematoma extending into the orbit (option D) would be unlikely to cause isolated eye movement abnormalities without other neurological symptoms. Infarction of the brainstem (option E) would also typically present with more widespread neurological deficits.",
"A 63-year-old man presents to the clinic for left calf pain when walking a distance of more than 200 m. He has had this pain for more than 8 months now, and he rates it as 7 out of 10. The pain subsides with rest. The patient has had a history of diabetes mellitus for the past 2 years which is well controlled. A percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 2014. His current medications are insulin and aspirin. Family history is significant for coronary artery disease. He has an 80 pack-year history of smoking and currently smokes. He consumes 4 drinks per day of alcohol. On physical examination, his blood pressure is 144/89 mm Hg, the heart rate is 80/min and regular, the breathing rate is 25/min, and the pulse oximetry is 96%. Normal cardiac and lung sounds were heard on auscultation. Which of the following is the appropriate treatment to improve the patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Cilostazol
(B): Pentoxifylline
(C): Femoral embolectomy
(D): Femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft
(E): Interventional endovascular treatment
",Cilostazol,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Cilostazol.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of left calf pain when walking a distance of more than 200 m, which subsides with rest, are consistent with intermittent claudication. Intermittent claudication is a symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is caused by atherosclerosis and results in reduced blood flow to the lower extremities. The patient's risk factors for PAD include a history of diabetes mellitus, smoking, and a family history of coronary artery disease.

Cilostazol is a medication that improves symptoms and increases walking distance in patients with intermittent claudication. It is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that acts as a vasodilator and antiplatelet agent. Cilostazol improves blood flow to the lower extremities and reduces platelet aggregation, thereby improving symptoms of intermittent claudication.

Pentoxifylline is another medication that can be used to improve symptoms in patients with intermittent claudication. It is a methylxanthine derivative that improves blood flow by reducing blood viscosity and increasing red blood cell deformability. However, cilostazol is generally considered to be more effective than pentoxifylline in improving symptoms and increasing walking distance.

Femoral embolectomy and femoral-to-popliteal bypass graft are surgical procedures that may be considered in patients with severe PAD and critical limb ischemia. These procedures are not appropriate for the patient in this case, as his symptoms are not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention.

Interventional endovascular treatment, such as angioplasty or stenting, may be considered in patients with PAD who have severe symptoms or who do not respond to medical therapy. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant interventional treatment.

Therefore, the appropriate treatment to improve the patient's symptoms of intermittent claudication is cilostazol.",
"A 72-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 1-month history of frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias. Physical examination shows pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 65 mm/h. Temporal artery biopsy shows transmural granulomatous inflammation and fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina. Treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids is begun. The patient's condition puts her at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications?
Options:
(A): Pulmonary hypertension
(B): Lower extremity gangrene
(C): Palpable purpura
(D): Posterior uveitis
(E): Thoracic aortic aneurysm
",Thoracic aortic aneurysm,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Thoracic aortic aneurysm.

Explanation:
Temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis, is a systemic vasculitis that primarily affects medium and large-sized arteries, particularly the branches of the carotid artery. It commonly involves the temporal arteries, which can lead to symptoms such as headache, jaw claudication, and visual disturbances. 

In this case, the patient's condition is characterized by symptoms such as frequent headaches, double vision, fatigue, and myalgias, along with physical examination findings of pallor, tenderness to palpation over the temples, and inward deviation of the left eye. Laboratory studies show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and temporal artery biopsy confirms the diagnosis of temporal arteritis.

One of the potential complications of temporal arteritis is the development of thoracic aortic aneurysm. The inflammation and damage to the arterial wall can weaken the aorta, leading to the formation of an aneurysm. This can be a life-threatening condition if the aneurysm ruptures or dissects.

While the other options may be associated with other conditions or complications, such as pulmonary hypertension in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower extremity gangrene in peripheral arterial disease, palpable purpura in vasculitis, and posterior uveitis in other inflammatory conditions, they are not specifically associated with temporal arteritis. Therefore, the correct answer is thoracic aortic aneurysm.",
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician because of yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination for the past 6 days. Three weeks ago, she had an episode of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis that was treated with a 10-day course of amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with multiple male partners over the past year and uses condoms inconsistently; she has been taking an oral contraceptive for the past 2 years. She has no previous history of serious illness or sexually transmitted diseases. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 75/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 122/82 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 5.8. Bimanual examination is unremarkable. Further evaluation of this patient's vaginal discharge is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Obligate intracellular organisms
(B): Gram-negative diplococci
(C): Positive whiff test
(D): Pseudohyphae
(E): Flagellated protozoa
",Flagellated protozoa,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Flagellated protozoa.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including yellow vaginal discharge, pruritus, and pain with urination, along with the physical examination findings of erythema of the vulva and vagina and foul-smelling, frothy, yellow-green vaginal discharge, are consistent with a diagnosis of trichomoniasis. Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas vaginalis.

The pH of the discharge is 5.8, which is higher than the normal vaginal pH of 3.8-4.5. This elevated pH is a characteristic finding in trichomoniasis.

Further evaluation of the vaginal discharge, such as microscopic examination, is likely to show the presence of flagellated protozoa, specifically Trichomonas vaginalis. These protozoa can be visualized under the microscope, and their presence confirms the diagnosis of trichomoniasis.

The other options are not consistent with the clinical presentation and findings of trichomoniasis. Obligate intracellular organisms are seen in infections such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, which typically present with different symptoms and physical examination findings. Gram-negative diplococci are seen in infections such as gonorrhea, which again have different symptoms and physical examination findings. The positive whiff test is associated with bacterial vaginosis, which typically presents with a different type of vaginal discharge. Pseudohyphae are seen in infections such as candidiasis, which also have different symptoms and physical examination findings.",
"A 15-year-old female presents to her pediatrician’s office for severe menstrual cramping. The patient underwent menarche at age 11, and her periods were irregular every 2-3 months for two years. After that, her cycles became roughly regular every 28-35 days, but she has had extremely painful cramps and often has to miss school. The cramps are intermittent and feel like a dull ache in the center of her abdomen, and there is usually accompanying back pain. The patient has been using heating pads with limited relief. She reports some periods being “really heavy” and requires a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities. She denies any bowel or bladder changes. The patient had normal development throughout childhood, is on the soccer team at school, and is not sexually active. Her father has hypertension and her mother has endometriosis and heavy periods. On exam, the patient is 5 feet 5 inches and weighs 158 pounds (BMI 26.3 kg/m^2). She is well appearing and has no abdominal tenderness. She has Tanner IV breasts and Tanner IV pubic hair, and external genitalia are normal. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient’s menstrual cramps?
Options:
(A): Von Willebrand factor antigen assay
(B): Pelvic ultrasound
(C): MRI of the pelvis
(D): NSAIDs
(E): Increased exercise
",NSAIDs,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) NSAIDs.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is primary dysmenorrhea. Primary dysmenorrhea is characterized by suprapubic/low back cramping or pain occurring at or near the onset of menstrual flow, lasting for 8 to 72 hours. The pain is often described as a dull ache in the center of the abdomen, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. The patient also reports heavy periods, requiring a superabsorbent pad every 6 hours for 2 days each cycle, but this does not limit her activities.

The first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, are effective in relieving menstrual cramps by reducing prostaglandin production and decreasing uterine contractions. The patient has already been using heating pads with limited relief, suggesting that NSAIDs may provide better pain control.

The other options are not indicated in this patient's case:
(A) Von Willebrand factor antigen assay: This test is used to evaluate for von Willebrand disease, a bleeding disorder. It is not indicated in this patient as her symptoms are consistent with primary dysmenorrhea, not a bleeding disorder.
(B) Pelvic ultrasound: Pelvic ultrasound is not necessary for the evaluation of primary dysmenorrhea. It may be indicated if there are additional symptoms or findings suggestive of another underlying condition, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids, but there is no indication for it in this patient.
(C) MRI of the pelvis: MRI of the pelvis is not necessary for the evaluation of primary dysmenorrhea. It may be indicated if there are additional symptoms or findings suggestive of another underlying condition, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids, but there is no indication for it in this patient.
(E) Increased exercise: While regular exercise can have many health benefits, including potentially reducing menstrual cramps, it is not the best next step for this patient. NSAIDs are the first-line treatment for primary dysmenorrhea and should be tried before considering other interventions.",
"A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which she was the restrained driver. On arrival, she has a cervical collar in place and is unresponsive. Her temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 70/min, and blood pressure is 131/76 mm Hg. Her pupils are dilated and not reactive to light. She is unresponsive to noxious stimuli. She is intubated, and mechanical ventilation is begun. Serum concentrations of electrolytes, urea nitrogen, and creatinine are within the reference range. Toxicology screening is negative. A CT scan of the head without contrast shows a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury at the level of C3. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death?
Options:
(A): Electroencephalography
(B): Magnetic resonance angiography
(C): Deep tendon reflex testing
(D): Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography
(E): Corneal reflex test
",Corneal reflex test,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Corneal reflex test.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has suffered a high-speed motor vehicle collision resulting in a massive intracranial bleed and a cervical spine injury. She is unresponsive, with dilated and non-reactive pupils. These findings are concerning for brain death.

The corneal reflex test is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death. The corneal reflex is mediated by the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) and the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). It involves touching the cornea with a cotton swab or a wisp of cotton, which should elicit a blink response. In brain death, there is absent corneal reflex due to the loss of brainstem function.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this scenario. EEG measures the electrical activity of the brain and can be used to assess brain function. However, in brain death, there is a complete absence of electrical activity on EEG.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this scenario. MRA is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the blood vessels. It is not specific for diagnosing brain death.

Deep tendon reflex testing is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this scenario. Deep tendon reflexes, such as the patellar reflex, are assessed by tapping the tendon with a reflex hammer. In brain death, there is absent deep tendon reflexes due to the loss of brainstem function. However, the corneal reflex test is a more specific and reliable test for diagnosing brain death.

Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this scenario. Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography uses ultrasound to assess blood flow in the intracranial vessels. While it can be used to assess cerebral blood flow, it is not specific for diagnosing brain death.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in diagnosing brain death in this scenario is the corneal reflex test.",
"A previously healthy 17-year-old female college student comes to the emergency department because of a 1-day history of fever, chills, and severe headache. Her temperature is 39.4°C (103°F). Physical examination shows nuchal rigidity and photophobia. Blood cultures are obtained and a lumbar puncture is performed. A Gram stain of cerebrospinal fluid shows gram-negative cocci in pairs. Which of the following virulence factors was most likely involved in the initial step of this patient's infection?
Options:
(A): Protein A
(B): Lipooligosaccharides
(C): Adhesive pili
(D): Biofilm formation
(E): Polysaccharide capsule
",Adhesive pili,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Adhesive pili.

Explanation:
The presence of gram-negative cocci in pairs in the cerebrospinal fluid suggests that the patient is likely infected with Neisseria meningitidis, which is a common cause of bacterial meningitis. Adhesive pili are hair-like structures on the surface of bacteria that allow them to adhere to host cells and tissues. In the case of Neisseria meningitidis, adhesive pili play a crucial role in the initial step of infection by allowing the bacteria to attach to and colonize the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract, which is the primary site of infection. Once attached, the bacteria can then invade the bloodstream and cross the blood-brain barrier, leading to meningitis. Therefore, adhesive pili are the most likely virulence factor involved in the initial step of this patient's infection.",
"A 74-year-old man was admitted to the intensive care ward due to progressive dyspnea, cough with pink sputum, and diaphoresis. He had 2 myocardial infarctions at the age of 66 and 69 years and suffers from chronic heart failure. At the time of presentation, his vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 108/min, respiratory rate 29/min, and temperature 35.5°C (95.9°F). On physical examination, the patient sits upright. He is lethargic and cyanotic. Lung auscultation reveals widespread bilateral fine rales. Cardiac examination is significant for S3, accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2, and a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart. Soon after hospitalization, the patient develops ventricular fibrillation and dies despite adequate resuscitation measures. Which microscopic finding would you expect to see in this patient on autopsy?
Options:
(A): Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining
(B): Areas with 'ghost cells' surrounded by macrophages in the cardiac tissue
(C): Positive Prussian-blue staining of the kidney tissue
(D): Ground-glass hepatocytes
(E): Positive Congo-red staining of the cardiac tissue
",Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining,Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and history, the most likely cause of his symptoms and subsequent death is acute pulmonary edema due to heart failure. The patient has a history of chronic heart failure and presents with symptoms such as dyspnea, cough with pink sputum (indicating pulmonary edema), and diaphoresis. The physical examination findings of cyanosis, fine rales on lung auscultation, and accentuation of the pulmonic component of S2 are consistent with acute pulmonary edema.

In acute pulmonary edema, there is an accumulation of fluid in the alveoli of the lungs, leading to impaired gas exchange and respiratory distress. This can be caused by a sudden increase in left ventricular filling pressures, often due to exacerbation of underlying heart failure or acute myocardial infarction.

On autopsy, the microscopic finding that would be expected in this patient is brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining. These brownish inclusions are known as heart failure cells or hemosiderin-laden macrophages. They are formed when red blood cells leak into the alveoli due to increased pulmonary capillary pressure and are subsequently phagocytosed by macrophages. The hemosiderin pigment within the macrophages gives them a brownish appearance.

Therefore, the presence of brownish inclusions in the pulmonary macrophages on H&E staining would confirm the diagnosis of acute pulmonary edema due to heart failure in this patient.",

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?""
""Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

Options:
(A): Pearson correlation analysis
(B): Chi-square test
(C): Analysis of variance
(D): Meta-analysis
(E): Kaplan-Meier analysis
",Analysis of variance,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Analysis of variance.

Explanation: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups in this study. ANOVA is used to compare the means of three or more groups and determine if there are statistically significant differences between them. In this study, there are three groups: pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, and placebo. The researchers want to compare the changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores between these groups.

ANOVA allows for the comparison of multiple groups simultaneously and can determine if there are significant differences between any of the groups. It is commonly used in clinical trials and experimental studies to analyze the effects of different interventions or treatments.

In this study, the researchers want to determine if the changes in the measured variables (plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores) are statistically significant between the three groups. ANOVA will provide the necessary statistical analysis to determine if there are significant differences in these variables among the groups.

Therefore, the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups in this study is Analysis of variance (ANOVA).",
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician because of intermittent episodes of heart palpitations for 3 weeks. The palpitations are accompanied by chest pain that is sharp and localized to the left 3rd intercostal space. The patient does not smoke. She drinks one to two glasses of wine on the weekends. She appears nervous. Her pulse is 110/min and irregularly irregular, and blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Examination shows a fine tremor on both hands and digital swelling. There is retraction of the left upper eyelid. A systolic ejection murmur is heard along the right upper sternal border. The extremities are warm, and pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?
Options:
(A): Propranolol
(B): Digoxin
(C): Amiodarone
(D): Warfarin
(E): Diltiazem
",Propranolol,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Propranolol.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, she is most likely experiencing atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is characterized by an irregularly irregular pulse, which is seen in this patient. The chest pain localized to the left 3rd intercostal space may be due to the rapid and irregular ventricular response in AF. The fine tremor on both hands, digital swelling, and retraction of the left upper eyelid are consistent with hyperthyroidism, which can be a cause of AF. The systolic ejection murmur along the right upper sternal border may be due to increased blood flow through the aortic valve in hyperthyroidism.

Propranolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can be used to control the ventricular rate in AF. It works by blocking the beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, reducing the effects of sympathetic stimulation and slowing down the heart rate. Propranolol is particularly useful in patients with hyperthyroidism, as it can also help to alleviate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as tremor and anxiety.

Digoxin is not the most appropriate pharmacotherapy in this case because it primarily affects the atrioventricular (AV) node and is not as effective in controlling the ventricular rate in AF. It is more commonly used in patients with AF and heart failure.

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic medication that can be used to convert AF to normal sinus rhythm, but it is not the first-line treatment for controlling the ventricular rate in AF. It is typically reserved for patients who are not responsive to other medications or who have significant structural heart disease.

Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication that is used to prevent thromboembolic complications in patients with AF. While anticoagulation is an important consideration in AF, it is not the most appropriate initial pharmacotherapy for this patient.

Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that can also be used to control the ventricular rate in AF. However, in this patient with hyperthyroidism, propranolol would be a better choice as it can also help to alleviate the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is propranolol (choice A).",
"A 78-year-old right-handed man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for sudden onset speech changes. The patient lives with his daughter and was chatting with her when suddenly his speech became distorted with random and disconnected words that made no sense. He seems to be physically frustrated that no one understands him. Physical examination demonstrates weakness of the right arm. Damage to which location would best explain this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Left frontal lobe
(B): Left internal capsule
(C): Left temporal lobe
(D): Right frontal lobe
(E): Right temporal lobe
",Left frontal lobe,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Left frontal lobe.

Explanation:
The patient's sudden onset speech changes, characterized by distorted and nonsensical words, along with frustration and difficulty in being understood, suggest a language disorder known as expressive aphasia or Broca's aphasia. This type of aphasia is typically caused by damage to the left frontal lobe, specifically in the region known as Broca's area.

Broca's area, located in the posterior part of the left frontal lobe, is responsible for the production of speech and the coordination of the muscles involved in speech production. Damage to this area can result in difficulty in forming words and sentences, leading to the symptoms described in the patient.

Additionally, the presence of weakness in the right arm suggests that the damage may extend beyond Broca's area to involve the adjacent motor cortex in the left frontal lobe. This can explain the weakness observed in the patient's right arm.

Therefore, the most likely location of damage in this patient, based on the symptoms described, is the left frontal lobe (option A).",
"A 68-year-old woman presents with an intermittent throbbing headache with an onset approximately 3 weeks ago. The pain is bilateral, “band-like,” and extends to the neck. The patient rates the 4 points out of 10 on a visual scale. The headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia, and is not aggravated by movements, but gets worse when the patient coughs or laughs. The headache has persisted throughout the day and is usually worse in the morning an hour after she has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient was diagnosed with stage 1 arterial hypertension 2 years ago and stable angina pectoris 3 weeks ago. Currently, she takes aspirin (81 mg once daily), rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), lisinopril (20 mg once daily), and isosorbide mononitrate (60 mg once daily). She has been menopausal for the last 15 years. In addition to her chief complaint, she also notes that she had a runny nose with a temperature elevation approximately 3 weeks ago, and her headache was linked to that acute illness. The vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 135/80 mm Hg, heart rate 76/min, respiratory rate 14/min, and temperature 36.5℃ (97.7℉). The physical examination reveals S2 accentuation that is best heard in the second intercostal space at the right sternal border. Palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless. The neurologic exam shows no focal symptoms, no pain on palpation of the trigeminal points, and no meningeal symptoms. What is the most likely mechanism underlying the patient’s headaches?
Options:
(A): Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma
(B): Dissection of an intracerebral vessel
(C): Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses
(D): Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm
(E): Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles
",Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Dilation of the intracerebral arterioles.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a tension-type headache. Tension-type headaches are the most common type of recurring headache and are characterized by a bilateral, nonpulsatile, band-like pain. The pain is usually mild to moderate in intensity and can last for several hours. The absence of nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia, as well as the lack of aggravation by movements, suggests that this is not a migraine headache.

In this case, the patient's headache is worsened by coughing or laughing, which suggests an increase in intracranial pressure. The headache is also worse in the morning, which may be due to the dilation of intracerebral arterioles that occurs after the patient has breakfast and taken her medications. The patient's history of stable angina pectoris and the use of isosorbide mononitrate, a vasodilator, further support the possibility of intracerebral arteriolar dilation as the underlying mechanism for her headaches.

Meningeal irritation by blood products originating from a chronic subdural hematoma (option A) is unlikely in this case as there are no signs or symptoms of a chronic subdural hematoma, such as focal neurologic deficits or meningeal symptoms.

Dissection of an intracerebral vessel (option B) is also unlikely as there are no focal neurologic deficits or signs of vascular compromise.

Pressure created by the content of the paranasal sinuses (option C) is unlikely as palpation of the paranasal sinuses is painless and there are no other signs or symptoms of sinusitis.

Meningeal irritation by a growing intracranial neoplasm (option D) is unlikely as there are no focal neurologic deficits or signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as papilledema.

Therefore, the most likely mechanism underlying the patient's headaches is the dilation of the intracerebral arterioles.",
"A 31-year-old male comes to your office for his annual exam. He states that he received all of his recommended vaccinations prior to beginning college, but has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years. His medical history is significant for intermittent, exercise-induced asthma. He has been sexually active in the past with multiple female partners. In addition to an influenza vaccine, which vaccine should be administered to this patient during this visit?
Options:
(A): Pneumococcal vaccine
(B): Meningococcal vaccine
(C): Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine
(D): Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine
(E): Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine
","Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine",Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine.

Explanation:
Based on the provided information, the patient is a 31-year-old male who has not had any vaccines in the past 13 years. It is important to note that he has a history of intermittent, exercise-induced asthma and has been sexually active in the past with multiple female partners.

The recommended vaccine for this patient during his annual exam, in addition to the influenza vaccine, is the Tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis booster (Tdap) vaccine. The Tdap vaccine is routinely recommended for adults every 10 years to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough). Tetanus is a severe infection that can cause muscle spasms and lockjaw, while diphtheria is a severe bacterial infection that can cause a thick covering in the back of the throat. Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory infection that can be particularly dangerous for infants.

The other options are not indicated based on the patient's age, medical history, and sexual activity. The pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for individuals aged 65 years or older, and the meningococcal vaccine is routinely recommended at age 11 through 12 years and at age 16 years. The Haemophilus influenza B (HIB) vaccine is typically given to children under the age of 5. The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for females aged 19 to 26 and males aged 19 to 21 who have not received it before.

Therefore, the Tdap vaccine is the most appropriate choice for this patient during his annual exam.",
"A 24-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with a 2-week history of a foot ulcer. She says that she punctured her foot with a rusty nail while she was playing tennis and that the puncture wound has since progressed to a non-healing ulcer. Over the last 2 days, she has also been experiencing a fever and drainage from the wound. On presentation, she is found to have a slightly fruity smelling red ulcer with purulent drainage. Probing the ulcer goes all the way down to bone. Which of the following characteristics is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Gram-negative bacilli
(B): Gram-negative diplococci
(C): Gram-positive bacilli
(D): Gram-positive cocci in chains
(E): Gram-positive cocci in clusters
",Gram-negative bacilli,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Gram-negative bacilli.

The patient's symptoms, including a non-healing ulcer, fever, drainage, and a foul-smelling wound, are suggestive of an infection. The fact that probing the ulcer goes all the way down to the bone indicates the presence of osteomyelitis, which is a serious infection of the bone. In this context, the most likely cause of the infection is gram-negative bacilli.

According to Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, the infection surrounding a foot ulcer may be due to multiple organisms. However, aerobic gram-negative bacilli are commonly implicated in these types of infections. Other common organisms include aerobic gram-positive cocci (such as staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], and group A and B streptococci) and obligate anaerobes. 

Therefore, gram-negative bacilli are the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms. It is important to obtain cultures from the wound to identify the specific organisms involved and guide appropriate treatment. Plain radiographs should also be performed to assess the possibility of osteomyelitis in chronic ulcers that have not responded to therapy.",
"A 23-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of anorexia, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and dark-colored urine. He recently returned from a trip to Belize. His temperature is 38.3°C (100.9°F). Physical examination shows scleral icterus and tender hepatomegaly. Serum studies show markedly elevated transaminases and anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies. In this patient, infected cells express more MHC class I molecules on their surfaces. This cellular event is primarily induced by a molecule that is also responsible for which of the following changes?
Options:
(A): Upregulated expression of exogenously synthesized antigens
(B): Enhanced macrophage phagocytic function
(C): Differentiation of T cells into TH1 cells
(D): Activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2
(E): Increased breakdown of intracellular RNA
",Increased breakdown of intracellular RNA,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Increased breakdown of intracellular RNA.

Explanation:
In this patient, the presence of anti-hepatitis A virus antibodies and elevated transaminases suggests that he has acute hepatitis A infection. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a single-stranded RNA virus that primarily infects hepatocytes. During HAV infection, the virus replicates within the hepatocytes and induces the breakdown of intracellular RNA. This leads to the release of viral RNA fragments into the cytoplasm, which are then recognized by the host immune system.

One of the consequences of increased breakdown of intracellular RNA is the upregulation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. MHC class I molecules present intracellular antigens, including viral peptides, to cytotoxic T cells. This presentation of viral antigens by MHC class I molecules is crucial for the immune response against viral infections.

Therefore, the molecule responsible for the increased breakdown of intracellular RNA during HAV infection is also responsible for the upregulation of MHC class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. This allows the immune system to recognize and eliminate the infected hepatocytes.",
"A 42-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressive fatigue and shortness of breath for 1 month. He has been unable to practice with his recreational soccer team and has had to rest frequently when walking to work. His only medication is ibuprofen for joint pain. Physical examination shows tanned skin. There is tenderness to palpation and stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal joints of both hands. Pulmonary examination shows coarse crackles in both lung fields. The liver is palpated 4 cm below the right costal margin. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) testing is most likely to be positive for which of the following?
Options:
(A): HLA-B27
(B): HLA-DR3
(C): HLA-DR4
(D): HLA-B8
(E): HLA-A3
",HLA-A3,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) HLA-DR4.

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation of the patient, the most likely diagnosis is systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder characterized by fibrosis and vascular abnormalities. HLA-DR4 is strongly associated with systemic sclerosis, particularly the limited cutaneous subtype. 

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and inability to participate in physical activities are consistent with the pulmonary involvement seen in systemic sclerosis. The tanned skin and liver palpation findings suggest the presence of increased melanin deposition and hepatomegaly, which can occur in systemic sclerosis.

HLA-B27 is associated with ankylosing spondylitis and other seronegative spondyloarthropathies, but it is not typically associated with systemic sclerosis.

HLA-DR3 is associated with autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus, but it is not specifically associated with systemic sclerosis.

HLA-B8 is associated with Graves disease and myasthenia gravis, but it is not associated with systemic sclerosis.

HLA-A3 is not specifically associated with any autoimmune disease, including systemic sclerosis.",
"A 32-year-old Caucasian woman is referred to a gastroenterologist by her family physician for 8 months of abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia. Her personal history is relevant for allergic rhinitis. Physical examination shows grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her arms, torso, and abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient?
Options:
(A): Amitriptyline
(B): Octreotide
(C): Lactose-free diet
(D): Gluten-free diet
(E): Methysergide maleate
",Gluten-free diet,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Gluten-free diet.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, foul-smelling diarrhea with floating, bulky stools, weight loss, and macrocytic anemia, along with the presence of grouped, erythematous papulovesicular lesions on her arms, torso, and abdomen, the most likely diagnosis is celiac disease.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The ingestion of gluten triggers an immune response in the small intestine, leading to inflammation and damage to the lining of the intestine. This can result in malabsorption of nutrients, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea, weight loss, and anemia.

The most appropriate approach for the management of celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. This involves avoiding all foods and products that contain gluten. By eliminating gluten from the diet, the inflammation in the small intestine can be reduced, allowing for healing and resolution of symptoms.

The other options listed are not appropriate for the management of celiac disease:

- Amitriptyline (option A) is a tricyclic antidepressant and is not indicated for the treatment of celiac disease.
- Octreotide (option B) is a medication used to treat conditions such as acromegaly and certain types of tumors. It is not indicated for the treatment of celiac disease.
- Lactose-free diet (option C) is indicated for individuals with lactose intolerance, which is the inability to digest lactose, a sugar found in milk and dairy products. Celiac disease is not related to lactose intolerance, although some individuals with celiac disease may also have lactose intolerance.
- Methysergide maleate (option E) is a medication used to prevent migraines and is not indicated for the treatment of celiac disease.

Therefore, the most appropriate approach for the management of this patient with celiac disease is a gluten-free diet.",
"A 62-year-old woman with small-cell lung cancer comes to the physician because of a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed 30 minutes after going outside to do garden work. She wore a long-sleeved shirt and was exposed to direct sunlight for about 10 minutes. The patient is light-skinned and has a history of occasional sunburns when she does not apply sunscreen. Current medications include demeclocycline for malignancy-associated hyponatremia and amoxicillin for sinusitis. Physical examination shows prominent erythema and a papular eruption on her forehead, cheeks, neck, and the dorsum of both hands. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Degranulation of presensitized mast cells
(B): Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies
(C): Lymphocyte-mediated allergic reaction
(D): Accumulation of porphobilinogen
(E): Cell injury due to drug metabolites
",Cell injury due to drug metabolites,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Cell injury due to drug metabolites.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including a painful, burning red rash on her face and hands that developed after sun exposure, are consistent with a condition known as photosensitivity. Photosensitivity is an abnormal reaction of the skin to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet (UV) light. It can be caused by various factors, including certain medications.

In this case, the patient is taking demeclocycline and amoxicillin. Demeclocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that can cause photosensitivity reactions. When exposed to sunlight, demeclocycline can undergo a photochemical reaction, leading to the formation of reactive drug metabolites. These metabolites can cause damage to the skin cells, resulting in the painful, burning rash.

Amoxicillin, on the other hand, is not typically associated with photosensitivity reactions. Therefore, option (B) Formation of drug-induced autoantibodies, which suggests an immune-mediated reaction, is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option (A) Degranulation of presensitized mast cells and option (C) Lymphocyte-mediated allergic reaction are also less likely because they are more commonly associated with allergic reactions, which typically present with different symptoms such as itching, hives, and swelling.

Option (D) Accumulation of porphobilinogen is not relevant to this case as it is associated with a condition called acute intermittent porphyria, which does not present with the specific symptoms described by the patient.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms is cell injury due to drug metabolites, as seen in option (E).",
"A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after he was found outside in the middle of a blizzard. On presentation, he is conscious but does not know where he is nor how he got there. His wife is contacted and says that he has been getting increasingly confused over the past 6 weeks. This progressed from misplacing objects to getting lost in places that he knew how to navigate previously. Most worryingly, he has recently started forgetting the names of their children. In addition to these memory changes, she says that he now has rapid jerky movements of his extremities as well as coordination and balance problems. Finally, he has become extremely paranoid about government surveillance and has had hallucinations about secret agents in their house. His previous medical history is significant for a previous car crash in which the patient required internal fixation of a femur fracture and a corneal transplant for corneal degeneration. Otherwise he had no neurologic deficits prior to 6 weeks ago. Physical exam reveals myoclonus and ataxia. Which of the following is true of the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments
(B): Contains genetic material but is unable to survive independent from a host
(C): Has a cell wall containing peptidoglycan
(D): Associated with longstanding hypertension
(E): Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein
",Can be transmitted on medical equipment even after autoclaving instruments,Incorrect,"The correct choice is (E): Leads to intracellular aggregations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of progressive memory loss, confusion, getting lost, forgetting names, rapid jerky movements, coordination and balance problems, paranoia, and hallucinations, the most likely cause of his symptoms is a neurodegenerative disorder. The presence of myoclonus and ataxia on physical exam further supports this diagnosis.

Among the options provided, option (E) is the most accurate description of the underlying pathology. Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and some forms of frontotemporal dementia, are characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the brain. In Alzheimer's disease, one of the key proteins involved is hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which forms intracellular aggregations called neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles disrupt the normal functioning of neurons and contribute to the cognitive and motor symptoms seen in the patient.

Options (A), (B), and (C) are not applicable to this case. Option (A) refers to the transmission of infectious agents on medical equipment, which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Option (B) describes viruses, which are unable to survive independently and require a host for replication. Option (C) refers to bacteria with a cell wall containing peptidoglycan, which is not relevant to this case.

Option (D) is also not applicable to this case. While longstanding hypertension can lead to vascular dementia, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. Vascular dementia typically presents with a stepwise decline in cognitive function, often associated with a history of cerebrovascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors. The patient's symptoms, such as memory loss, confusion, and hallucinations, are more consistent with a neurodegenerative disorder rather than vascular dementia.",
"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician due to sore throat and fever. He was in his usual state of health until 3 days ago when he began to complain of a sore throat as well as general malaise. The patient's past medical history reveals recurrent upper respiratory infections but no skin or soft tissue infections. The child had cardiac surgery as an infant but has otherwise been healthy. On presentation, his temperature is 100°F (37.8 °C), blood pressure is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 65/min, and respirations are 22/min. Physical exam shows white plaques on the tongue and mouth. A scraping of this material reveals a characteristic morphology after being treated with KOH. Serum protein electrophoresis shows a normal distribution of bands from this patient. Which of the following findings would most likely be found in this patient?
Options:
(A): Abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE)
(B): Delayed separation of the umbilical cord
(C): Hypoparathyroidism
(D): Partial albinism
(E): Thrombocytopenic purpura
",Hypoparathyroidism,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Hypoparathyroidism.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with a sore throat, fever, and white plaques on the tongue and mouth. These findings are consistent with oral thrush, which is caused by an overgrowth of the fungus Candida albicans. The characteristic morphology seen after treating a scraping of the material with KOH confirms the diagnosis of oral thrush.

Hypoparathyroidism is the most likely finding in this patient because it is commonly associated with recurrent fungal infections, including oral thrush. The parathyroid glands are responsible for regulating calcium and phosphate levels in the body. Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by decreased production or secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which leads to low levels of calcium and high levels of phosphate in the blood. This imbalance in calcium and phosphate levels can impair the immune system's ability to fight off infections, making individuals with hypoparathyroidism more susceptible to fungal infections.

The other options are not likely to be found in this patient based on the given information:
(A) Abnormal expression of autoimmune regulator (AIRE) is associated with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1, which can cause a variety of autoimmune disorders but is not specifically associated with recurrent fungal infections.
(B) Delayed separation of the umbilical cord is a characteristic finding in patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency, which is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the immune system. However, this condition is not associated with oral thrush or recurrent upper respiratory infections.
(D) Partial albinism is a condition characterized by a reduction in pigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. It is not associated with recurrent fungal infections or oral thrush.
(E) Thrombocytopenic purpura is a condition characterized by low platelet counts and abnormal bleeding. It is not associated with recurrent fungal infections or oral thrush.",
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for sleeping problems and the inability to concentrate for 3 months. She says she is worried because she and her husband have been trying to conceive for more than a year with no success. Conception by in vitro fertilization was attempted once 3 months ago but was unsuccessful. Analysis of her husband's semen has shown normal sperm counts and morphology. She has a 6-year-old daughter who was born at term after an uncomplicated pregnancy. She has no history of severe illness and tries to stay healthy by going to the gym an hour per day. Her menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days; her last menstrual period started 2 days ago. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's inability to conceive?
Options:
(A): Pelvic inflammatory disease
(B): Asherman's syndrome
(C): Diminished ovarian reserve
(D): Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(E): Premature ovarian failure
",Diminished ovarian reserve,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Diminished ovarian reserve.

Explanation:
Diminished ovarian reserve refers to a decrease in the quantity and quality of a woman's eggs. This can lead to difficulty in conceiving and is a common cause of infertility in women over the age of 35. In this case, the patient is 35 years old and has been trying to conceive for more than a year without success. Additionally, she has a 6-year-old daughter, indicating that she was able to conceive in the past. The unsuccessful attempt at in vitro fertilization further supports the diagnosis of diminished ovarian reserve. Other causes of infertility, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, Asherman's syndrome, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and premature ovarian failure, are less likely based on the information provided.",
"A 25-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by her family. They found her somnolent next to her computer and scattered pill bottles over two hours ago. The family cannot recall the types of pill bottles that they found and did not bring them to the ED. The patient's past medical history is notable for anxiety, obesity, hypertension, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. She is currently not on any medications other than an exercise program with which she is non-compliant. A physical exam is performed and is within normal limits. The patient begins communicating with the physician and states that she did take acetaminophen but it was only a few pills. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 82/min, blood pressure is 125/85 mmHg, respirations are 11/min, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): N-acetylcysteine
(B): Blood acetaminophen levels
(C): Charcoal
(D): IV fluids
(E): Syrup of ipecac
",N-acetylcysteine,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) N-acetylcysteine.

The patient's history and presentation are concerning for a possible acetaminophen overdose. Acetaminophen overdose can cause hepatotoxicity, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. N-acetylcysteine is the antidote for acetaminophen overdose and should be administered as soon as possible to prevent liver damage.

Blood acetaminophen levels (option B) can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of acetaminophen overdose, but the patient's history and presentation are already highly suggestive of an overdose. Therefore, the next best step is to initiate treatment with N-acetylcysteine rather than waiting for the results of blood acetaminophen levels.

Charcoal (option C) is used to absorb ingested toxins in cases of acute poisoning. However, in this case, the patient's ingestion occurred over two hours ago, and charcoal is most effective when administered within one hour of ingestion. Therefore, charcoal is not the next best step in management.

IV fluids (option D) may be necessary to maintain hydration and support blood pressure in cases of overdose, but it is not the next best step in management. The priority in this case is to administer N-acetylcysteine to prevent liver damage.

Syrup of ipecac (option E) is no longer recommended for the management of acute poisoning. It can cause vomiting, which may be harmful in cases of certain ingestions, such as caustic substances or hydrocarbons. Therefore, syrup of ipecac is not the next best step in management.",
"A 27-year-old man and his wife come to the physician for preconception genetic counseling. The patient and his wife are asymptomatic and have no history of serious illness. The patient's older brother died at age 13 from heart failure and his 6-year-old nephew currently has severe muscle weakness. Genetic testing in the patient's family shows that his mother is not a carrier of the mutation that is responsible for the disease in his relatives. A pedigree chart of the patient's family is shown. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected?
Options:
(A): Variable expressivity
(B): Maternal uniparental disomy
(C): Gonadal mosaicism
(D): Dominant negative mutation
(E): Incomplete penetrance
",Gonadal mosaicism,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Gonadal mosaicism.

Explanation:
Gonadal mosaicism is the most likely explanation for the patient not being affected. Gonadal mosaicism refers to the presence of a genetic mutation in some of the germ cells (sperm or eggs) of an individual, while the rest of their body cells do not carry the mutation. In this case, the patient's mother is not a carrier of the mutation, indicating that the mutation likely arose in the patient's father's germ cells. This would explain why the patient's older brother and nephew are affected, as they inherited the mutation from their father, but the patient himself did not inherit the mutation. Gonadal mosaicism can lead to situations where unaffected parents have affected children, as seen in this case.",
"A 58-year-old Caucasian female presents to her primary care physician with concerns about several recent health changes. The patient has recently gained weight and can't seem to exercise like she used to. She also notes that her thinking seems slow. Physical examination shows thickened, dry skin. Serum analysis confirms the physician's suspicions. Which of the following findings was most helpful in the diagnosis?
Options:
(A): High T4 and T3
(B): Low T4 and T3
(C): High TSH
(D): Hypercholesterolemia
(E): Low TSH
",High TSH,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) High TSH.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of weight gain, decreased exercise tolerance, slow thinking, and physical examination findings of thickened, dry skin are consistent with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder.

In hypothyroidism, the feedback loop between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland is disrupted. The hypothalamus releases thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). TSH then acts on the thyroid gland to produce and release thyroid hormones T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine).

In this case, the most helpful finding in the diagnosis is a high TSH level. When the thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormones, the pituitary gland senses this and increases the production of TSH to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more hormones. Therefore, a high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not functioning properly and is not producing enough thyroid hormones.

Option (A) High T4 and T3 would be seen in hyperthyroidism, where the thyroid gland is overactive and producing excessive amounts of thyroid hormones. This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option (B) Low T4 and T3 would also be seen in hypothyroidism, but it does not provide information about the functioning of the feedback loop between the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and thyroid gland.

Option (D) Hypercholesterolemia is a common finding in hypothyroidism, but it is not specific to the diagnosis and can be seen in other conditions as well.

Option (E) Low TSH would be seen in hyperthyroidism, where the thyroid gland is overactive and producing excessive amounts of thyroid hormones. This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.",
"A 33-year-old woman at 17-weeks gestation comes to the physician for evaluation of a painless mass in the right breast for the last 3 weeks that has not increased in size. Physical examination shows dense breasts and a 2.5-cm rubbery, mobile mass that is nontender in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. A biopsy of the mass shows rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Fibroadenoma
(B): Normal pregnancy-related changes
(C): Fibrocystic changes of the breast
(D): Fat necrosis
(E): Phyllodes tumor
",Fibroadenoma,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Fibroadenoma.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are common benign breast tumors that occur most commonly in women of reproductive age. They typically present as painless, rubbery, mobile masses that are well-demarcated and nontender. Fibroadenomas can occur in any quadrant of the breast, but are most commonly found in the upper outer quadrant, which is consistent with the location described in the case. The average size of a fibroadenoma is 2-3 cm, and they may decrease in size over time. The biopsy findings of rounded contour with overgrowth of fibrous and glandular tissue are also consistent with fibroadenoma. Fibroadenomas are not associated with pregnancy-related changes, fibrocystic changes, fat necrosis, or phyllodes tumors.",
"A 27-year-old male presents for emergency surgery to reattach his left arm, severed during a high-speed car accident, and has lost significant amounts of blood. His wife arrives within minutes to the hospital exclaiming that under no circumstance should he receive any blood transfusions during surgery. After reviewing his medical chart, you see also see an annotation indicating no blood transfusions for religious reasons. Knowing that he needs a blood transfusion to save his life, what do you do?
Options:
(A): Administer a blood transfusion to save the patient's life
(B): Call the ethics board of the hospital to discuss the issue
(C): Respect the patient's written instructions and do not adminster a blood transfusion
(D): Convince the wife to administer a blood transfusion to her husband
(E): Refuse to treat the patient as he will die without a blood transfusion
",Respect the patient's written instructions and do not adminster a blood transfusion,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Respect the patient's written instructions and do not administer a blood transfusion.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has explicitly stated in his medical chart that he does not want to receive blood transfusions for religious reasons. As a medical professional, it is important to respect the patient's autonomy and religious beliefs. Even though a blood transfusion is necessary to save his life, it is not ethically appropriate to administer the transfusion against his wishes.

It is important to note that this decision may be difficult and emotionally challenging, as the patient's life is at risk. However, it is crucial to uphold the principles of patient autonomy and informed consent. If the patient is unable to make decisions due to his medical condition, it is important to consult the hospital's ethics committee and legal department to ensure that the patient's wishes are respected while also providing appropriate medical care.",
"The parents of a 14-year-old patient are concerned and have questions about the use of insulin for their son’s recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes. The patient has developed an upper respiratory infection while at school. He is coughing and has a runny nose. His temperature is 37.8° C (100.2° F) and vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following modifications to his insulin regimen would you recommend to this patient and his parents?
Options:
(A): Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.
(B): Reduce the insulin dose.
(C): Continue same regimen.
(D): Hold insulin until the patient gets better.
(E): Increase the insulin dose to double.
",Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Increase the frequency of blood glucose checks.

Explanation:
When a patient with type 1 diabetes develops an illness, such as an upper respiratory infection, it can lead to changes in their insulin requirements. Illness can cause insulin resistance, resulting in higher blood glucose levels. Therefore, it is important to increase the frequency of blood glucose checks to closely monitor the patient's blood sugar levels and make any necessary adjustments to their insulin regimen.

Reducing the insulin dose (B) or holding insulin until the patient gets better (D) is not recommended because it can lead to hyperglycemia and poor glycemic control. Continuing the same regimen (C) without increasing the frequency of blood glucose checks may result in missed opportunities to detect and manage hyperglycemia. Increasing the insulin dose to double (E) without monitoring blood glucose levels can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

Therefore, the best course of action is to increase the frequency of blood glucose checks to ensure appropriate insulin adjustments can be made based on the patient's blood sugar levels.",
"A researcher evaluates healthy breast tissue from 100 women, 50 women that were pregnant at the time of the study and 50 age-matched non-pregnant women. The breast tissue in pregnant women contained an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to the non-pregnant women. Which process caused this change?
Options:
(A): Hyperplasia
(B): Hypertrophy
(C): Atrophy
(D): Metaplasia
(E): Dysplasia
",Hyperplasia,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Hyperplasia.

Explanation:
Hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells in an organ or tissue in response to a stimulus. In this case, the breast tissue in pregnant women showed an increased number of acinar glands with epithelial proliferation compared to non-pregnant women. This increase in the number of acinar glands is indicative of hyperplasia. During pregnancy, the breast undergoes hormonal changes that stimulate the growth and branching of the ductal system, leading to an increase in the number of acinar glands. This is a normal physiological response to prepare the breast for lactation.",
"A 21-month-old boy is brought to the physician for a well-child examination. His mother noticed deformities in both of his legs since he started walking independently. He has been healthy apart from an upper respiratory tract infection 6 months ago. He was delivered at 38 weeks' gestation. His 6-year-old sister was treated for developmental dysplasia of the hip. He can kick a ball and say a 2-word phrase. He plays well with other children at his day care. His immunizations are up-to-date. He is at the 40th percentile for height and 50th percentile for weight. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows closed anterior and posterior fontanelles. The knees do not stay together when both the feet and ankles are placed together. The gait is unremarkable. The mother is concerned that he has a growth disorder. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Vitamin D supplementation
(B): Reassurance and follow-up
(C): X-ray of the lower extremities
(D): Bracing of the lower extremities
(E): Tibial osteotomy
",Reassurance and follow-up,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Reassurance and follow-up.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the child's growth parameters (height and weight) are within normal limits, and he is meeting developmental milestones such as kicking a ball and saying a 2-word phrase. Additionally, his gait is unremarkable. These findings suggest that the child's growth and development are appropriate for his age.

The deformities in both legs that the mother noticed could be due to physiological bowing of the legs, which is a normal variant in young children. Physiological bowing typically resolves on its own as the child grows and the bones straighten out. It is important to reassure the mother that this is a common finding and does not indicate a growth disorder.

Given the absence of any concerning findings on examination and the child's normal growth and development, the most appropriate next step in management is reassurance and follow-up. The physician should explain to the mother that physiological bowing is a normal part of a child's growth and that it typically resolves on its own. The physician should also schedule a follow-up visit to monitor the child's growth and development and address any further concerns the mother may have. No further interventions, such as vitamin D supplementation, X-ray of the lower extremities, bracing, or tibial osteotomy, are necessary at this time.",
"A 30-year-old woman presents to an outpatient clinic for a scheduled gynecologic check-up. The patient appears well and has no specific complaints. She is current with her Pap smears, all of which have been normal. Her menstrual periods are regular and usually last 3–4 days. She denies any recent travel or a history of trauma. The patient has not been sexually active for the past 2 months. She smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally, but has never used illicit drugs. The pelvic examination reveals a small, firm, non-tender, immobile cystic mass at the edge of the exocervical os with a yellow hue. The patient is otherwise asymptomatic and has no other complaints. The remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the next best step in management?
Options:
(A): No further intervention
(B): Electrocautery and cryofreezing
(C): Colposcopy and biopsy
(D): Administration of oral contraceptives
(E): Administration of antibiotics
",No further intervention,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) No further intervention.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a nabothian cyst. Nabothian cysts are benign cystic lesions that occur when the columnar epithelium of the endocervix grows over the squamous epithelium of the exocervix, obstructing the cervical glands. These cysts are typically small, firm, non-tender, and immobile. They often have a yellow hue due to the accumulation of mucus within the cyst.

Nabothian cysts are common and usually do not require any treatment or intervention. They are typically incidental findings and are not associated with any symptoms or complications. As such, no further intervention is necessary in this case.

Electrocautery and cryofreezing (B) are not indicated for nabothian cysts because they are benign and do not require treatment.

Colposcopy and biopsy (C) are not necessary in this case because the patient has a typical presentation of a nabothian cyst and there are no concerning features to suggest cervical dysplasia or malignancy.

Administration of oral contraceptives (D) is not indicated for nabothian cysts because they are benign and do not require treatment. Oral contraceptives are used for contraception and to regulate menstrual cycles, but they do not have any effect on nabothian cysts.

Administration of antibiotics (E) is not indicated for nabothian cysts because they are not caused by infection. Nabothian cysts are a result of the normal growth of cervical epithelium and do not require antibiotic treatment.",
"A 1900-g (4-lb 3-oz) newborn is delivered at term to a 36-year-old primigravid woman. Pregnancy was complicated by polyhydramnios. Apgar scores are 7 and 7 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. He is at the 2nd percentile for head circumference and 15th percentile for length. Examination shows a prominent posterior part of the head. The ears are low-set and the jaw is small and retracted. The fists are clenched, with overlapping second and third fingers. The calcaneal bones are prominent and the plantar surface of the foot shows a convex deformity. Abdominal examination shows an omphalocele. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Cataracts
(B): Ventricular septal defect
(C): Ebstein's anomaly
(D): Pheochromocytoma
(E): Holoprosencephaly
",Ventricular septal defect,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Ventricular septal defect.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation described in the question stem is consistent with the diagnosis of Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome. Trisomy 18 is a chromosomal disorder characterized by multiple congenital anomalies and is associated with high mortality. 

The characteristic features of Trisomy 18 include low birth weight, small head circumference, low-set ears, small and retracted jaw (micrognathia), clenched fists with overlapping second and third fingers, prominent calcaneal bones, and a convex deformity of the plantar surface of the foot (rocker-bottom feet). 

In addition to these physical findings, Trisomy 18 is also associated with various congenital heart defects, including ventricular septal defect (VSD). Therefore, further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show a ventricular septal defect. 

It is important to note that while Trisomy 18 is associated with multiple congenital anomalies, the specific findings mentioned in the question stem are highly suggestive of this condition. Other findings that may be seen in Trisomy 18 include omphalocele (as mentioned in the question stem), cleft lip/palate, renal abnormalities, and developmental delay.",
"A 51-year-old man presents to his primary care provider complaining of fatigue, weight loss, and intermittent fevers for the past 6 months. He has had sexual intercourse with multiple men and women over the past year and does not use barrier protection. His last screen for sexually transmitted diseases was 10 years ago and was normal. His past medical history is notable for well-controlled asthma. He was involved in a motorcycle accident 2 years ago and suffered multiple fractured bones in his upper and lower extremities, all of which have healed. He has a distant history of cocaine abuse. He drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per week. His temperature is 100.8°F (38.2°C), blood pressure is 130/75 mmHg, pulse is 85/min, and respirations are 20/min. On examination, he appears cachectic but is pleasant and appropriately interactive. An HIV differentiation assay and follow-up Western blot are performed and are positive. The patient is started on tenofovir, abacavir, and efavirenz. However, the patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, so the decision is made to replace this medication with ritonavir. Which of the following adverse effects is this patient at greatest risk for as a result of this change in medication regimen?
Options:
(A): Hepatotoxicity
(B): Lipodystrophy
(C): Megaloblastic anemia
(D): Myelosuppression
(E): Peripheral neuropathy
",Lipodystrophy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Lipodystrophy.

Lipodystrophy is a well-known adverse effect of antiretroviral therapy, particularly with the use of protease inhibitors and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) like abacavir. It is characterized by changes in body fat distribution, including loss of subcutaneous fat in the face, limbs, and buttocks (lipoatrophy) and accumulation of fat in the abdomen, back of the neck (buffalo hump), and breasts (lipohypertrophy). These changes can have significant cosmetic and psychological effects on patients.

In this case, the patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, which necessitated a change in medication regimen. Ritonavir, a protease inhibitor, was chosen as the replacement. Protease inhibitors, including ritonavir, have been associated with an increased risk of lipodystrophy. Therefore, this patient is at greatest risk for developing lipodystrophy as a result of the change in medication regimen.

It is important to note that lipodystrophy is a complex condition with multiple contributing factors, including the specific antiretroviral drugs used, duration of therapy, and individual patient characteristics. Regular monitoring and management of lipodystrophy are essential in patients receiving antiretroviral therapy.",
"A 68-year-old man presents to his primary care physician with complaints of increased fatigue and back pain for the past year. His symptoms are progressively getting worse over the past few months despite adequate rest and trial of over the counter analgesics. His back pain is constant and non-radiating in nature. He denies any trauma to his back. His past medical history is insignificant. On examination, there is mild tenderness over the lumbar region in the midline with an absence of paraspinal muscle tenderness. Straight leg raise test is negative. His skin and conjunctiva appear pale. The physician orders basic blood work. His results are provided below.

Urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells. The patient’s proteinuria best fits in which of the following category?
Options:
(A): Overflow proteinuria
(B): Transient (functional) proteinuria
(C): Tubular proteinuria
(D): Orthostatic proteinuria
(E): Isolated proteinuria
",Overflow proteinuria,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Overflow proteinuria.

Explanation:
Overflow proteinuria occurs when there is an excessive amount of low molecular weight proteins in the urine that overwhelms the reabsorptive capacity of the renal tubules. This can occur in conditions where there is an excess production of abnormal proteins or when there is impaired tubular reabsorption. In this case, the patient's urinalysis shows proteinuria without any RBCs or pus cells, indicating that the proteinuria is not due to inflammation or infection. Additionally, the patient's blood work shows an elevated calcium level, which can be seen in conditions such as multiple myeloma or other plasma cell dyscrasias, where there is an excess production of abnormal proteins. Therefore, the patient's proteinuria best fits in the category of overflow proteinuria.",
"A 68-year-old postmenopausal woman presents to the clinic for a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The patient states that she has mild joint pain, which she attributes to osteoarthritis, but she notes no recent fractures. She says that her mother had osteoporosis and she is concerned that she may develop it as well. She takes calcium and vitamin D supplements daily. After review of her DEXA scan, her physician states that she has osteopenia. Which of the following is this patient’s most likely DEXA scan result?
Options:
(A): T-score of 1.2
(B): T-score of -0.8
(C): Z-score of -2.0
(D): T-score of -1.6
(E): T-score of -2.7
",T-score of -1.6,Correct,"The correct choice is (D): T-score of -1.6

Explanation:
According to the provided information, the patient has been diagnosed with osteopenia based on her DEXA scan results. Osteopenia is defined as a T-score between -1.0 and -2.4. The T-score compares the patient's bone density to the density of a healthy young adult of the same sex and race/ethnicity. A T-score of -1.6 falls within the range of osteopenia, indicating that the patient has lower bone density than a healthy young adult but not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. Therefore, the most likely DEXA scan result for this patient is a T-score of -1.6.",
"An investigator is studying the growth pattern of a particular bacterial strain that caused a respiratory disease outbreak in children in rural Venezuela. The bacteria are found to be able to grow in a specialized culture that contains sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite; the colonies are black and have a shining surface. The isolated bacteria are most likely which of the following?
Options:
(A): Legionella pneumophila
(B): Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(C): Haemophilus influenzae
(D): Bordetella pertussis
(E): Corynebacterium diphtheriae
",Corynebacterium diphtheriae,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Corynebacterium diphtheriae.

Explanation:
The growth pattern and characteristics described in the question are consistent with Corynebacterium diphtheriae. This bacterium is known to cause respiratory disease, specifically diphtheria, and can grow in a specialized culture that contains sheep blood, cystine, and potassium tellurite. The colonies of Corynebacterium diphtheriae are typically black and have a shining surface. Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bordetella pertussis do not exhibit these specific growth characteristics.",
"A 7-month-old boy is brought to the physician because of a 2-month history of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding. He was delivered at term to a 32-year-old woman. He is not able to sit upright on his own. He is at the 75th percentile for height and 25th percentile for weight. His temperature is 37.7°C (99.8°F), blood pressure is 110/68 mm Hg, pulse is 150/min, and respirations are 50/min. His tongue protrudes beyond the teeth. Neck veins are distended. Crackles are heard at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows an S3 gallop. The liver is palpated 2 cm below the right costal margin. Neurologic examination shows profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. He has 2+ reflexes bilaterally. A chest x-ray shows cardiomegaly. Serum glucose is 105 mg/dL. Which of the following is the enzyme most likely to be defective in this patient?
Options:
(A): Muscle glycogen phosphorylase
(B): Very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
(C): Lysosomal acid maltase
(D): Glucose-6-phosphatase
(E): Glycogen debranching enzyme
",Lysosomal acid maltase,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Lysosomal acid maltase.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Pompe disease, which is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme lysosomal acid maltase (also known as acid alpha-glucosidase). Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, including the heart, liver, and skeletal muscles.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weakness, and difficulty feeding are consistent with the muscle involvement seen in Pompe disease. The inability to sit upright on his own and the profound weakness in proximal and distal muscles of the upper and lower extremities further support this diagnosis.

The physical examination findings of cardiomegaly, S3 gallop, and crackles at both lung bases are indicative of cardiac involvement in Pompe disease. The liver palpation finding of hepatomegaly is also consistent with glycogen accumulation in the liver.

The laboratory finding of normal serum glucose (105 mg/dL) is important because it helps differentiate Pompe disease from other glycogen storage diseases, such as von Gierke disease (caused by a deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase) or McArdle disease (caused by a deficiency of muscle glycogen phosphorylase). In these other glycogen storage diseases, hypoglycemia would be expected.

Therefore, the most likely enzyme to be defective in this patient is lysosomal acid maltase (choice C).",
"A 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is admitted to the hospital to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Two weeks after the conditioning regimen is started, he develops a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 8 g/dL
Leukocyte count 1400/mm3
Segmented neutrophils 20%
Eosinophils 0.5%
Lymphocytes 87%
Monocytes 1%
Platelet count 110,000/mm3
Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?""
Options:
(A): Alkylating chemotherapeutic agent
(B): Transforming growth factor-β
(C): Erythropoietin
(D): Interleukin-5
(E): Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
",Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario is a 4-year-old boy with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who is undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Two weeks after the conditioning regimen is started, he develops a fever and has laboratory findings consistent with myelosuppression, including a low leukocyte count, low hemoglobin, and low platelet count.

Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a pharmacotherapy that stimulates the production and maturation of granulocytes and macrophages. It can be used to treat myelosuppression, which is a common complication of bone marrow transplantation. By stimulating the production of granulocytes, GM-CSF can help to increase the patient's neutrophil count and improve their ability to fight off infections.

Alkylating chemotherapeutic agents (option A) are not appropriate in this case because they are used to treat cancer by damaging the DNA of cancer cells, and the patient is already undergoing chemotherapy as part of their bone marrow transplantation.

Transforming growth factor-β (option B) is not appropriate in this case because it is a cytokine that has immunosuppressive effects and would not be helpful in treating myelosuppression.

Erythropoietin (option C) is a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells and would not be effective in treating myelosuppression or improving the patient's neutrophil count.

Interleukin-5 (option D) is a cytokine that stimulates the production and activation of eosinophils and would not be effective in treating myelosuppression or improving the patient's neutrophil count.

Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to stimulate the production and maturation of granulocytes and improve their neutrophil count.",
"A 27-year-old female is brought to the emergency department by police when she attacked her date outside of a pizza restaurant. The patient refused to explain her behavior to the police. She seemed to be responding to internal stimuli when being initially interviewed. The patient has a past medical history of depression, anxiety, and obesity. The patient has a known history of medication non-compliance. Her temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), pulse is 112/min, blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg, respirations are 18/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. On physical exam the patient is poorly kempt and has an odd body odor. Inspection of her oropharynx reveals multiple ulcers. Cardiac exam is unrevealing with the exception of a friction rub. Since the incident, the patient has calmed down and is currently resting. She is no longer responding to internal stimuli and is more cooperative. Lab values are obtained and are below.

Serum:
Na+: 135 mEq/L
Cl-: 100 mEq/L
K+: 3.9 mEq/L
HCO3-: 24 mEq/L
BUN: 20 mg/dL
Glucose: 70 mg/dL
Creatinine: 1.7 mg/dL
Ca2+: 10.0 mg/dL
Mg2+: 1.5 mEq/L

Hemoglobin: 10 g/dL
Hematocrit: 35%
Reticulocyte count: 4.9%
Platelet count: 275,000/mm^3
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm^3

Which of the following is the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition?
Options:
(A): IM haloperidol
(B): Haloperidol depot
(C): Clozapine
(D): Urine toxicology
(E): ANA and anti-dsDNA levels
",ANA and anti-dsDNA levels,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): ANA and anti-dsDNA levels.

This patient presents with several concerning symptoms and findings that suggest an underlying autoimmune condition. The presence of multiple ulcers in the oropharynx, odd body odor, and a friction rub on cardiac exam are all suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and central nervous system.

The patient's history of depression, anxiety, and obesity, as well as her non-compliance with medication, may be contributing factors to her current presentation. However, the combination of her psychiatric symptoms, physical exam findings, and laboratory abnormalities (such as the low hemoglobin and hematocrit, as well as the elevated creatinine) raise concern for an underlying autoimmune process.

ANA (antinuclear antibody) and anti-dsDNA (anti-double stranded DNA) levels are important tests in the evaluation of SLE. ANA is a sensitive but nonspecific test that can help identify patients who may have an autoimmune condition. Anti-dsDNA antibodies, on the other hand, are more specific for SLE and are associated with disease activity. Therefore, obtaining these tests would be the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition.

Options (A) and (B) involve the use of haloperidol, an antipsychotic medication, which may be appropriate for managing the patient's acute agitation and psychosis. However, these options do not address the underlying cause of her symptoms.

Option (C) involves the use of clozapine, another antipsychotic medication. While clozapine may be effective in managing psychosis, it is not the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition.

Option (D) involves obtaining a urine toxicology screen, which may be useful in ruling out substance-induced psychosis. However, given the patient's history, physical exam findings, and laboratory abnormalities, an autoimmune condition such as SLE is more likely and should be further evaluated.

Therefore, the next best step in management for this patient's underlying condition is to obtain ANA and anti-dsDNA levels to evaluate for SLE.",
"A 68-year-old man presents to the emergency department because of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen. His appendix was removed for an abscess 3 days ago. The complete blood count showed leukocytosis. Anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showed a gram-negative pathogen. Which of the following, in addition to polymicrobial infection, is the most likely cause of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Bacteroides fragilis
(B): Campylobacter jejuni
(C): Clostridium perfringens
(D): Salmonella serotype typhi
(E): Shigella sonnei
",Bacteroides fragilis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Bacteroides fragilis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of fever, abdominal pain, and rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen, along with leukocytosis, suggests an intra-abdominal infection. The fact that the patient had his appendix removed for an abscess 3 days ago indicates a recent surgical procedure, which can increase the risk of infection. The anaerobic culture of the peritoneal fluid needle aspirate showing a gram-negative pathogen further supports the diagnosis of a polymicrobial infection.

Bacteroides fragilis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract. It is a known pathogen in intra-abdominal infections, especially in the setting of recent surgery. Bacteroides fragilis is often part of a polymicrobial infection, along with other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.

Campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative bacterium that is a common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, but it is not typically associated with intra-abdominal infections.

Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that can cause gas gangrene and food poisoning, but it is not commonly associated with intra-abdominal infections.

Salmonella serotype typhi is a gram-negative bacterium that causes typhoid fever, which typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and abdominal pain, but it is not commonly associated with rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen.

Shigella sonnei is a gram-negative bacterium that causes bacillary dysentery, which is characterized by bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, but it is not commonly associated with rapidly progressive distension of the abdomen.",
"A 31-year-old female patient presents with significant swelling and redness of her fingers that is causing her significant pain. Her right knee has also been stiff and slightly swollen for the past 6 weeks. She is overall fatigued and has difficulty moving around but has not sought medical attention until now. On physical examination, the distal interphalangeal joints are swollen, warm, and painful; her nails are pitted and cracked. There are also rough, erythematous skin patches seen over her elbows which have been present for the last few months. She reports that herer father has a similar condition. They both use hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids with moderate benefit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Gout
(B): Reactive arthritis
(C): Psoriatic arthritis
(D): Enteropathic arthropathies
(E): Dermatomyositis
",Psoriatic arthritis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Psoriatic arthritis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that occurs in patients with psoriasis. It typically presents with joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, often affecting the distal interphalangeal joints (as seen in this patient). The presence of pitted and cracked nails (onychodystrophy) is also a characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis. Additionally, the rough, erythematous skin patches over the elbows (psoriasis plaques) further support the diagnosis. The family history of a similar condition in the patient's father is also suggestive of psoriatic arthritis, as it has a genetic component. The use of hydrating creams and topical glucocorticoids with moderate benefit is consistent with the management of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Gout typically presents with sudden onset of severe joint pain, most commonly affecting the first metatarsophalangeal joint (podagra). Reactive arthritis is usually preceded by an infection, such as a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. Enteropathic arthropathies are associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Dermatomyositis is characterized by muscle weakness and skin rash, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.",
"A 44-year-old woman presents to her primary care physician because she has been having fever, chest pain, and cough for the last several weeks. She presented to the physician because she discovered blood in her sputum after coughing. She recently returned from a year of traveling abroad, but has otherwise been healthy. Based on clinical suspicion, an acid fast stain is performed showing the causative organism, and she is started on appropriate therapy. Two weeks later, she returns with a skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion, and is given a factor to take in addition to the medications previously prescribed. Which of the following is a characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided?
Options:
(A): Required for collagen hydroxylation
(B): Required for dehydrogenase enzymes
(C): Required for methionine processing
(D): Required for methylmalonyl-CoA processing
(E): Required for transketolase function
",Required for dehydrogenase enzymes,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Required for dehydrogenase enzymes.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of skin rash, diarrhea, and confusion suggest a drug reaction, specifically a drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS) or drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. This is a severe and potentially life-threatening reaction that can occur as a result of certain medications. 

One of the most common medications associated with DIHS/DRESS syndrome is antituberculosis drugs, which are commonly used to treat tuberculosis. The fact that the patient presented with fever, chest pain, cough, and blood in sputum suggests that she was started on antituberculosis therapy based on the acid-fast stain showing the causative organism.

The factor that was most likely provided to the patient in addition to the antituberculosis medications is pyridoxine (vitamin B6). Pyridoxine is required for dehydrogenase enzymes, which are involved in various metabolic pathways in the body. It is often given as a supplement to patients taking isoniazid, one of the antituberculosis drugs, to prevent or treat peripheral neuropathy, which is a potential side effect of isoniazid.

Therefore, the characteristic of the factor that was most likely provided to the patient is that it is required for dehydrogenase enzymes.",
"A 51-year-old Asian woman presents to her primary care provider with abdominal pain. On examination, she is found to have rebound tenderness in the lower right quadrant of her abdomen. Further workup suggests ovarian cancer, which is confirmed later in the week to be stage 4 with confirmed distant metastases in the lungs and brain. Which of the following routes describes the most likely lymphatic route for this malignancy to have metastasized to the brain?
Options:
(A): Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
(B): Sentinel node - left lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation
(C): Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - right bronchomediastinal trunk - right lymphatic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
(D): Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - right subclavian vein - systemic circulation
(E): Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation
",Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation.

Explanation:
In this case, the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain is through the right lumbar trunk, cisterna chyli, thoracic duct, and left subclavian vein. 

The lymphatic system plays a crucial role in the spread of cancer cells from the primary tumor to distant sites. Lymphatic vessels drain fluid and waste products from tissues and organs, and they also transport immune cells. Cancer cells can enter the lymphatic vessels and travel through the lymphatic system to reach nearby lymph nodes or distant organs.

In ovarian cancer, the sentinel node, which is the first lymph node to receive drainage from the primary tumor, is likely to be in the right lumbar region. From there, the cancer cells can enter the right lumbar trunk, which is a major lymphatic vessel. The right lumbar trunk then drains into the cisterna chyli, a dilated sac-like structure located in the abdomen. 

From the cisterna chyli, the cancer cells can enter the thoracic duct, which is the largest lymphatic vessel in the body. The thoracic duct ascends through the thoracic cavity and eventually drains into the left subclavian vein, where it enters the systemic circulation. 

Once in the systemic circulation, the cancer cells can be carried to distant organs, including the lungs and brain, where they can form metastases.

Therefore, the most likely lymphatic route for ovarian cancer to metastasize to the brain in this case is through the sentinel node - right lumbar trunk - cisterna chyli - thoracic duct - left subclavian vein - systemic circulation pathway.",
"A 49-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-week history of diarrhea and abdominal bloating. His stools are bulky, foul-smelling, and difficult to flush. Over the past 6 months, he has had recurrent dull epigastric pain that is triggered by meals and lasts for a few days. He drinks 6 to 8 beers daily. Abdominal examination shows mild epigastric tenderness with no rebound or guarding. A CT scan of the abdomen is shown. The structure indicated by the arrows is most likely lined by which of the following?
Options:
(A): Simple ductal epithelium
(B): Calcified ductal cells
(C): Granulation tissue
(D): Pyogenic membrane
(E): Columnar mucinous epithelium
",Granulation tissue,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Granulation tissue.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of diarrhea, abdominal bloating, foul-smelling stools, and difficulty flushing, along with the history of recurrent dull epigastric pain triggered by meals, the most likely diagnosis is chronic pancreatitis. 

The CT scan of the abdomen shows a structure indicated by the arrows, which is most likely a pseudocyst. Pseudocysts are a common complication of chronic pancreatitis and are lined by granulation tissue. Granulation tissue is a type of connective tissue that forms during the healing process of an injury or inflammation. In the case of chronic pancreatitis, the inflammation of the pancreas can lead to the formation of pseudocysts, which are fluid-filled sacs lined by granulation tissue.

The other options are not consistent with the findings in this case. Simple ductal epithelium is the normal lining of the pancreatic ducts and would not be present in a pseudocyst. Calcified ductal cells would suggest chronic inflammation and fibrosis, but this is not seen in the CT scan. Pyogenic membrane is associated with abscess formation, which is not seen in this case. Columnar mucinous epithelium is seen in mucinous cystic neoplasms, which are different from pseudocysts.",
"An 80-year-old African American man is brought to the emergency department in a confused state with history of general illness for the past week. He is known to be hypertensive, but noncompliant with medications for the last 20 years. Physical examination reveals dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor. His blood pressure is 180/99 mm Hg, heart rate is 89/min, and respiratory rate is 17/min. The initial laboratory results are remarkable for hemoglobin of 10 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume of 90 μm3, platelet count of 200,000/mm3, blood urea nitrogen of 29 mg/dL, and creatinine of 2.1 mg/dL. Which of the following would be the best initial management for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)
(B): Angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)
(C): Calcium channel blocker (CCB)
(D): Beta-blocker (BB)
(E): Thiazide
",Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI),Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI).

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory results, he is likely experiencing hypertensive emergency, which is characterized by severely elevated blood pressure and end-organ damage. The patient's symptoms of confusion, dry skin, ecchymoses, and conjunctival pallor, along with laboratory findings of anemia (hemoglobin of 10 g/dL) and renal dysfunction (elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), suggest that his hypertension has led to target organ damage, specifically to the kidneys and possibly the brain.

In this scenario, the best initial management for the patient's condition would be an Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). ACEIs are recommended as the initial treatment for hypertensive emergencies, especially in patients with African ancestry and renal dysfunction. ACEIs help to lower blood pressure by inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a potent vasoconstrictor. By blocking the effects of angiotensin II, ACEIs promote vasodilation and decrease blood pressure.

It is important to note that in hypertensive emergencies, the goal is to lower blood pressure gradually over a period of hours to days, rather than rapidly, to avoid complications such as cerebral hypoperfusion. Therefore, intravenous administration of an ACEI would be the most appropriate initial management for this patient.",
"A 4-month-old boy is brought to the pediatrician by his parents. He presents to the pediatric ward with fever, dyspnea, and cough, which he developed 3 days ago. His mother also reports he had poor weight gain despite a good appetite during the past 2 months as well as frequent stools with an unpleasant smell. He was born at 29 weeks via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is meeting all of his milestones and is up to date with all vaccines. The child is breastfed exclusively. His blood pressure is 80/50 mm Hg, the heart rate is 109/min, the respiratory rate is 29/min, and the temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F). The patient’s weight is between the 5th and 10th percentile. His length is between the 50th and 75th percentile. The patient is sluggish and reacts torpidly to examination. His skin is pale and dry with decreased turgor and elasticity. On auscultation, there are diminished vesicular sounds and disseminated moist rales at the bases of both lungs. Heart sounds are normal. The abdomen is distended without palpable masses. The patient’s blood analysis shows the following findings:
Complete blood count 
 Erythrocytes  3.3 x 106/mm3
 Hb  12 g/dL
 Total leukocyte count  17,500/mm3
 Neutrophils

Sputum culture grows Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A sweat test shows chloride concentration of 85 mEq/L (elevated). Which of the following is involved in the pathogenesis of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Neutrophil elastase damages lung tissue due to lack of alpha-1-antitrypsin.
(B): Abnormal CFTR protein
(C): Eosinophils infiltrate blood vessel walls.
(D): Electron transport chain in mitochondria is disrupted due to lack of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
(E): Due to mutations in dynein, the ciliary epithelium fails to provide appropriate mucociliary clearance.
",Abnormal CFTR protein,Correct,"The correct answer is (B): Abnormal CFTR protein.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fever, dyspnea, cough, poor weight gain, and frequent stools with an unpleasant smell, along with the physical examination findings of pale and dry skin, decreased turgor and elasticity, and auscultatory findings of diminished vesicular sounds and disseminated moist rales, are consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes for a chloride channel protein. The abnormal CFTR protein leads to impaired chloride and water transport across epithelial cells, resulting in thickened secretions in various organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract.

In this patient, the elevated chloride concentration on the sweat test further supports the diagnosis of CF. The presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the sputum culture is also common in CF, as the thickened mucus provides an ideal environment for bacterial growth.

The other options are not involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's symptoms:
(A): Neutrophil elastase damages lung tissue due to lack of alpha-1-antitrypsin. This is not relevant to CF pathogenesis.
(C): Eosinophils infiltrate blood vessel walls. Eosinophil infiltration is not a characteristic feature of CF.
(D): Electron transport chain in mitochondria is disrupted due to lack of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This is not relevant to CF pathogenesis.
(E): Due to mutations in dynein, the ciliary epithelium fails to provide appropriate mucociliary clearance. This is not relevant to CF pathogenesis.",
"A 15-year-old girl is brought to the physician by her mother because of worsening grades over the past year. Since she started high school one year ago, her academic performance has decreased. She also has had difficulty finding friends at the new school. She is afraid that her classmates will make fun of her and think that she is “stupid.” One month ago, when she had to give a presentation, she could not stop wondering how her classmates were going to react if she said something wrong. During the presentation, her heart started racing and she became flushed. Since this event, she avoids saying anything in class. She spends her breaks in the restroom because she is worried that nobody will talk to her. Physical and neurologic examinations show no abnormalities. On mental status examination, the girl avoids eye contact and appears uncomfortable and anxious. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Clomipramine
(B): Phenelzine
(C): Clonazepam
(D): Fluoxetine
(E): Propranolol
",Fluoxetine,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Fluoxetine.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and presentation, she is likely experiencing social anxiety disorder (SAD). SAD is characterized by excessive fear and anxiety in social situations, leading to avoidance behaviors. The patient's fear of being judged by her classmates, avoidance of speaking in class, and spending breaks in the restroom to avoid interaction are all consistent with SAD.

Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's condition. SSRIs are considered first-line treatment for SAD due to their efficacy and tolerability. They work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain, which helps regulate mood and anxiety.

Clomipramine (A) is a tricyclic antidepressant that is not typically used as a first-line treatment for SAD. It may have more side effects and is generally reserved for cases that do not respond to SSRIs.

Phenelzine (B) is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) that can be effective for SAD. However, it is not commonly used as a first-line treatment due to dietary restrictions and potential drug interactions.

Clonazepam (C) is a benzodiazepine that can provide short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. However, it is not recommended as a first-line treatment for SAD due to the risk of dependence and withdrawal symptoms.

Propranolol (E) is a beta-blocker that can help reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety, such as rapid heart rate and flushing. While it may be used as an adjunctive treatment for SAD, it is not typically used as monotherapy.

In summary, fluoxetine (D) is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient's social anxiety disorder. It is a first-line treatment that can help alleviate her symptoms and improve her overall functioning.",
"A 3-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his parents because he ‘hasn’t been himself lately’ and reportedly gets tired very easily from his swimming classes in comparison to the other kids. He also ‘can’t catch his breath’ at times. The mother also reports that he seems to be slightly shorter than other children his age. His temperature is 36.6°C (97.9°F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, and respiratory rate is 14/min. On auscultation, a localized harsh pansystolic murmur is heard over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd–3rd intercostal space. The murmur becomes louder when the patient is asked to squat. An echocardiogram is performed. Which of the structures below gives rise to the defective structure that is causing this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Aortopulmonary septum
(B): Endocardial cushion
(C): Infundibular septum
(D): 3rd pharyngeal arch
(E): Rathke’s pouch
",Endocardial cushion,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Endocardial cushion.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, shortness of breath, and a harsh pansystolic murmur, are suggestive of a congenital heart defect. The murmur becoming louder when the patient squats indicates that the defect is likely due to increased blood flow across the defect. This is consistent with a left-to-right shunt, which is commonly seen in atrial septal defects (ASDs) and ventricular septal defects (VSDs).

The location of the murmur over the left sternal border at the level of the 2nd-3rd intercostal space suggests that the defect involves the atrioventricular (AV) valves. The AV valves are formed by the fusion of the endocardial cushions, which are mesenchymal structures that develop in the atrioventricular canal during embryogenesis.

Therefore, the defective structure that is causing this patient's symptoms is the endocardial cushion.",
"A 26-year-old woman developed rapidly progressive septic shock associated with nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura. She tested positive for both Kernig and Brudzinski's signs and shows signs of confusion, dyspnea, and hypotension. The blood culture results confirmed the presence of Neisseria meningitidis, and a complete blood count (CBC) revealed leukocytosis. Which one of the cytokines below takes part in the pathogenesis of septic shock?
Options:
(A): Tumor necrosis factor-α
(B): Interleukin-5
(C): Interleukin-12
(D): Interferon-α
(E): Interleukin-4
",Tumor necrosis factor-α,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Tumor necrosis factor-α.

Explanation:
In the context of septic shock associated with Neisseria meningitidis infection, the cytokine that takes part in the pathogenesis is tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Septic shock is a severe systemic inflammatory response to infection, characterized by hypotension, organ dysfunction, and tissue damage. In septic shock, an inflammatory stimulus, such as bacterial toxins, triggers the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α and interleukin-1 (IL-1). These cytokines cause neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion, activate the clotting mechanism, and generate microthrombi. They also release other mediators, such as leukotrienes, histamine, and IL-2. High levels of TNF-α and IL-1 can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypotensive shock, and metabolic disturbances, which are characteristic of septic shock.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of rapidly progressive septic shock, nuchal rigidity, petechiae, and purpura, along with positive Kernig and Brudzinski's signs, are consistent with meningococcal meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis. The blood culture results confirming the presence of Neisseria meningitidis and the leukocytosis seen on the CBC further support this diagnosis. In meningococcal septicemia, the pathogenesis of septic shock involves the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, which contribute to the development of shock and organ dysfunction.",
"A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of difficulty swallowing for the past 3 months. He feels solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum when he eats. Drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing. He has no coughing or nasal regurgitation. He has no hoarseness or weight loss. He has had heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole. His past medical history is also significant for asthma and eczema. He takes no medications except for omeprazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows no abnormal findings. Which of the following best explains these findings?
Options:
(A): Achalasia
(B): Diffuse esophageal spasm
(C): Eosinophilic esophagitis
(D): Esophageal reflux disease
(E): Schatzki’s ring
",Eosinophilic esophagitis,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Eosinophilic esophagitis.

Eosinophilic esophagitis is the best explanation for the patient's symptoms. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic immune-mediated disorder characterized by inflammation of the esophagus. It is often associated with a history of allergies, asthma, and eczema, which the patient in this case has. 

The patient's difficulty swallowing, specifically with solid food getting stuck in his chest behind the sternum, is a common symptom of eosinophilic esophagitis. This is known as dysphagia. The fact that drinking does not cause any difficulty swallowing suggests that the problem is specific to solid food, which is consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis.

The patient's lack of coughing or nasal regurgitation, as well as the absence of hoarseness or weight loss, also support the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis. These symptoms are not typically associated with other conditions such as achalasia or esophageal reflux disease.

Additionally, the patient's history of heartburn for 2 years with no response to high-dose omeprazole is not consistent with esophageal reflux disease. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor commonly used to treat acid reflux, and the lack of response suggests that acid reflux is not the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

In summary, the patient's symptoms of difficulty swallowing, along with his history of allergies, asthma, and eczema, point towards eosinophilic esophagitis as the most likely explanation for his findings.",
"A 33-year-old man presents to the emergency department with altered mental status. He was at work as a construction worker when his coworkers found him down at the work site. The patient recently underwent anesthesia for an appendectomy several months ago. He also has a past medical history of schizophrenia well controlled with haloperidol and is currently taking phenytoin for epilepsy. He is also currently taking propranolol for anxiety and hyperthyroidism. His temperature is 106°F (41.1°C), blood pressure is 109/62 mmHg, pulse is 170/min, respirations are 23/min, and oxygen saturation is 95% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an altered man with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 10. He has minimal muscle tone and is incoherent when answering questions. The patient is covered in sweat and dirt. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Exertional heat stroke
(B): Malignant hyperthermia
(C): Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
(D): Status epilepticus
(E): Thyroid storm
",Exertional heat stroke,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Exertional heat stroke.

Exertional heat stroke is the most likely diagnosis in this case based on the patient's presentation and the context provided. The patient is a construction worker who was found down at the work site, suggesting that he was exposed to high temperatures and physical exertion. The elevated temperature of 106°F (41.1°C), along with altered mental status, minimal muscle tone, and incoherence, are consistent with the diagnosis of exertional heat stroke.

Malignant hyperthermia is less likely in this case because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with heat stroke rather than a reaction to anesthesia or muscle relaxants. Malignant hyperthermia typically presents with hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and metabolic acidosis in response to certain medications used during anesthesia.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is also less likely in this case. While the patient does have a history of schizophrenia and is taking haloperidol, the symptoms of NMS typically include hyperthermia, altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and generalized muscle rigidity. The patient's presentation is more consistent with heat stroke rather than NMS.

Status epilepticus is unlikely in this case because the patient's altered mental status and minimal muscle tone are not typical of a seizure disorder. Additionally, the patient's history of epilepsy and current use of phenytoin suggest that his seizures are well-controlled.

Thyroid storm is also less likely in this case. While the patient is taking propranolol for hyperthyroidism, the symptoms of thyroid storm typically include fever, tachycardia, hypertension, and severe agitation or delirium. The patient's presentation is more consistent with heat stroke rather than thyroid storm.

In summary, based on the patient's occupation, exposure to high temperatures, altered mental status, elevated temperature, and minimal muscle tone, the most likely diagnosis is exertional heat stroke.",
"A 67-year-old man is brought to the hospital by his relatives. He complains of early satiety, abdominal discomfort after food intake, and abdominal bloating. These symptoms have been present since the patient was 52, but they were milder at that time so he paid little attention to them since. Tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities began a few months ago. His relatives also note that he has become excessively somnolent and forgetful. The patient’s medical history is significant for acute hepatitis B 20 years ago. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day and drinks alcohol occasionally. His weight is 61 kg (134.5 lb), height is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in), and BMI is 18.6 kg/m2. His vital signs include: blood pressure 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 13/min, and temperature 36.1°C (96.9°F). The patient’s skin is pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic. Lymph nodes and the thyroid gland are not enlarged. Lung and heart examinations are within normal limits for his age. The patient’s tongue is bright red with atrophic papillae. The abdomen is distended and tender to palpation in the epigastric area. Neurological examination shows symmetrical bilateral distal hypoesthesia for all sensations and decreased muscle strength in both upper and lower extremities. On a mini-mental status examination, the patient scores 25. The patient’s blood test results are as follows:
Erythrocytes 2.8 x 109/mm3
Hb 8.6 g/dL
Ht 37%
Mean corpuscular hemoglobin  49.9 pg/cell (3.1 fmol/cell)
Mean corpuscular volume 142 µm3 (142 fL)
Reticulocyte count 0.3%
Total leukocyte count 3,070/mm3

Amylase 32 U/L
Total bilirubin 32 µmol/L (1.87 mg/dL)
Conjugated bilirubin 8 µmol/L (0.4677 mg/L)
Which of the following options best explains the patient’s neurological and psychiatric symptoms?
Options:
(A): Chronic bilirubin toxicity
(B): Chronic hyperglycemia
(C): Chronic acetaldehyde influence
(D): Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids
(E): Influence of pseudo-neurotransmitters
",Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

The patient's symptoms, including tingling and decreased sensation in both lower extremities, excessive somnolence, and forgetfulness, are indicative of neurological and psychiatric symptoms. These symptoms are consistent with a deficiency in vitamin B12, which can lead to impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids.

The patient's medical history of acute hepatitis B 20 years ago, along with his current symptoms of early satiety, abdominal discomfort, and abdominal bloating, suggest the possibility of chronic liver disease. Chronic liver disease can lead to impaired absorption of vitamin B12, resulting in a deficiency.

The patient's blood test results also support the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. The low hemoglobin (Hb) level, along with the low mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) values, indicate a microcytic anemia, which can be seen in vitamin B12 deficiency. Additionally, the patient's pale, thin, dry, and hypoelastic skin is consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Vitamin B12 is essential for the synthesis of myelin, the protective covering of nerve fibers. Impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids due to vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological symptoms such as tingling, decreased sensation, and muscle weakness.

Therefore, impaired methylation of myelin phospholipids best explains the patient's neurological and psychiatric symptoms.",
"A four-day-old neonate is brought to the pediatrician with vaginal discharge for the last two days. Her mother is concerned about the blood-tinged discharge but states that her daughter has been feeding and voiding well. The neonate was delivered at 39 weeks gestation by an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, and she and her mother were discharged home after two days. The prenatal course was complicated by chlamydia in the mother during the first trimester, for which she and the partner were both treated with a negative test of cure. The neonate’s biological father is no longer involved the patient's care, but her mother’s boyfriend has been caring for the baby whenever the mother rests. At this visit, the neonate’s temperature is 98.5°F (36.9°C), pulse is 138/min, and respirations are 51/min. She appears comfortable, and cardiopulmonary and abdominal exams are unremarkable. There are no bruises or marks on her skin. Examination of the genitals reveals no vulvar irritation or skin changes, but there is scant pink mucoid discharge at the introitus. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Vaginal exam under anesthesia
(B): Report to child protective services
(C): Vaginal culture
(D): Warm water irrigation of the vagina
(E): Reassurance
",Reassurance,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Reassurance.

Explanation:
In a four-day-old neonate with vaginal discharge, the most likely cause is physiologic leukorrhea. Physiologic leukorrhea is a common finding in newborns and is due to the withdrawal of maternal hormones. It typically presents as a mucoid or blood-tinged discharge from the vagina and does not require any intervention. The absence of vulvar irritation or skin changes further supports this diagnosis. 

Vaginal exam under anesthesia (A) is not necessary in this case as the physical examination findings are consistent with physiologic leukorrhea and there are no concerning features to suggest any other pathology. 

Reporting to child protective services (B) is not indicated in this case as there are no signs of abuse or neglect. The mother's concern about the discharge and bringing the neonate to the pediatrician for evaluation demonstrates appropriate care and concern for the child's well-being. 

Vaginal culture (C) is not necessary in this case as the clinical presentation and absence of other concerning findings are consistent with physiologic leukorrhea. 

Warm water irrigation of the vagina (D) is not recommended as it may disrupt the normal flora and potentially introduce infection. 

Reassurance (E) is the best next step in management. The pediatrician should explain to the mother that the vaginal discharge is likely due to physiologic leukorrhea, a normal finding in newborns, and does not require any intervention. The mother should be reassured that her daughter is otherwise well and that the discharge will resolve on its own.",
"A 53-year-old male presents to his primary care physician complaining of fatigue and joint and muscle pain. He reports a 6-month history of slowly progressive tiredness associated with dull achy pain in his knees, hips, and shoulders. His past medical history is notable for hypertension, diabetes, and stable angina. He takes lisinopril, metformin, glyburide, and aspirin. He has a history of intravenous drug use and was homeless in his early 30’s. He drinks alcohol socially and has a 30 pack-year smoking history. His temperature is 98.6°F (37°C), blood pressure is 130/85 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 18/min. Physical examination reveals a generally well-appearing male without evidence of ascites, peripheral edema, or jaundice. Results from laboratory tests are below:

Hepatitis A IgM: Negative
Hepatitis A IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B E antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B core antigen: Negative
Hepatitis B surface IgG: Positive
Hepatitis B E IgG: Negative
Hepatitis B core IgG: Negative
Hepatitis C IgG: Positive
HCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml

This patient should be started on which of the following medications?
Options:
(A): Sofosbuvir and simeprevir
(B): Interferon-alpha
(C): Interferon-gamma
(D): Ribavirin
(E): Lamivudine
",Sofosbuvir and simeprevir,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Sofosbuvir and simeprevir.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario has a positive Hepatitis C IgG and a high viral load (HCV RNA: 100,000,000 IU/ml), indicating chronic Hepatitis C infection. The recommended treatment for chronic Hepatitis C infection is direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. Sofosbuvir and simeprevir are both DAAs that have been shown to be highly effective in treating Hepatitis C.

Interferon-alpha (B) was previously used as a treatment for Hepatitis C, but it is associated with significant side effects and lower cure rates compared to DAA therapy. It is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment.

Interferon-gamma (C) is not used in the treatment of Hepatitis C.

Ribavirin (D) is an antiviral medication that was previously used in combination with interferon for the treatment of Hepatitis C. However, it is no longer recommended as a first-line treatment due to its side effects and the availability of more effective DAA therapies.

Lamivudine (E) is an antiviral medication that is used to treat Hepatitis B, not Hepatitis C. It is not effective against Hepatitis C and is not recommended for this patient.",
"A 40-year-old woman presents to her family physician with a 3-week history of swollen neck. The small, round, and painless swelling, which was detected 3 weeks ago in the middle of her neck, has now increased in size. The swelling is associated with sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue; however, the patient does not complain of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling. The patient’s medical history is negative for similar symptoms or a thyroid disorder. The vital signs are within normal limits. Local examination reveals a 3 x 3 cm round, non-tender, non-fluctuant, and non-pulsatile swelling in the anterior triangle of her neck. The patient carries a total white blood cell count of 10,200/mm3, including 70% neutrophils, 30% lymphocytes, and zero eosinophils.The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 20 mm/hr (normal, 0–29 mm/hr). What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Graves' disease
(B): De Quervain’s thyroiditis
(C): Silent thyroiditis
(D): Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
(E): Riedel's thyroiditis
",Silent thyroiditis,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Silent thyroiditis.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation, the most likely diagnosis is silent thyroiditis. Silent thyroiditis is a self-limited inflammatory condition of the thyroid gland that presents with painless thyroid swelling. It is characterized by hyperthyroidism followed by a euthyroid state and eventually hypothyroidism. The patient's symptoms of sweaty palms and soles, insomnia, irritability, nervousness, and fatigue are consistent with hyperthyroidism. The absence of fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, weight loss, vision problems, or body swelling helps to differentiate silent thyroiditis from other causes of thyroid swelling. The normal white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate also support the diagnosis of silent thyroiditis. Graves' disease, another cause of hyperthyroidism, typically presents with diffuse thyroid enlargement, whereas De Quervain's thyroiditis is associated with painful thyroid swelling. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by a painless, diffuse, and firm thyroid enlargement. Riedel's thyroiditis is a rare condition characterized by a hard, fixed, and painless thyroid mass.",
"A 27-year-old woman with no past medical history presents to the emergency department with recurrent wrist and neck pain for the last 2 months. She reports that her fingers feel stiff in the morning and the symptoms tend to improve as the day progresses. She denies any recent trauma or other inciting events. Family history is significant for a grandmother who suffered from fibromyalgia. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, respiratory rate is 16/min, and heart rate is 70/min. On physical examination, her metacarpophalangeal joints are erythematous and tender. Which of the following would be most helpful for diagnosing this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Synovial fluid analysis
(B): Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody
(C): Rheumatoid factor
(D): CT scan
(E): X-ray of cervical spine
",Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of recurrent wrist and neck pain, morning stiffness in the fingers, and erythematous and tender metacarpophalangeal joints, along with the family history of fibromyalgia, the most likely diagnosis is rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 

The most helpful test for diagnosing RA in this patient is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody test. This test has a high specificity for RA and is more specific than the rheumatoid factor (RF) test. RF can be positive in other conditions as well, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and hepatitis C infection, leading to false-positive results. 

Synovial fluid analysis is useful in diagnosing other joint conditions, such as septic arthritis or crystal-induced arthritis, but it is not specific for RA. 

A CT scan or X-ray of the cervical spine would not be the most helpful test for diagnosing RA in this patient, as the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with peripheral joint involvement rather than cervical spine involvement. 

Therefore, the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis of RA in this patient is the anti-CCP antibody test.",
"A 66-year-old man comes to the physician because of fatigue and swelling of his legs and feet for 6 weeks. During this time he has felt like his eyes have been unusually puffy in the mornings and his urine has been frothy. He has hypertension and rheumatoid factor-positive rheumatoid arthritis. Current medications include amlodipine, methotrexate, and ibuprofen. He does not smoke. He has a history of chronic alcohol abuse. His temperature is 36.7°C (98°F), pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 148/86 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pallor, periorbital edema, 2+ pedal edema, and ascites.

Ultrasound of the liver and kidneys shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's findings?""
Options:
(A): Adverse effect of ibuprofen
(B): Decreased cardiac ejection fraction
(C): Renal deposition of AL amyloid
(D): Increased serum amyloid A production
(E): Renal deposition of anti-dsDNA immune complexes
",Increased serum amyloid A production,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Increased serum amyloid A production.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. The most likely cause of his findings is increased serum amyloid A (SAA) production. SAA is an acute-phase reactant that is produced in response to inflammation. In chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, SAA levels can become chronically elevated. This can lead to the deposition of amyloid in various organs, including the kidneys, resulting in nephrotic syndrome. The presence of periorbital edema, frothy urine, and ascites further support the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. The other options are less likely to be the cause of this patient's findings. Ibuprofen can cause acute kidney injury, but it is unlikely to cause the chronic kidney damage seen in this patient. Decreased cardiac ejection fraction would typically present with symptoms of heart failure, such as dyspnea and orthopnea, which are not described in this patient. Renal deposition of AL amyloid is associated with multiple myeloma, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Renal deposition of anti-dsDNA immune complexes is seen in systemic lupus erythematosus, which is not consistent with this patient's presentation.",
"A 35-year-old woman presents with an unsteady and broad-based gait, dysmetria, and intention tremor in the distal upper extremities. Her past medical history is relevant for depression, personality changes, and declining work performance, for which she has been put on leave from her current job as an elementary school teacher. On physical examination, patient has dysarthria, dystonia, and an ataxic gait. Ophthalmologic examination reveals multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery (findings shown in the photo). Sensation and motor functions are preserved. Which of the following would you expect to be abnormally accumulated in this patient’s tissues?
Options:
(A): Arsenic
(B): Iron
(C): Copper
(D): Lead
(E): Mercury
",Copper,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Copper.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with Wilson disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by defective hepatic copper transport, resulting in copper accumulation throughout the body. The symptoms of Wilson disease typically present in late childhood or early adulthood and can involve multiple organ systems.

The neurological symptoms seen in this patient, including an unsteady and broad-based gait, dysmetria, intention tremor, dysarthria, and dystonia, are due to copper accumulation in the basal ganglia and cerebellum. The ataxic gait and intention tremor are characteristic of cerebellar dysfunction.

The ophthalmologic findings of multi-colored irises with concentric rings around the periphery, known as Kayser-Fleischer rings, are pathognomonic for Wilson disease. These rings result from copper deposition in Descemet membrane of the cornea.

Other manifestations of Wilson disease can include hepatocellular dysfunction, leading to hepatomegaly, jaundice, and cirrhosis, as well as renal involvement, resulting in renal tubular dysfunction and the development of renal calculi.

In summary, the abnormal accumulation of copper in this patient's tissues is responsible for her neurological symptoms, ophthalmologic findings, and potentially hepatic and renal dysfunction.",
"A 6-year-old Russian boy who recently immigrated to the United States presents to your office with fever and dyspnea. On examination of the oropharynx, you note a grayish-white pseudomembrane and uneven elevation of the soft palate. The patient displays marked enlargement of the cervical lymph nodes. Which of the following describes the organism responsible for this patient's disease?
Options:
(A): Yeast with pseudohyphae
(B): Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation
(C): Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule
(D): Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease
(E): Gram-negative bacteria producing exotoxin that inactivates elongation factor 2
",Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): Gram-positive bacteria producing exotoxin that acts via ADP ribosylation.

Explanation:
The presentation of a grayish-white pseudomembrane on the tonsil, along with fever, dyspnea, and marked enlargement of cervical lymph nodes, is highly suggestive of respiratory diphtheria. The organism responsible for this disease is Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a gram-positive bacteria that produces an exotoxin. This exotoxin acts via ADP ribosylation, which leads to the characteristic symptoms and complications of diphtheria.

Option (A): Yeast with pseudohyphae is not the correct choice because yeast infections, such as candidiasis, typically present with white patches or plaques, not a grayish-white pseudomembrane. Additionally, yeast infections are not associated with marked enlargement of cervical lymph nodes.

Option (C): Gram-positive cocci with hyaluronic acid capsule is not the correct choice because this description is more consistent with Streptococcus pyogenes, which causes streptococcal tonsillitis. However, streptococcal tonsillitis does not typically present with a grayish-white pseudomembrane or marked enlargement of cervical lymph nodes.

Option (D): Gram-negative encapsulated bacteria producing IgA protease is not the correct choice because this description is more consistent with Haemophilus influenzae, which can cause respiratory infections. However, H. influenzae infections do not typically present with a grayish-white pseudomembrane or marked enlargement of cervical lymph nodes.

Option (E): Gram-negative bacteria producing exotoxin that inactivates elongation factor 2 is not the correct choice because this description is more consistent with Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the organism responsible for respiratory diphtheria.",
"A 17-year-old male presents to the emergency department after a motor vehicle accident. The patient was an unrestrained driver in a head-on collision. He has a past medical history of asthma, depression, and anxiety. He is not currently taking any medications. His temperature is 99.5°F (37.5°C), blood pressure is 90/60 mmHg, pulse is 115/min, respirations are 22/min, and oxygen saturation is 99% on room air. The patient's cardiopulmonary exam is within normal limits. The patient is breathing on his own and has strong distal pulses. Ultimately, the patient is discharged with follow up instructions after no significant fractures or injuries are found. The patient then presents 4 months later to his primary doctor with weakness. The patient's strength in his upper extremities is 1/5. He has reduced sensation in his upper extremities as well. The patient's lower extremities reveal 5/5 strength with intact sensation. A chest radiograph and basic labs are ordered. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Cervical spine fracture
(B): Intracranial hemorrhage
(C): Syringomyelia
(D): Brachial plexopathy
(E): Conversion disorder
",Syringomyelia,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Syringomyelia.

Explanation:
Syringomyelia is the most likely diagnosis in this patient based on the clinical presentation. Syringomyelia is a condition characterized by the formation of a fluid-filled cavity (syrinx) within the spinal cord. It is often associated with trauma or congenital abnormalities, such as Chiari malformation. In this case, the patient's history of a motor vehicle accident and the presence of weakness and reduced sensation in the upper extremities suggest syringomyelia.

Cervical spine fracture (A) is less likely in this patient because there were no significant fractures or injuries found during the initial evaluation after the motor vehicle accident. Additionally, cervical spine fractures typically present with neck pain and tenderness, which are not mentioned in the patient's presentation.

Intracranial hemorrhage (B) is less likely in this patient because there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of a head injury. The patient's mental status is normal, and there is no mention of headache, vomiting, or other neurological symptoms associated with intracranial hemorrhage.

Brachial plexopathy (D) is less likely in this patient because it typically presents with weakness and sensory deficits in the distribution of the affected nerves. In this case, the patient's weakness and sensory deficits are limited to the upper extremities, while the lower extremities have normal strength and sensation.

Conversion disorder (E) is less likely in this patient because conversion disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion and should only be considered after ruling out organic causes. In this case, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a structural abnormality (syringomyelia) rather than a functional disorder like conversion disorder.",
"A 62-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for the last 15 years. Current medications include glyburide and amlodipine. The physician prescribes a medication that decreases the production of mevalonate. Which of the following changes to the serum is most likely to develop as an adverse effect of the prescribed drug?
Options:
(A): Increased creatine kinase concentration
(B): Decreased glucose concentration
(C): Increased lactate concentration
(D): Increased triglyceride concentration
(E): Increased bradykinin concentration
",Increased creatine kinase concentration,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Increased creatine kinase concentration.

Explanation:
The medication that decreases the production of mevalonate is most likely a statin, which is commonly used to lower cholesterol levels. Statins work by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is involved in the production of cholesterol and other substances, including mevalonate.

Creatine kinase (CK) is an enzyme found in various tissues, including muscle tissue. When muscle tissue is damaged, CK is released into the bloodstream. Therefore, an increase in CK concentration in the serum is an indicator of muscle damage.

One of the known adverse effects of statins is muscle-related side effects, including myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Myopathy refers to muscle pain or weakness, while rhabdomyolysis is a more severe condition characterized by the breakdown of muscle tissue. Both of these conditions can lead to an increase in CK concentration in the serum.

Given the patient's history of smoking, hypertension, and diabetes, she may already be at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Therefore, it is important to monitor her CK levels while on statin therapy to detect any potential muscle-related side effects.",
"A 21-year-old woman comes to the physician for evaluation of excess hair growth on her face. Menses occur irregularly at 45 to 65-day intervals. She is 159 cm (5 ft 3 in) tall and weighs 59 kg (130 lb); BMI is 23 kg/m2. Physical examination shows facial acne and growth of coarse dark hair on the face, chest, and lower back. Pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. Serum studies show:
Sodium 141 mEq/L
Potassium 4.2 mEq/L

17-hydroxyprogesterone 390 ng/dL (N=20–300 ng/dL)
Testosterone 91 ng/dL (N=8–60 ng/dL)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. This patient's condition is most likely associated with which of the following?""
Options:
(A): Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells
(B): Exogenous anabolic steroid use
(C): Compression of the infundibular stalk
(D): Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles
(E): Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex
",Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized by hyperandrogenism, menstrual irregularities, and polycystic ovaries. The elevated testosterone levels and hirsutism (excess hair growth) are indicative of hyperandrogenism. In PCOS, there is an imbalance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, leading to increased androgen production by the ovaries. 

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings:
(A) Hyperproliferation of theca interna cells: Theca interna cells are responsible for androgen production in the ovaries. In PCOS, there is an increase in the number of these cells, leading to excess androgen production. This option is incorrect.
(B) Exogenous anabolic steroid use: Exogenous anabolic steroid use can cause hirsutism, but it is not the most likely cause in this patient. The clinical presentation and laboratory findings are more consistent with PCOS. This option is incorrect.
(C) Compression of the infundibular stalk: Compression of the infundibular stalk can lead to pituitary dysfunction and hormonal imbalances. However, this is not the most likely cause in this patient. This option is incorrect.
(D) Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles: Ovarian fibrosis and multiple cystic follicles are characteristic findings in PCOS. However, the primary abnormality in PCOS is hyperandrogenism, which is caused by increased androgen production by the ovaries. This option is incorrect.

Therefore, the most likely cause of this patient's condition is hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex, which leads to increased androgen production.",
"A 64-year-old man with coronary artery disease and hypertension comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. His blood pressure ranged from 160/100 mm Hg to 150/94 mm Hg on his previous 3 visits over the past 4 months. Current medications include aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol. Three weeks ago, he was also started on amlodipine. His blood pressure today is 158/98 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no other abnormalities. Renal duplex ultrasonography shows 90% occlusion of the right renal artery. Decreased renal blood flow is most likely to cause which of the following?
Options:
(A): Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells
(B): Dilation of efferent arteriole
(C): Mesangial expansion and glomerular basement membrane thickening
(D): Decreased prostaglandin synthesis by macula densa
(E): Decreased reabsorption of bicarbonate at proximal tubule
",Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient has a 90% occlusion of the right renal artery, leading to decreased renal blood flow. This decreased blood flow triggers a compensatory response in the affected kidney, specifically in the juxtaglomerular cells. These cells are located in the walls of the afferent arterioles, which supply blood to the glomerulus. 

When there is decreased blood flow to the kidney, the juxtaglomerular cells release renin, an enzyme that plays a key role in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Renin acts on angiotensinogen to convert it to angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and also stimulates the release of aldosterone, leading to sodium and water retention.

The release of renin by the juxtaglomerular cells is a compensatory mechanism to increase blood pressure and restore renal perfusion. Over time, this chronic stimulation of the juxtaglomerular cells can lead to hyperplasia, or an increase in the number of these cells. This hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells is a characteristic finding in renovascular hypertension, which is caused by renal artery stenosis or occlusion.

Therefore, in this case, the decreased renal blood flow caused by the occlusion of the right renal artery is most likely to result in hyperplasia of juxtaglomerular cells.",
"A 65-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband after he found her with nausea, headache, and agitation 1 hour ago. When he left their lakeside cabin 6 hours before to go ice fishing and get more firewood, she did not have any symptoms. She has chronic migraines, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Her medications include lisinopril and metformin, but she ran out of her anti-hypertensive medications over the weekend. Her temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are 21/min, and blood pressure is 154/92 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 98%. She is confused and oriented only to person and place. She recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Her gait is unsteady. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition?
Options:
(A): Intravenous nitroprusside
(B): Intranasal sumatriptan
(C): Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
(D): 100% oxygen therapy
(E): Heliox therapy
",Hyperbaric oxygen therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, she is presenting with acute carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. CO poisoning can occur from exposure to sources such as faulty heating systems, car exhaust, or fires. The symptoms of CO poisoning can be nonspecific and can range from mild to severe, depending on the level and duration of exposure.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of nausea, headache, agitation, confusion, and unsteady gait, along with her history of being in a lakeside cabin, raise suspicion for CO poisoning. The absence of abnormalities on physical examination does not rule out CO poisoning, as the symptoms are primarily due to the binding of CO to hemoglobin, leading to tissue hypoxia.

The most effective intervention for CO poisoning is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). HBOT involves breathing 100% oxygen in a pressurized chamber, which helps to rapidly eliminate CO from the body and restore oxygenation to tissues. It reduces the half-life of CO from 4-5 hours on room air to 40-50 minutes under hyperbaric conditions. HBOT also helps to prevent delayed neurological sequelae associated with CO poisoning.

Intravenous nitroprusside (option A) is not indicated in this case, as it is a medication used for the treatment of hypertensive emergencies, not CO poisoning.

Intranasal sumatriptan (option B) is a medication used for the treatment of migraines, but it is not indicated for CO poisoning.

100% oxygen therapy (option D) is a potential treatment for CO poisoning, but it is not as effective as hyperbaric oxygen therapy. HBOT is the preferred treatment for moderate to severe cases of CO poisoning.

Heliox therapy (option E) is a mixture of helium and oxygen and is used in certain respiratory conditions to improve gas flow. It is not indicated for CO poisoning.

Therefore, the most effective intervention for this patient's current condition is hyperbaric oxygen therapy (option C).",
"A 62-year-old Caucasian male presents to the emergency room with severe substernal chest pain, diaphoresis, and nausea. Imaging reveals transmural myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. Which of this patient's coronary arteries is most likely occluded?
Options:
(A): Left circumflex
(B): Left anterior descending
(C): Diagonal perforators
(D): Septal perforators
(E): Right main
",Right main,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Right main.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a myocardial infarction in the posterior 1/3 of the ventricular septum. The most likely occluded coronary artery in this scenario is the right main coronary artery.

The right main coronary artery is responsible for supplying blood to the right atrium, right ventricle, and the posterior part of the interventricular septum. Occlusion of this artery can lead to ischemia and subsequent infarction in these areas.

The left circumflex artery primarily supplies the lateral wall of the left ventricle and the posterior descending artery (PDA). It is not the most likely artery to be occluded in this case.

The left anterior descending artery (LAD) supplies the anterior wall of the left ventricle and the anterior part of the interventricular septum. While occlusion of the LAD can cause an anterior myocardial infarction, it is not the most likely artery to be occluded in this case.

The diagonal perforators and septal perforators are branches of the LAD and are not the most likely arteries to be occluded in this case.

Therefore, based on the location of the myocardial infarction and the distribution of blood supply, the right main coronary artery is the most likely occluded artery in this patient.",
"A previously healthy, 24-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-week history of loose, nonbloody stools. He also reports abdominal pain, intermittent nausea, and fever. He has not had vomiting, tenesmus, or rectal pain. His vital signs are within normal limits. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness of the right lower abdomen without rebound tenderness. Rectal exam is unremarkable. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 14,800/mm3 and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 51 mm/h. Test of the stool for occult blood and stool studies for infection are negative. A CT scan of the abdomen shows mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding of discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon. A colonoscopy is performed and biopsy specimens of the affected areas of the colon are taken. Which of the following findings is most specific for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Neutrophilic inflammation of the crypts
(B): Neutrophil-rich pseudomembranes
(C): Formation of noncaseating granulomas
(D): Inflammation limited to the mucosa and submucosa
(E): Presence of pseudopolyps
",Formation of noncaseating granulomas,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Formation of noncaseating granulomas.

Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this patient, including the symptoms of loose stools, abdominal pain, intermittent nausea, and fever, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness in the right lower abdomen, suggest an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The laboratory findings of an elevated leukocyte count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate further support an inflammatory process.

The CT scan findings of mural thickening and surrounding fat stranding in discrete regions of the terminal ileum and transverse colon are consistent with Crohn's disease, which is a type of IBD. Crohn's disease is characterized by transmural inflammation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon.

The most specific finding for Crohn's disease on colonoscopy and biopsy is the presence of noncaseating granulomas. Noncaseating granulomas are collections of immune cells, including macrophages and multinucleated giant cells, that are a hallmark of Crohn's disease. These granulomas are typically found in the submucosa and are not seen in other forms of IBD, such as ulcerative colitis.

Therefore, the formation of noncaseating granulomas is the most specific finding for this patient's condition, indicating a diagnosis of Crohn's disease.",
"A 65-year-old man presents with pain in his left thigh for a week. He describes the pain as dull and constant, boring in nature, and localized deep below the thigh muscle. He says it is worse at night. Physical examination is significant for tenderness and warmth over the anterior aspect of the left thigh. A plain radiograph of the left femur shows increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space. Laboratory studies show:
Alkaline phosphatase
925 U/L
Serum calcium
9.2 mg/dL
Serum phosphorus 4.4 mg/dL
Findings on bone biopsy are shown in the image. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Osteomalacia
(B): Ewing's sarcoma
(C): Osteitis deformans
(D): Osteochondritis dissecans
(E): Osteitis fibrosa cystica
",Osteitis deformans,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Osteitis deformans.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of pain in the left thigh, described as dull and constant, localized deep below the thigh muscle, and worse at night, along with tenderness and warmth on physical examination, suggests an inflammatory condition affecting the bone. The plain radiograph findings of increased cortical thickness with widened intercortical space further support this diagnosis.

Osteitis deformans, also known as Paget's disease of bone, is a chronic disorder characterized by abnormal bone remodeling. It typically affects older individuals and commonly involves the pelvis, femur, spine, and skull. The increased cortical thickness and widened intercortical space seen on the radiograph are consistent with the characteristic mixed osteosclerotic-osteolytic lesions seen in Paget's disease.

Ewing's sarcoma (B) is a malignant bone tumor that typically presents in children and young adults. It is characterized by aggressive bone destruction and is unlikely in this older patient.

Osteomalacia (A) is a condition characterized by inadequate mineralization of bone matrix, leading to soft and weak bones. It typically presents with diffuse bone pain and tenderness, rather than the localized pain described in this patient.

Osteochondritis dissecans (D) is a condition characterized by the separation of a segment of cartilage and underlying bone from the joint surface. It typically affects the knee, elbow, or ankle joints and is unlikely to present with the described thigh pain.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica (E) is a manifestation of hyperparathyroidism, characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and the formation of cystic lesions. It typically presents with bone pain, fractures, and skeletal deformities, but the radiographic findings and clinical presentation in this patient are not consistent with this diagnosis.",
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department because of severe abdominal pain and vomiting for 8 hours. He has had around 3–4 episodes of greenish colored vomit during this period. He has major depressive disorder with psychosis. His mother has Graves' disease. Current medications include sertraline and haloperidol. He appears uncomfortable. His temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 87/min, and blood pressure is 118/72 mm Hg. He is diagnosed with acute appendicitis and is taken to the operating room for an emergency laparoscopic appendectomy. The appendix is gangrenous and perforated with purulent fluid in the pelvis. Just after the appendiceal base is ligated, the patient shows muscle rigidity and profuse diaphoresis. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 130/min, and blood pressure is 146/70 mm Hg. The pupils are equal and reactive to light. The end-tidal CO2 is 85 mm Hg. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Propranolol
(B): Dantrolene
(C): Bromocriptine
(D): Cyproheptadine
(E): Surgical embolectomy
",Dantrolene,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Dantrolene.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with malignant hyperthermia (MH), a potentially life-threatening reaction to certain medications used during anesthesia. MH is characterized by hypermetabolism, muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. The most effective treatment for MH is dantrolene, a skeletal muscle relaxant that inhibits calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduces intracellular calcium levels and decreases muscle contraction. Dantrolene should be administered as soon as MH is suspected, and the patient should be transferred to a specialized center for further management. Propranolol (A) is a nonselective beta-blocker and is not indicated for the treatment of MH. Bromocriptine (C) is a dopamine agonist used in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia and Parkinson disease. It is not indicated for the treatment of MH. Cyproheptadine (D) is an antihistamine with antiserotonergic properties. It can be used as an adjunctive treatment for serotonin syndrome, but it is not indicated for the treatment of MH. Surgical embolectomy (E) is not indicated in this patient because there is no evidence of an embolus.",
"After a T cell progenitor leaves the bone marrow, most of its development takes place in the thymus. It passes through several stages during its maturation. Positive selection is an important process during maturation of T lymphocytes, and it ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. During which of the following developmental stages does a T cell undergo this process?
Options:
(A): Double-negative pro-T cell
(B): Pre-T cell
(C): Double-positive T cell
(D): Single-positive CD4+ T cell
(E): Single-positive CD8+ T cell
",Double-positive T cell,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Double-positive T cell.

Explanation:
During the maturation of T lymphocytes in the thymus, positive selection is an important process that ensures the preservation of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cells. Positive selection occurs during the stage of double-positive T cells.

Double-positive T cells express both CD4 and CD8 molecules on their surface. These cells undergo positive selection by interacting with self-peptide-self-MHC complexes presented by thymic epithelial cells. The purpose of positive selection is to select T cells that can recognize foreign antigens when presented in the antigen-recognition site of MHC molecules.

After positive selection, double-positive T cells differentiate into either CD4+ T cells or CD8+ T cells, depending on the strength of the interaction between their T cell receptor (TCR) and self-peptide-MHC complexes. CD4+ T cells recognize MHC class II molecules, while CD8+ T cells recognize MHC class I molecules.

Therefore, the stage of double-positive T cells is where positive selection occurs during the maturation of T lymphocytes in the thymus.",
"A 28-year-old male presents with a recent onset of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks. The patient reports that he returned from active duty in Iraq 3 months ago and was adjusting to life back at home until about 7 weeks ago when he began having intense fear of loud noises and seeing sudden flashbacks to bombing attacks he endured during his time in Iraq. He had to take a leave from his army instructor duties as he was not able to handle the familiar settings of practice shooting ranges and sudden loud explosions during battalion training. After refusing to leave his house, he was finally persuaded by his wife to visit your clinic. What is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Acute stress disorder
(B): Performance anxiety
(C): Schizophrenia
(D): Posttraumatic stress disorder
(E): Panic attack
",Posttraumatic stress disorder,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Posttraumatic stress disorder.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a psychiatric disorder that can develop after experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event. The patient's recent return from active duty in Iraq, along with his symptoms of upsetting dreams, anxiety, and disturbing flashbacks to bombing attacks, are consistent with the diagnosis of PTSD.

The patient's intense fear of loud noises and sudden flashbacks to the traumatic events he experienced in Iraq, as well as his avoidance of familiar settings and activities associated with those events, further support the diagnosis of PTSD. These symptoms are characteristic of the intrusion and avoidance symptoms seen in PTSD.

Performance anxiety, schizophrenia, and panic attack are less likely diagnoses in this case. Performance anxiety typically refers to anxiety related to specific performance situations, such as public speaking or performing on stage, and does not encompass the range of symptoms seen in this patient. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking, which are not described in this patient. Panic attacks are characterized by sudden and intense episodes of fear or discomfort, often accompanied by physical symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and shortness of breath. While the patient may experience panic-like symptoms in certain situations, the presence of other symptoms such as upsetting dreams and flashbacks suggests a diagnosis of PTSD rather than panic disorder.",
"A patient with a1-antitrypsin deficiency is warned by his physician that his increasing dyspnea may be worsened by his continued cigarette smoking. Which of the following factors, released by both neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, is responsible for the patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Major Basic Protein
(B): Antibodies against alpha-3 segment of collagen IV (COL4A3)
(C): Mucus
(D): Surfactant
(E): Elastase
",Elastase,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Elastase.

Explanation:
In patients with a1-antitrypsin deficiency, there is a deficiency of the antiprotease a1-antitrypsin, which normally inhibits proteases, particularly elastase, released by neutrophils and alveolar macrophages. Elastase is responsible for the destruction of alveolar walls, leading to emphysema. Cigarette smoking further exacerbates this condition by activating macrophages and epithelial cells to release chemotactic factors that recruit neutrophils and CD8+ T lymphocytes. These cells release factors that activate fibroblasts, resulting in abnormal repair processes and bronchiolar fibrosis. An imbalance between proteases and antiproteases, such as elastase and a1-antitrypsin, leads to alveolar wall destruction and emphysema.",
"A 54-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus 1 year ago. His only medication is metformin. His serum glucose is 186 mg/dL and his hemoglobin A1c is 7.6%. The physician prescribes an additional antidiabetic drug and counsels the patient on its delayed onset of action. At a follow-up appointment 4 weeks later, the patient reports that his home blood glucose readings have improved. He also mentions that he has had a weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb). The patient has most likely been treated with which of the following drugs?
Options:
(A): Empagliflozin
(B): Liraglutide
(C): Rosiglitazone
(D): Glyburide
(E): Sitagliptin
",Rosiglitazone,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Rosiglitazone.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has been treated with rosiglitazone. Rosiglitazone is a thiazolidinedione (TZD) antidiabetic drug that improves insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin resistance. It has a delayed onset of action, which is why the physician counseled the patient about it. 

The patient's improved blood glucose readings indicate that the addition of rosiglitazone has been effective in controlling his diabetes. However, the weight gain of 4 kg (8.8 lb) is a known side effect of rosiglitazone. Thiazolidinediones, including rosiglitazone, can cause fluid retention and weight gain due to increased adipose tissue deposition. 

Therefore, based on the patient's improved blood glucose readings and weight gain, the most likely drug he has been treated with is rosiglitazone.",
"A 19-year-old woman is brought into the emergency department after collapsing during a cheerleading practice session. Her vitals taken by the emergency medical services (EMS) include blood pressure 88/55 mm Hg, pulse 55/min. She was given a liter of isotonic fluid while en route to the hospital. At the emergency department, she is alert and oriented and is noted to be anorexic. The patient fervently denies being underweight claiming that she is ‘a fatty’ and goes on to refuse any further intravenous fluid and later, even the hospital meals. Which of the following is the best option for long-term management of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Cognitive-behavioral therapy
(B): In-patient medical therapy
(C): In-patient psychiatric therapy
(D): Antidepressants
(E): Appetite stimulants
",Cognitive-behavioral therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Cognitive-behavioral therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is presenting with symptoms consistent with anorexia nervosa, including anorexia, denial of being underweight, and refusal of food and fluids. Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder characterized by an intense fear of gaining weight and a distorted body image. The best option for long-term management of this patient's condition is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).

CBT is a type of psychotherapy that focuses on identifying and changing unhealthy thoughts and behaviors. It has been shown to be effective in treating anorexia nervosa by addressing the underlying psychological factors contributing to the disorder. CBT helps patients challenge their distorted beliefs about body image and weight, develop healthier eating habits, and improve their overall mental well-being.

In-patient medical therapy (option B) may be necessary for patients with severe malnutrition or medical complications, but it is not the best long-term management option for this patient. In-patient psychiatric therapy (option C) may be beneficial for patients with severe psychiatric symptoms or suicidal ideation, but it is not the best option for long-term management in this case.

Antidepressants (option D) may be used as an adjunctive treatment for patients with anorexia nervosa, particularly those with comorbid depression or anxiety. However, they are not the primary treatment for this condition.

Appetite stimulants (option E) may be used in some cases to help increase food intake, but they are not the best long-term management option for anorexia nervosa. The underlying psychological factors need to be addressed through therapy for sustainable recovery.",
"A 45-year-old man comes to the physician for a routine health maintenance examination. He was diagnosed with HIV 15 years ago. He was taking triple antiretroviral therapy but stopped a few months ago because he was feeling well. He lives in Wyoming. Vital signs are within normal limits. Cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. His CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 47/mm3 (N ≥ 500). The patient currently refuses to restart antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following medication regimens is most appropriate at this time?
Options:
(A): Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole
(B): Azithromycin and itraconazole
(C): Azithromycin and amphotericin B
(D): Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin
(E): Dapsone, pyrimethamine, itraconazole, azithromycin
","Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin",Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient has a CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 47/mm3, which is significantly below the normal range (≥ 500). This indicates severe immunosuppression and puts the patient at risk for opportunistic infections. The most appropriate medication regimen in this situation is one that provides prophylaxis against common opportunistic infections.

Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (option A) is the preferred prophylactic regimen for patients with HIV infection and CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts below 200/mm3. It provides protection against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with severe immunosuppression.

Azithromycin and itraconazole (option B) and azithromycin and amphotericin B (option C) are not the recommended prophylactic regimens for patients with severe immunosuppression. Azithromycin is used for prophylaxis against Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, but it is not the first-line choice in this case. Itraconazole and amphotericin B are antifungal medications, but they are not indicated for prophylaxis in this situation.

Dapsone, pyrimethamine, itraconazole, azithromycin (option E) is not the recommended prophylactic regimen for patients with severe immunosuppression. Dapsone and pyrimethamine are used for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) and toxoplasmosis, respectively, but itraconazole and azithromycin are not the first-line choices in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate medication regimen for this patient is trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and azithromycin (option D), which provides prophylaxis against PCP and MAC infections.",
"A 32-year-old male presents to the emergency department because of fever and diarrhea. He was in his normal state of health until 2 weeks ago when he went abroad on a vacation. During his trip he went kayaking, visited spas, interacted with local animals, and ate local foods. Since returning he has had 3-day history of fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea. He drinks socially and has a 15-pack-year history of smoking. On presentation his temperature is 102.3°F (39.1°C), blood pressure is 105/62 mmHg, pulse is 91/min, respirations are 18/min, and O2 saturation is 91% on room air. Chest exam reveals fine crackles on auscultation. Chest radiograph reveals patchy infiltrates in both lungs and labs reveal mild hyponatremia and mild elevation of AST/ALT levels. The organism that is most likely responsible for this patient's symptoms is associated with which of the following characteristics?
Options:
(A): Can form an endospore
(B): Has a rabbit reservoir
(C): Has no cell wall
(D): Is more common in parrot owners
(E): Is transmitted by air conditioning
",Is transmitted by air conditioning,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Is transmitted by air conditioning.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely organism responsible for his symptoms is Legionella pneumophila, which is transmitted by air conditioning. Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause a severe form of pneumonia known as Legionnaires' disease. It is commonly associated with contaminated water sources, such as hot tubs, cooling towers, and air conditioning systems. 

The patient's history of visiting spas and interacting with local animals may have exposed him to the bacteria. The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include fever, cough, headache, and diarrhea, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. The chest exam findings of fine crackles and the chest radiograph showing patchy infiltrates in both lungs are also consistent with Legionnaires' disease.

The other options are not associated with Legionella pneumophila. Option (A) is incorrect because Legionella pneumophila does not form endospores. Option (B) is incorrect because Legionella pneumophila does not have a rabbit reservoir. Option (C) is incorrect because Legionella pneumophila does have a cell wall. Option (D) is incorrect because Legionella pneumophila is not more common in parrot owners.",
"A 14-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with hand pain after falling from his skateboard one day ago. He reports that he lost his balance while attempting a new trick and fell on his outstretched hands. He has been icing his hand and taking several tablets of ibuprofen every few hours, but the pain and swelling have not improved. The patient reports that he has not been able to use the hand to take notes in school. His past medical history is significant for infectious mononucleosis last year and type 1 diabetes mellitus for which he has an insulin pump. On physical exam, there is mild swelling over the dorsal aspect of the hand and wrist. He has tenderness in the region between the extensor pollicus longus and the extensor pollicus brevis of the right hand.

Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): Reassurance and pain management
(B): Radiograph of the wrist
(C): MRI of the wrist
(D): Thumb spica cast
(E): Radial gutter cast
",Radiograph of the wrist,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Radiograph of the wrist.

Explanation:
In this case, the patient presents with hand pain and swelling after a fall on his outstretched hands. He has tenderness in the region between the extensor pollicus longus and the extensor pollicus brevis of the right hand. These findings are concerning for a possible fracture or ligamentous injury. 

The best next step in management is to obtain a radiograph of the wrist. Radiographs are the initial imaging modality of choice for evaluating acute wrist injuries. They can help identify fractures, dislocations, and other bony abnormalities. In this case, a radiograph of the wrist will help determine if there is a fracture or ligamentous injury that requires further intervention, such as casting or surgical management.

Reassurance and pain management (option A) may be appropriate for minor injuries or soft tissue injuries, but given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, further evaluation with a radiograph is warranted.

MRI of the wrist (option C) is not the best next step in management for an acute wrist injury. MRI is typically reserved for cases where there is suspicion for soft tissue injuries, such as ligament tears or tendon injuries, that may not be visible on radiographs. It is not the initial imaging modality of choice for acute wrist injuries.

Thumb spica cast (option D) and radial gutter cast (option E) may be appropriate treatments depending on the specific diagnosis, but the first step is to obtain a radiograph to determine the extent of the injury and guide further management.

Therefore, the best next step in management for this patient is to obtain a radiograph of the wrist.",
"A 22-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 45- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 15 years. Her last menstrual period was 5 weeks ago. The patient reports that she was too embarrassed to discuss this issue with anyone until now. Over the past two years, she was unable to become pregnant despite having unprotected sexual intercourse with her husband on a regular basis. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lb); BMI is 29.4 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe facial acne. There is abnormal pigmented hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. The patient wishes to have children. In addition to recommending lifestyle modifications, which of the following is the most appropriate step in management?
Options:
(A): In vitro fertilization with patient's egg
(B): Progesterone therapy
(C): Bromocriptine therapy
(D): Clomiphene therapy
(E): Leuprolide therapy
",Clomiphene therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Clomiphene therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she likely has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, signs of androgen excess (such as oily skin, severe facial acne, and abnormal pigmented hair), and often infertility. The patient's history of irregular menstrual bleeding, difficulty becoming pregnant despite regular unprotected intercourse, and physical examination findings are consistent with PCOS.

Clomiphene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that is commonly used as a first-line treatment for infertility in women with PCOS. It works by blocking the negative feedback of estrogen on the hypothalamus, leading to increased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). This stimulates the development and maturation of ovarian follicles, increasing the chances of ovulation and pregnancy.

In vitro fertilization (IVF) with the patient's own eggs (option A) may be considered if clomiphene therapy is unsuccessful or if there are other factors contributing to infertility. However, it is not the most appropriate initial step in management.

Progesterone therapy (option B) is not indicated in this patient. Progesterone is typically used to induce withdrawal bleeding in women with amenorrhea due to anovulation. This patient has irregular menstrual bleeding, suggesting anovulatory cycles, but progesterone therapy alone is unlikely to address the underlying hormonal imbalance in PCOS.

Bromocriptine therapy (option C) is used to treat hyperprolactinemia, which can cause menstrual irregularities and infertility. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with PCOS than hyperprolactinemia.

Leuprolide therapy (option E) is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist that suppresses the release of FSH and LH, leading to a hypoestrogenic state. It is sometimes used in the management of PCOS, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this patient.

Therefore, the most appropriate step in management for this patient with PCOS and infertility is clomiphene therapy (option D).",
"A 56-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of nausea and shortness of breath that started while he was at work one hour ago. He also reports lightheadedness that started earlier in the day. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes metformin and sitagliptin. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He appears pale and diaphoretic. A 12-lead ECG is shown. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Viral myocarditis
(B): Acute pericarditis
(C): Acute inferior myocardial infarction
(D): Saddle pulmonary embolus
(E): Second-degree AV block
",Acute inferior myocardial infarction,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Acute inferior myocardial infarction.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of nausea, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, and diaphoresis, along with the ECG findings, the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms is an acute inferior myocardial infarction.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with cardiac ischemia, which can occur due to a blockage in the coronary arteries. The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF, which are characteristic findings of an inferior myocardial infarction. This indicates that the blood supply to the inferior wall of the heart is compromised.

The patient's risk factors, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and smoking, further increase the likelihood of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.

Viral myocarditis (A) is less likely in this case because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with acute coronary syndrome rather than an infectious process.

Acute pericarditis (B) typically presents with chest pain that is sharp and pleuritic in nature, and is not associated with the symptoms of nausea, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness seen in this patient.

Saddle pulmonary embolus (D) would present with symptoms such as sudden onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis. The ECG findings in this patient are not consistent with pulmonary embolism.

Second-degree AV block (E) would present with a characteristic pattern of intermittent dropped beats on the ECG, which is not seen in this patient.",
"A 27-year-old man with a history of cocaine abuse comes to the physician 2 weeks after undergoing successful arthroscopic repair of a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. There were no complications. He was discharged with prescriptions for oxycodone and acetaminophen. He complains of severe pain that prevents him from participating in physical therapy and wakes him from sleep. Physical examination of the left knee shows a healing incision; there is no joint effusion, erythema, or evidence of wound dehiscence, and his gait is normal. When the physician recommends switching to ibuprofen for pain, he becomes visibly angry and demands a refill of oxycodone. Which of the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?
Options:
(A): Prescribe a long-acting opioid for better pain relief if he is willing to sign a pain contract
(B): Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past
(C): Request consent for urine test to assess current drug use
(D): Prescribe a short course of oxycodone and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week
(E): Refer to a substance use counselor for addiction counseling
",Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Request further information about which drugs he has taken recently and in the past.

Explanation:
Given the patient's history of cocaine abuse, it is important to gather more information about his recent and past drug use. This will help determine if his severe pain is due to inadequate pain control or if there are other factors contributing to his pain. It is possible that his pain is not solely related to the surgical procedure and may be influenced by his substance abuse history. By requesting further information about his drug use, the physician can better assess the appropriateness of continuing opioid therapy and explore alternative pain management strategies if necessary. This approach is in line with current guidelines that recommend non-opioid therapy as first-line treatment for acute and subacute pain, and the cautious use of opioids when necessary, especially in patients with a history of substance abuse.",
"An 89-year-old woman sees her neurologist for a follow-up evaluation. Three months ago, she presented with complaints about facial asymmetry. Her daughter has noticed that her mother’s mouth is droops downwards on the right side of her face and that she cannot close her right eye well. The same side also lacks wrinkles on the forehead. Since then, the patient feels like her facial muscles have gotten weaker. She was given a course of corticosteroids, but she has still not recovered fully. Upon being asked to close her eyes, the patient has difficulty doing so and fails to completely close her eyelids. On examination, there is no loss of pain, temperature, or crude or tactile touch sensations in the whole face. The neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable. This patient also has type 2 diabetes mellitus which is well controlled with metformin. The neurologist recommends a therapy that will help relieve her symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely treatment option being prescribed to this patient?
Options:
(A): Botox
(B): Carbamazepine
(C): Vitamin B12
(D): Methylprednisolone
(E): Ceftriaxone
",Botox,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Botox.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, she is most likely experiencing facial weakness due to facial nerve palsy, also known as Bell's palsy. Bell's palsy is characterized by sudden weakness or paralysis of the muscles on one side of the face, resulting in facial asymmetry. The inability to close the eye completely and drooping of the mouth are classic signs of facial nerve involvement.

The lack of wrinkles on the forehead on the affected side is due to the loss of innervation to the frontalis muscle, which is responsible for forehead wrinkling. The absence of other neurological deficits and the patient's well-controlled diabetes suggest that the facial nerve palsy is likely idiopathic (unknown cause) rather than due to a systemic infection or other underlying condition.

Botox (botulinum toxin) is a treatment option for facial nerve palsy. It works by temporarily paralyzing the muscles on the unaffected side of the face, allowing the affected side to regain symmetry. By weakening the overactive muscles on the unaffected side, Botox helps to restore balance and improve facial symmetry. It is a safe and effective treatment option for patients with persistent facial weakness due to Bell's palsy.

Carbamazepine (B) is an anticonvulsant medication that is commonly used to treat trigeminal neuralgia, a condition characterized by severe facial pain. It is not indicated for the treatment of facial nerve palsy.

Vitamin B12 (C) deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, but it is not the most likely cause of the patient's facial weakness in this case. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with facial nerve palsy rather than a vitamin deficiency.

Methylprednisolone (D) is a corticosteroid medication that was already given to the patient but did not result in full recovery. While corticosteroids are commonly used in the treatment of Bell's palsy, the patient's lack of complete recovery suggests that an alternative treatment option may be necessary.

Ceftriaxone (E) is an antibiotic that is commonly used to treat bacterial infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of facial nerve palsy, which is likely idiopathic in this case.",
"A 28-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of a 3-day history of fever, chills, and generalized weakness. He has no cough. He was treated for a neck abscess 6 months ago. He takes no medications. He has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years and drinks two to three beers daily. He has been using intravenous cocaine and heroin for 6 years. He appears ill. His temperature is 38.6°C (101.5°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are retinal hemorrhages with pale centers. The lungs are clear to auscultation. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the lower left sternal border. Laboratory studies show:
Hemoglobin 13.3 g/dL
Leukocyte count 14,300/mm3
Platelet count 278,000/mm3

Transthoracic echocardiography shows multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two sets of blood cultures are collected. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?""
Options:
(A): Transesophageal echocardiography
(B): Intravenous vancomycin therapy
(C): X-ray of the chest
(D): CT pulmonary angiogram
(E): Intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy
""
",Intravenous vancomycin therapy,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Intravenous vancomycin therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, along with the presence of multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve seen on transthoracic echocardiography, the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis. The patient's history of intravenous drug use, along with the presence of track marks and the grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, further supports this diagnosis.

Intravenous vancomycin therapy is the most appropriate next step in management for infective endocarditis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which is commonly associated with intravenous drug use. Vancomycin is the drug of choice for MRSA infections, including infective endocarditis. It has excellent activity against MRSA and is effective in treating infections caused by this organism.

Transesophageal echocardiography (option A) is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating the extent of valvular involvement and detecting complications of infective endocarditis. However, in this case, transthoracic echocardiography has already shown multiple vegetations on the tricuspid valve, which is sufficient to establish the diagnosis.

X-ray of the chest (option C) and CT pulmonary angiogram (option D) are not indicated in this patient. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with infective endocarditis, and the presence of retinal hemorrhages suggests embolic phenomena. Therefore, the focus of management should be on treating the underlying infection rather than investigating the lungs.

Intravenous ciprofloxacin therapy (option E) is not the most appropriate choice for the treatment of infective endocarditis caused by MRSA. Ciprofloxacin is not effective against MRSA and is not recommended as monotherapy for this condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is intravenous vancomycin therapy.",
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent fatigue for the past 4 months. She has no history of major medical illness. Her temperature is 36°C (96.8°F), pulse is 121/min, and blood pressure is 120/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows pale conjunctivae. A peripheral blood smear is shown. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Hereditary spherocytosis
(B): Vitamin B12 deficiency
(C): Pyruvate kinase deficiency
(D): Iron deficiency
(E): β-thalassemia minor
",Iron deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Iron deficiency.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of persistent fatigue, pale conjunctivae, and a peripheral blood smear showing microcytic hypochromic red blood cells are consistent with iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia worldwide and is characterized by a decrease in the production of hemoglobin, resulting in smaller and paler red blood cells. The symptoms of iron deficiency anemia include fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and decreased exercise tolerance. The patient's normal temperature, pulse, and blood pressure are not specific to any particular cause of anemia. Hereditary spherocytosis is a genetic disorder characterized by spherical-shaped red blood cells and is not associated with iron deficiency. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause megaloblastic anemia, which is characterized by large red blood cells, and is not consistent with the patient's peripheral blood smear findings. Pyruvate kinase deficiency and β-thalassemia minor are both types of hemolytic anemias, which are characterized by the destruction of red blood cells, and would not present with microcytic hypochromic red blood cells on peripheral blood smear.",
"A 40-year old man presents to the clinic with vague upper abdominal pain that has been worsening for the last several days. He says that he often gets similar pain but less severe and that it worsens with meals. The pain sometimes radiates to his back. He recently lost 15 kg (33.6 lb) of weight secondary to his lack of appetite since his last visit 2 months ago. He admits to drinking alcohol almost every night since the age of 17. His temperature is 37.0° C (98.6°F), respirations are 15/min, pulse is 67/min, and blood pressure is 122/98 mm Hg. Physical examination reveals moderate epigastric tenderness. An abdominal CT scan reveals calcifications as shown by the white arrows. Which of the following organs is affected in this patient?
Options:
(A): Pancreas
(B): Jejunum
(C): Duodenum
(D): Large intestine
(E): Gall bladder
",Pancreas,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Pancreas.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including vague upper abdominal pain that worsens with meals and radiates to the back, along with weight loss and a history of alcohol abuse, are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis. The presence of calcifications on the abdominal CT scan further supports this diagnosis. Chronic pancreatitis is commonly caused by long-term alcohol abuse, which leads to inflammation and fibrosis of the pancreas. This can result in the destruction of pancreatic tissue and the development of calcifications. The other options, including the jejunum, duodenum, large intestine, and gall bladder, are not typically associated with the symptoms and findings described in this patient.",
"A 36-year-old man presents to his physician for a regular checkup, and he expresses an intent to quit smoking. He is a financial director with a 15-pack-year history of smoking who tried quitting several times. He tried different nicotine replacement products, none of which helped him. The patient has gastrointestinal reflux disease and takes omeprazole. The medical history is significant for a head trauma after which he had two seizure episodes. He does not have a history of any other disorders. Currently, he is not on any antiepileptic medication. He heard from his friend about an antidepressant that efficiently helps with smoking cessation. He would like to try this medication, and asks his physician for an advice. Which of the following statements regarding the use of the mentioned medication is correct?
Options:
(A): Omeprazole interferes with bupropion metabolism and should be taken one hour prior to omeprazole consumption.
(B): Bupropion is only effective when used together with nicotine replacement products.
(C): Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.
(D): The physician may prescribe bupropion for this patient only after a full cardiac workup is performed.
(E): This patient has no contraindications for bupropion and may safely use it.
",Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold and it should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder.

Explanation:
Bupropion is an antidepressant that is commonly used for smoking cessation. However, it lowers the seizure threshold and should not be taken by patients with a history of seizure disorder. In this case, the patient has a history of two seizure episodes after a head trauma, making bupropion contraindicated for him. It is important to consider the patient's medical history and contraindications before prescribing any medication.",
"A 32-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 0, at 22 weeks' gestation comes to the emergency department for abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding for 2 hours. She has had no prenatal care. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 138/82 mm Hg. The abdomen is nontender, and regular contractions are felt every 2 minutes. The uterus is consistent in size with a 20-week gestation. There is blood on the vulva, introitus, and medial aspect of the thighs. Ultrasound shows complete detachment of the placenta from the uterus. Fetal heart tones are absent. An emergent cesarean delivery is performed. Following the procedure, the patient becomes tearful and distraught. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial response by the physician?
Options:
(A): “I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.”
(B): “Losing a baby is difficult, but I'm sure next time it'll work out.”
(C): “I'm sorry for your loss. Let's talk about how to move forward from here.”
(D): “Losing a baby is difficult; but I see this every day, and I know you'll get through it.”
(E): “I'm sorry for your loss. I can write you a prescription to help with your anxiety and grief.”
",“I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.”,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) “I'm sorry for your loss. This must be a difficult situation for you.”

Explanation:
This response shows empathy and acknowledges the patient's feelings of loss and distress. It is important for the physician to express sympathy and understanding in this situation. The patient has just experienced a traumatic event with the loss of her baby, and it is crucial to provide emotional support and validate her emotions. The physician should create a safe space for the patient to express her feelings and offer appropriate resources for grief counseling if needed. The other options either minimize the patient's feelings, blame her for not receiving prenatal care, or offer medication without addressing her emotional needs.",
"A 78-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue and headache for 6 months and occasional abdominal pain. He has not had any changes in his weight. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic shoulder pain. Current daily medications include hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, and ibuprofen. He does not drink alcohol and does not smoke. His diet has mostly consisted of potatoes and lean meats since his wife passed away 1 year ago. His pulse is 92/min and blood pressure is 135/80 mm Hg. Examination shows conjunctival and mucosal pallor. Abdominal and rectal examination shows no abnormalities. Neurological exam shows mild postural tremor. Peripheral blood smear shows red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Folic acid deficiency
(B): Intravascular hemolysis
(C): Impaired erythropoietin production
(D): Vitamin B12 deficiency
(E): Iron deficiency
",Iron deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Iron deficiency.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fatigue, headache, and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of conjunctival and mucosal pallor, suggest anemia. The peripheral blood smear findings of red blood cells with increased zones of central pallor and anisocytosis are consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia worldwide. In this patient, the history of a diet consisting mostly of potatoes and lean meats suggests a lack of iron-rich foods. Additionally, the patient's age and gender put him at increased risk for iron deficiency. The chronic shoulder pain may be a result of musculoskeletal symptoms associated with iron deficiency anemia.

Folic acid deficiency (choice A) can cause megaloblastic anemia, but the peripheral blood smear findings in this patient are not consistent with megaloblastic anemia.

Intravascular hemolysis (choice B) would typically present with signs of hemolysis such as jaundice and dark urine, which are not present in this patient.

Impaired erythropoietin production (choice C) would result in a normocytic anemia, not the microcytic anemia seen in this patient.

Vitamin B12 deficiency (choice D) can cause megaloblastic anemia, but the peripheral blood smear findings in this patient are not consistent with megaloblastic anemia. Additionally, the patient's diet does not suggest a lack of vitamin B12 intake.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms is iron deficiency.",
"A 35-year-old woman comes to the physician for genetic counseling prior to conception. Her younger brother has mild developmental delay, pale complexion, and has to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. She has no similar symptoms and is in good health. Her parents are healthy. Which of the following is the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother?
Options:
(A): 67%
(B): 33%
(C): 100%
(D): 75%
(E): 50%
",67%,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) 67%.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the woman's younger brother has a disease that requires him to limit his dietary intake of phenylalanine. This suggests that he may have phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder. In autosomal recessive disorders, both parents must be carriers of the disease-causing gene in order for their children to be affected.

Since the woman's parents are healthy and she does not have any symptoms of the disease, it is likely that she is a carrier of the disease-causing gene. The chance of being a carrier for an autosomal recessive disorder when one sibling is affected is 2/3 or approximately 67%.

Therefore, the most appropriate assessment of her carrier status for the disease affecting her brother is 67%.",
"A 23-year-old man presents with swelling of the left knee. He noticed the swelling a day ago while preparing for the college basketball game. He has had approximately 10 different sexual partners in the past 3 months. Synovial fluid tap shows a WBC count of 90,000 cells/mm3. What is the mechanism of action of the drug which is indicated for the treatment of this patient’s most likely condition?
Options:
(A): Metabolic inhibitor
(B): Cell wall inhibitor
(C): Neutrophil migration inhibitor
(D): Prostaglandin inhibitor
(E): Uric acid synthesis inhibitor
",Cell wall inhibitor,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Cell wall inhibitor.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of swelling in the knee and a high white blood cell count in the synovial fluid, the most likely condition is septic arthritis. Septic arthritis is an infection of the joint, commonly caused by bacteria. The high white blood cell count indicates an inflammatory response to the infection.

The mechanism of action of the drug indicated for the treatment of septic arthritis is a cell wall inhibitor. Cell wall inhibitors, such as antibiotics like penicillin or cephalosporins, work by disrupting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. This weakens the bacteria and makes them more susceptible to the immune system and other antibiotics.

By inhibiting the synthesis of the bacterial cell wall, the drug helps to kill the bacteria causing the infection and reduce the inflammation in the joint. This can help alleviate the symptoms and prevent further damage to the joint.

The other options are not indicated for the treatment of septic arthritis:
(A) Metabolic inhibitors are not specific to bacterial infections and would not target the bacteria causing the septic arthritis.
(C) Neutrophil migration inhibitors would prevent the migration of neutrophils, which are important immune cells involved in fighting infections. In septic arthritis, it is important to have an immune response to clear the infection, so inhibiting neutrophil migration would not be beneficial.
(D) Prostaglandin inhibitors, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can help reduce pain and inflammation, but they do not directly target the bacteria causing the infection.
(E) Uric acid synthesis inhibitors are used to treat conditions like gout, which is caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. This is not the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms in this case.",
"Which of the following patient presentations seen in a pediatric immunology clinic is most consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia?
Options:
(A): A 15-month-old girl who has had repeated otitis media, pneumonia, and progressive clumsiness since beginning to walk in the past three months
(B): A 10-month-old boy who has had recurrent viral infections as well as hypocalcemia during neonatal period
(C): A 4-year-old girl who has had repeated oral candidasis in the past nine months
(D): A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months
(E): A 7-month-old boy who has had recurrent pneumococcal pneumonia, eczema, and easy bruising in the past four months
",A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): A 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.

Explanation:
Bruton's agammaglobulinemia, also known as X-linked agammaglobulinemia, is a primary humoral immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent bacterial infections of the respiratory tract and increased susceptibility to enteroviral infection. The most common clinical symptoms of this condition are recurrent otitis media and pneumonia. 

Option (A) is not consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia because progressive clumsiness is not a typical symptom of this condition.

Option (B) is not consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia because hypocalcemia during the neonatal period is not a characteristic feature of this condition.

Option (C) is not consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia because repeated oral candidiasis is not a typical symptom of this condition.

Option (E) is not consistent with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia because eczema and easy bruising are not characteristic features of this condition.

Therefore, the most consistent presentation with a diagnosis of Bruton's agammaglobulinemia is a 9-month-old boy who has had recurrent otitis media and pneumococcal pneumonia in the past three months.",
"A 29-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by a concerned neighbor. The patient appears disheveled, has a flat affect, and appears to be having auditory hallucinations. He is alert and oriented to time, person, and place and has an intact long-term and short-term memory. His neighbor says that he never really knew the patient that well and that he mostly kept to himself. They have been neighbors for the past 3 years at an apartment close to the hospital. What worried the neighbor was a sudden change in the patient's behavior which started last week. He suddenly seemed interested in attending all the local council meetings and social gatherings. He is very talkative at these events and boasts highly of himself and starts suggesting changes that the committee could make with his help. He gets very agitated when they deny accepting his suggestions. Which of the following is a predictor of good prognosis for this patient's condition?
Options:
(A): Affective symptoms
(B): Slow onset
(C): Being single
(D): Male sex
(E): Negative symptoms
",Affective symptoms,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Affective symptoms.

Explanation:
In the given scenario, the patient is exhibiting symptoms of psychosis, including disheveled appearance, flat affect, auditory hallucinations, and a sudden change in behavior. These symptoms are suggestive of a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia.

Affective symptoms refer to symptoms related to mood and emotions. In the context of schizophrenia, affective symptoms include symptoms of depression or mania. Research has shown that the presence of affective symptoms in schizophrenia is associated with a better prognosis.

On the other hand, negative symptoms, such as apathy and social withdrawal, are associated with a poorer prognosis in schizophrenia. Negative symptoms are characterized by a loss or decrease in normal functioning and can significantly impact a person's ability to engage in daily activities and maintain relationships.

Therefore, in this case, the presence of affective symptoms suggests a better prognosis for the patient's condition. It indicates that the positive (psychotic) symptoms of the disorder can potentially be controlled with medication, allowing for higher functioning and better overall outcomes.",
"A 23-year-old man comes to the clinic for yellowing of his eyes. The patient has been relatively healthy and just recently started “intermittent fasting” to try to lose weight. He recalls a similar episode 4 years ago when he was recovering from an emergency appendectomy. The patient denies smoking but endorses an episode of binge drinking 2 days ago. He is sexually active with both men and women. His physical examination is unremarkable besides scleral icterus. What is the most likely explanation for this patient’s symptoms?
Options:
(A): Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of biliary tract
(B): Chronic viral infection of the liver
(C): Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase
(D): Defective bilirubin excretion
(E): Macrovesicular steatosis
",Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of yellowing of the eyes (scleral icterus) are indicative of jaundice, which is caused by an accumulation of bilirubin in the body. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is produced when red blood cells are broken down. It is normally processed by the liver and excreted in the bile.

In this case, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. UDP-glucuronosyltransferase is an enzyme responsible for conjugating bilirubin with glucuronic acid, which makes it water-soluble and allows for its excretion in the bile. Decreased activity of this enzyme can result in impaired bilirubin conjugation and excretion, leading to the accumulation of unconjugated bilirubin in the body.

The patient's history of intermittent fasting, previous episode of jaundice after an appendectomy, and recent binge drinking are all risk factors for the development of Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome is a common inherited disorder characterized by decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. It is typically benign and does not require treatment, but can result in intermittent episodes of jaundice, especially during times of stress or fasting.

Autoimmune-mediated fibrosis of the biliary tract (option A) is unlikely in this case as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis.

Chronic viral infection of the liver (option B) is also unlikely as the patient does not have any risk factors for viral hepatitis and his symptoms are not consistent with chronic liver disease.

Defective bilirubin excretion (option D) is a possible cause of jaundice, but the most likely underlying mechanism in this case is decreased activity of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase.

Macrovesicular steatosis (option E) refers to the accumulation of fat droplets in liver cells and is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.",
"A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-month history of increasingly frequent episodes of vertigo and feeling unsteady while walking. She reports that she has had episodic tinnitus in her right ear for the past 3 years. Neurologic examination shows hearing loss in the right ear. An MRI of the brain is shown. Pathologic examination of this patient's lesion is most likely to show which of the following?
Options:
(A): Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification
(B): Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil
(C): Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma
(D): Pleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas forming pseudopalisades
(E): Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nucleus resembling a fried egg
",Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Hypercellular areas of spindle cells and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms of vertigo, feeling unsteady while walking, and episodic tinnitus in the right ear, along with the finding of hearing loss in the right ear on neurologic examination, the most likely diagnosis is vestibular schwannoma, also known as an acoustic neuroma.

Vestibular schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from the Schwann cells of the vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII). They typically present with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. The hearing loss is usually gradual and progressive, and patients may also experience imbalance and unsteadiness while walking.

Pathologic examination of vestibular schwannomas typically shows hypercellular areas of spindle cells, which represent the proliferating Schwann cells, and hypocellular areas of myxoid stroma. This characteristic histologic pattern helps differentiate vestibular schwannomas from other types of brain tumors.

Whorls of densely packed cells with areas of lamellated calcification are seen in meningiomas, which are typically extra-axial tumors that arise from the meninges.

Small blue cells arranged in rosettes around a central neuropil are seen in medulloblastomas, which are malignant embryonal tumors that arise in the cerebellum.

Pleomorphic cells clustered around necrotic areas forming pseudopalisades are seen in glioblastomas, which are aggressive malignant tumors that arise from astrocytes.

Cells with clear cytoplasm and central round nucleus resembling a fried egg are seen in oligodendrogliomas, which are slow-growing tumors that arise from oligodendrocytes.",
"A 47-year-old female presents to her primary physician for follow up after an ED visit for nephrolithiasis 1 week prior. CT scan in the ED revealed a 4-mm stone occluding the right ureter. She was able to pass the stone without assistance over the course of 5 hours. Pathology report on the stone states it was composed of calcium oxalate. She says that the pain of passing the stone was excruciating and asks how she can prevent kidney stones in the future. Which of the following interventions is most likely to prevent renal calculi formation in the future for this patient?
Options:
(A): Decreasing calcium intake
(B): Decreasing sodium intake
(C): Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds
(D): Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy
(E): Urine acidification with cranberry juice
",Decreasing sodium intake,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Decreasing sodium intake.

Explanation:
To prevent renal calculi formation in the future, the patient should focus on decreasing sodium intake. This is because excess sodium intake can increase the excretion of calcium in the urine, leading to the formation of calcium stones. By reducing sodium intake, the patient can decrease the amount of calcium excreted in the urine and lower the risk of stone formation.

Decreasing calcium intake (option A) is not recommended as a preventive measure for calcium oxalate stones. In fact, low-calcium diets may paradoxically increase the risk of stone formation by increasing oxalate absorption and subsequent hyperoxaluria.

Increasing consumption of nuts and seeds (option C) is not a specific intervention for preventing renal calculi formation. While nuts and seeds can be part of a healthy diet, there is no evidence to suggest that increasing their consumption alone will prevent the formation of kidney stones.

Loop diuretic pharmacotherapy (option D) is not the first-line treatment for preventing renal calculi formation. Loop diuretics are primarily used to treat conditions such as edema and hypertension, and their use in preventing kidney stones is not supported by strong evidence.

Urine acidification with cranberry juice (option E) is not an effective intervention for preventing renal calculi formation. Cranberry juice is commonly used for urinary tract infections, but it does not have a significant impact on the prevention of kidney stones. The focus should be on reducing sodium intake instead.",
"A 62-year-old man comes to the physician because of worsening involuntary movements of both arms for the past 7 months. He reports that certain daily activities have become more difficult to perform. His father had a similar condition that was treated with medications. The patient appears anxious. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows a low-amplitude tremor bilaterally when the arms are outstretched that worsens when reaching out to grab a pen. Muscle strength and tone is normal bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. On mental status examination, his mood is good. His speech is normal in rate and rhythm. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Deep brain stimulation
(B): Thalamotomy
(C): Levodopa and carbidopa therapy
(D): Clonazepam therapy
(E): Propranolol therapy
",Propranolol therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Propranolol therapy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of worsening involuntary movements of both arms, low-amplitude tremor that worsens with specific activities, and normal muscle strength and tone, the most likely diagnosis is essential tremor. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder characterized by bilateral, symmetric, postural or kinetic tremor that typically affects the hands and arms. It can worsen with specific activities such as reaching out to grab a pen. 

The first-line treatment for essential tremor is pharmacotherapy with propranolol or primidone. Propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocker, is the preferred initial treatment option. It has been shown to be effective in reducing tremor severity in essential tremor. Primidone, an anticonvulsant, is an alternative first-line treatment option. 

Deep brain stimulation (A) and thalamotomy (B) are surgical options that are considered in patients with severe and refractory essential tremor who do not respond to or cannot tolerate pharmacotherapy. These options are not appropriate as the initial step in management for this patient.

Levodopa and carbidopa therapy (C) is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, not essential tremor. This patient's presentation is not consistent with Parkinson's disease.

Clonazepam therapy (D) is used in the treatment of myoclonus and some forms of dystonia, but it is not the first-line treatment for essential tremor.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient with essential tremor is propranolol therapy (E).",
"Ten days after undergoing a cadaveric renal transplant, a 21-year-old man has pain in the right lower abdomen and generalized fatigue. During the past 2 days, he has had decreasing urinary output. He passed 5 liters of urine on the second postoperative day and serum studies showed a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL. He has adult polycystic kidney disease and was on maintenance hemodialysis for 2 months prior to transplantation. Current medications include azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone, and enalapril. He appears lethargic. His temperature is 37.8°C (100°F), pulse is 101/min, and blood pressure is 164/94 mm Hg. Examination shows a healing surgical incision in the right lower abdomen. The graft site shows tenderness to palpation. His blood urea nitrogen concentration is 52 mg/dL, creatinine concentration is 4.1 mg/dL. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows tubulitis. C4d staining is negative. Which of the following is the most likely responsible for this patient's findings?
Options:
(A): Recipient T-cells in the graft
(B): Drug-induced nephrotoxicity
(C): Fibrosis of the glomerular vessels
(D): Polyomavirus-associated nephropathy
(E): Newly formed anti-HLA antibodies
""
",Recipient T-cells in the graft,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Recipient T-cells in the graft.

Explanation:
In this patient, the clinical presentation of pain in the right lower abdomen, generalized fatigue, decreasing urinary output, and elevated creatinine levels, along with the findings of tenderness at the graft site and tubulitis on biopsy, are consistent with acute cellular rejection of the transplanted kidney. Acute cellular rejection is the most common cause of allograft dysfunction in the first few months after transplantation. It is characterized by infiltration of the graft by recipient T-cells, which leads to tubulitis and interstitial inflammation. The presence of tubulitis on biopsy is a key finding in the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection. The patient's history of adult polycystic kidney disease and the absence of C4d staining on biopsy make other causes less likely. Drug-induced nephrotoxicity, fibrosis of the glomerular vessels, polyomavirus-associated nephropathy, and newly formed anti-HLA antibodies are not consistent with the clinical presentation and biopsy findings in this patient.",
"A 58-year-old woman presents to the office for routine follow-up. She recently underwent routine screening for bone density due to a history of hypothyroidism. She also has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is being treated with a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and more recently with a histamine2 receptor antagonist (H2RA), hypertension being treated with a thiazide diuretic, depression being treated with lithium, and hormone replacement therapy. Her results meet the criteria for osteopenia, with a T-score of -1.6. She is concerned about progressive bone loss and the risk of fractures. Which of the following medication classes should be discontinued?
Options:
(A): Proton-pump inhibitors
(B): Thiazide diuretics
(C): Histamine2 receptor antagonists
(D): Lithium
(E): Estrogen
",Proton-pump inhibitors,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Proton-pump inhibitors.

Explanation:
Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) should be discontinued in this patient. PPIs have been shown to reduce the fractional absorption of calcium carbonate in fasting postmenopausal women, which can contribute to bone loss. In patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis, it is important to optimize bone health and minimize factors that can contribute to bone loss. Discontinuing PPIs and considering alternative treatments for GERD, such as lifestyle modifications or other medications, can help reduce the risk of progressive bone loss and fractures in this patient.",
"A 46-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 15 minutes after being involved in a motor vehicle collision where he was the unrestrained driver. On arrival, he is unconscious. His respirations are 24/min, and palpable systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and pulse is 141/min and irregularly irregular. Examination shows multiple ecchymoses over the chest. There is a 3-cm (1.2-in) laceration over the abdomen and a 4-cm (1.6-in) laceration over the scalp. Jugular venous pressure is increased. Bilateral crackles are heard at the lung bases. Cardiac examination shows no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. The abdomen is soft. Two large bore intravenous catheters are inserted and 0.9% saline infusion is begun. Focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) is negative. An electrocardiogram shows absent p-waves. After 5 minutes, his pulse is 160/min and palpable systolic blood pressure is 50 mm Hg. Vasopressors are administered. One hour later, the patient dies. Which of the following was the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Cardiac contusion
(B): Hemothorax
(C): Aortic dissection
(D): Pulmonary contusion
(E): Cardiac tamponade
""
",Cardiac contusion,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Cardiac contusion.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario was involved in a motor vehicle collision and presents with multiple injuries, including ecchymoses over the chest, lacerations on the abdomen and scalp, and increased jugular venous pressure. These findings are suggestive of trauma to the chest and abdomen.

The patient's vital signs are concerning for shock, with a low systolic blood pressure and tachycardia. The absence of p-waves on the electrocardiogram suggests atrial fibrillation, which can be seen in patients with cardiac contusion.

Cardiac contusion occurs when there is direct trauma to the heart, typically from a blunt force injury. It can result in myocardial injury, arrhythmias, and cardiac dysfunction. The irregularly irregular pulse, increased jugular venous pressure, and subsequent deterioration in the patient's condition despite resuscitative efforts are consistent with cardiac contusion.

While other injuries such as hemothorax, aortic dissection, pulmonary contusion, and cardiac tamponade can also occur in trauma patients, the clinical findings in this case are most consistent with cardiac contusion.",
"A 65-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly-controlled hypertension and no recent illness or cardiac disease presents to clinic complaining of chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward. Vital signs are stable. On exam, you detect a friction rub. Routine labs show K 7.5 and Cr 5.1. If this patient's clinical signs and laboratory findings are indicative of a chronic condition, what would be expected on urinary analysis?
Options:
(A): Muddy brown granular casts
(B): Red blood cell casts
(C): White blood cell casts
(D): Fatty casts
(E): Broad and waxy casts
",Broad and waxy casts,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Broad and waxy casts.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation, including chest pain that is worse on inspiration and relieved by sitting forward, along with the presence of a friction rub, suggests pericarditis. The elevated potassium (K) and creatinine (Cr) levels indicate renal dysfunction, which can be seen in chronic conditions such as chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, the kidneys are unable to properly filter and excrete waste products, leading to electrolyte imbalances and elevated creatinine levels.

On urinary analysis, broad and waxy casts would be expected in a patient with CKD. Broad and waxy casts are formed in the renal tubules when there is chronic damage to the kidneys, resulting in dilated tubules and atrophy of the tubular epithelium. These casts are broad, colorless, and have a smooth appearance, resembling a waxy material.

Muddy brown granular casts (option A) are associated with acute tubular necrosis, which is not consistent with the chronic condition described in the question.

Red blood cell casts (option B) are seen in glomerulonephritis, which typically presents with hematuria and proteinuria, but is not consistent with the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient.

White blood cell casts (option C) are seen in pyelonephritis, which is an infection of the kidneys. This is not consistent with the chronic condition described in the question.

Fatty casts (option D) are seen in nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hyperlipidemia. This is not consistent with the clinical presentation and laboratory findings in this patient.",
"A 56-year-old man of Korean descent visits his primary care provider for an annual health check-up. His personal history is relevant for cigarette smoking and a sedentary lifestyle. He has type-2 diabetes mellitus which is under control with oral medications. Upon physical examination, he is found to have a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg, a pulse of 72/min, a respiratory rate of 18/min, and a body temperature of 36.5°C (97.7°F). The rest of the examination is unremarkable except for an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node. In addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy, which of the following tests should also be included in further assessment of this patient?
Options:
(A): Chest radiograph
(B): Upper gastointestinal endoscopy
(C): Computed tomography of head and neck
(D): Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain
(E): Ultrasound of the neck
",Upper gastointestinal endoscopy,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Explanation:
The presence of an enlarged, nontender left supraclavicular node in this patient raises concern for a possible malignancy, particularly gastric cancer. The left supraclavicular node is known as Virchow's node and is a sentinel node for metastasis from abdominal malignancies, including gastric cancer. Therefore, in addition to a fine needle aspiration or biopsy of the node, an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed to evaluate for the presence of gastric cancer. This is the most appropriate test to assess the patient's symptoms and findings. 

A chest radiograph (A) may be useful to evaluate for lung pathology, but it is not the most appropriate test in this case. 

A computed tomography (CT) of the head and neck (C) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (D) would not be indicated in the evaluation of an enlarged supraclavicular node. These tests are used to evaluate intracranial pathology, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms and findings. 

An ultrasound of the neck (E) may be useful to evaluate the supraclavicular node, but it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the node enlargement. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is the most appropriate test to evaluate for gastric cancer, which is a potential cause of the supraclavicular node enlargement in this patient.",
"A 46-year-old woman presents with a 5-month history of worsening dry cough, occasional shortness of breath, and fatigue. She says she is now having trouble walking a full block. For the past week, she also has noticed bilateral swelling of the lower legs. She denies chest pain, fever, chills, syncope, or bloody sputum. Current vitals include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse 63/min, blood pressure 128/91 mm Hg and respiratory rate 15/min. On physical examination, there is elevated jugular venous pressure, decreased breath sounds bilaterally at the lung bases, and 1+ non-pitting edema bilaterally in the lower extremities. A chest X-ray demonstrates a slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient?
Options:
(A): Bronchoalveolar wash
(B): Pulmonary function studies
(C): Echocardiography
(D): Chest CT
(E): Biopsy of the heart
",Echocardiography,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Echocardiography.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is heart failure. The patient has symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and lower extremity edema, as well as signs of elevated jugular venous pressure and decreased breath sounds at the lung bases. The slightly enlarged cardiac silhouette on chest X-ray is also consistent with heart failure.

Echocardiography is the most appropriate next step in the diagnosis of this patient because it can provide valuable information about the structure and function of the heart. It can help determine the underlying cause of heart failure, such as valvular disease or cardiomyopathy. Echocardiography can also assess the ejection fraction, which is an important measure of cardiac function.

Bronchoalveolar wash (A) is not indicated in this patient because the symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with heart failure rather than a primary respiratory condition.

Pulmonary function studies (B) may be helpful in evaluating respiratory symptoms, but they are not the most appropriate next step in this patient with suspected heart failure.

Chest CT (D) may be useful in certain cases, such as when there is suspicion for pulmonary embolism or lung cancer, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient with suspected heart failure.

Biopsy of the heart (E) is not necessary at this point in the evaluation. Echocardiography can provide valuable information about the structure and function of the heart without the need for an invasive procedure like a heart biopsy.",
"A 67-year-old woman with depression comes to the physician because of easy bruising and bleeding of her gums for the past 2 months. She has been living alone since the death of her husband 1 year ago. She appears thin and has temporal wasting bilaterally. Physical examination shows bruises on her lower legs, swollen gums, and petechiae on the hard palate. This patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of a substance that is composed primarily of which of the following amino acids?
Options:
(A): Glycine
(B): Proline
(C): Tyrosine
(D): Lysine
(E): Arginine
",Glycine,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Glycine.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of easy bruising, bleeding gums, and petechiae on the hard palate are suggestive of a bleeding disorder. The temporal wasting and thin appearance may indicate malnutrition. These findings, along with the patient's history of depression and living alone, are consistent with a diagnosis of scurvy.

Scurvy is a condition caused by a deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Vitamin C is necessary for the synthesis of collagen, a substance that provides strength and structure to blood vessels, skin, and other connective tissues. Collagen is composed primarily of the amino acids glycine, proline, and lysine.

In scurvy, the defective synthesis of collagen leads to weakened blood vessels, resulting in easy bruising and bleeding gums. The petechiae on the hard palate are a characteristic finding in scurvy.

Among the given options, glycine is the amino acid that is most abundant in collagen. Therefore, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to defective synthesis of collagen, which is composed primarily of glycine.",
"A 49-year-old female with a history of alcoholism was found lying unconscious on a bench at a local park and rushed to the emergency department. Upon arrival, the patient regained consciousness and complained of intense bilateral flank pain and a recent decrease in urination. Urine microscopy demonstrated abundant square crystals of calcium oxalate that looked like “folded envelopes."" Which of the following findings is most likely to be seen in this patient:
Options:
(A): Metabolic alkalosis
(B): Anion gap metabolic acidosis
(C): Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis
(D): Respiratory acidosis
(E): Respiratory alkalosis
",Anion gap metabolic acidosis,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Anion gap metabolic acidosis.

Explanation:
The patient's history of alcoholism, intense bilateral flank pain, recent decrease in urination, and the presence of square crystals of calcium oxalate in the urine are suggestive of ethylene glycol poisoning. Ethylene glycol is a toxic substance found in antifreeze and other household products. Ingestion of ethylene glycol can lead to the formation of calcium oxalate crystals in the urine, which can cause renal damage and acute kidney injury.

One of the key metabolic disturbances seen in ethylene glycol poisoning is anion gap metabolic acidosis. Ethylene glycol is metabolized in the liver to glycolic acid and oxalic acid, which are both strong acids. The accumulation of these acids in the blood leads to a decrease in pH and an increase in the anion gap. The anion gap is calculated by subtracting the sum of the measured serum concentrations of chloride and bicarbonate from the concentration of sodium. In ethylene glycol poisoning, the anion gap is typically elevated.

Metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis are not typically associated with ethylene glycol poisoning. Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis may be seen in conditions such as diarrhea or renal tubular acidosis, but it is not the most likely finding in this patient with a history of alcoholism and calcium oxalate crystals in the urine. Therefore, the most likely finding in this patient is anion gap metabolic acidosis.",
"A 53-year-old man comes to the physician for a follow-up appointment three days after being prescribed a selective alpha-1 agonist. He reports improvement in his symptoms and has not experienced any adverse effects. This drug was most likely prescribed for which of the following conditions?
Options:
(A): Bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma
(B): Bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology
(C): Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia
(D): Nasal congestion due to a viral infection
(E): Blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision
",Nasal congestion due to a viral infection,Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Nasal congestion due to a viral infection.

Explanation:
Selective alpha-1 agonists are commonly used to relieve nasal congestion due to a viral infection. These medications work by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal passages, reducing swelling and congestion. They are often available over-the-counter as nasal sprays or drops.

Option (A): Bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma
Selective alpha-1 agonists are not typically used to treat bronchospasm due to bronchial asthma. In asthma, bronchodilators such as beta-2 agonists are the preferred treatment to relax the smooth muscles of the airways and improve breathing.

Option (B): Bilateral hand tremors of indeterminate etiology
Selective alpha-1 agonists are not indicated for the treatment of hand tremors. Tremors can have various causes, and the treatment depends on the underlying condition. Medications such as beta blockers or anticonvulsants may be used for tremor management.

Option (C): Urinary hesitancy due to benign prostatic hyperplasia
Selective alpha-1 agonists are commonly used to treat urinary hesitancy and other urinary symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). These medications relax the smooth muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow. However, the question states that the patient is taking a selective alpha-1 agonist, not an alpha-1 blocker, which is the class of medication typically used for BPH.

Option (E): Blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision
Selective alpha-1 agonists are not used for blood pressure management prior to pheochromocytoma excision. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that can cause excessive release of catecholamines, leading to high blood pressure. Alpha-1 blockers, not agonists, are used to manage blood pressure in patients with pheochromocytoma before surgery. These medications block the effects of catecholamines on alpha-1 receptors, reducing blood pressure.",
"A 31-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department with fever, right upper quadrant pain, and myalgia. Her boyfriend says she recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. She appears ill and is lethargic. Her temperature is 39°C (102.2°F). Physical examination shows jaundice and tender hepatomegaly. Laboratory studies show the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies. A liver biopsy performed at this time would most likely show which of the following histopathological findings?
Options:
(A): Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei
(B): Acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages
(C): Cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris
(D): Basophilic adipocyte remnants, filled with calcifications
(E): Engorged hepatocytes with red blood cell infiltration
""
","Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei",Correct,"The correct answer is (A): Hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei.

Explanation:
The patient in this scenario presents with fever, right upper quadrant pain, myalgia, jaundice, and tender hepatomegaly. These clinical findings, along with the presence of anti-hepatitis A IgM antibodies, are consistent with acute hepatitis A infection.

Histopathological findings in acute hepatitis A typically show hepatocytes with shrunken, eosinophilic cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei. This is indicative of hepatocellular injury and apoptosis, which is a characteristic feature of acute viral hepatitis.

Option (B) is incorrect because acellular debris surrounded by lymphocytes and macrophages is more commonly seen in chronic hepatitis, not acute hepatitis A.

Option (C) is incorrect because cystic spaces with scattered areas of cellular debris are not characteristic findings of acute hepatitis A.

Option (D) is incorrect because basophilic adipocyte remnants filled with calcifications are not associated with acute hepatitis A.

Option (E) is incorrect because engorged hepatocytes with red blood cell infiltration are not typical findings in acute hepatitis A.",
"A 25-year-old man presents to his primary care physician for pain in his back. The patient describes the pain as feeling worse in the morning. He says it is a general stiffness that improves when he goes to the gym and lifts weights. He also states that his symptoms seem to improve when he leans forward or when he is cycling. The patient is a current smoker and is sexually active. He admits to having unprotected sex with many different partners this past year. The patient has no significant past medical history and is not currently taking any medications. On physical exam, the patient demonstrates notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions. The patient’s strength is 5/5 in his upper and lower extremities. The rest of his physical exam is within normal limits. Which of the following findings is associated with this patient’s presentation?
Options:
(A): Decreased levels of IgA
(B): Diminished pulses in the lower extremity
(C): Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright
(D): Pain with elevation of his leg while laying down
(E): Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed
",Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed,Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with ankylosing spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the axial skeleton, including the spine. AS typically presents with back pain and stiffness that is worse in the morning and improves with exercise. The patient's symptoms improving when he leans forward or cycles is also characteristic of AS.

The notable kyphosis of the thoracic spine and decreased mobility of the back in all 4 directions are also consistent with AS. AS can lead to fusion of the vertebrae, resulting in a loss of mobility.

The other options are not associated with AS:
(A) Decreased levels of IgA are seen in patients with selective IgA deficiency, which is not related to AS.
(B) Diminished pulses in the lower extremity may indicate peripheral arterial disease, which is not related to AS.
(C) Narrowing of the spinal canal when standing upright is seen in spinal stenosis, which is not related to AS.
(D) Pain with elevation of the leg while laying down is a symptom of sciatica, which is not related to AS.

Therefore, the correct answer is (E): Punctate bleeding spots when dermatologic scales are removed, which are known as Auspitz sign and are seen in psoriasis, a condition that can be associated with AS.",
"A 9-month-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his mother for a routine health checkup. The boy was born at 39 weeks gestation via spontaneous vaginal delivery. He is up to date on all vaccines and is meeting all developmental milestones. He was breastfed for the first 3 months and then switched to cow’s milk and about two months ago she started giving him fruits and vegetables. Family history is noncontributory. Today, his heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 40/min, blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg, and temperature of 37.0°C (98.6°F). On examination, he has a heartbeat with a regular rate and rhythm and his lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Generally, the boy looks pale. His weight and height fall within the expected range. A complete blood count (CBC) shows the following:
Hemoglobin (Hb): 9.1 g/dL
Mean corpuscular volume (MCV): 65 fL
Total iron binding capacity (TIBC): 550 μg/dL
Serum iron: 45 µg/dL
Serum lead: < 5 µg/dL
What is the best treatment for this patient?
Options:
(A): Iron supplementation only
(B): Proper diet and iron supplementation
(C): Multivitamins
(D): Proper diet only
(E): Lead chelation therapy
",Proper diet and iron supplementation,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Proper diet and iron supplementation.

Explanation:
The patient in this case is a 9-month-old boy who is presenting with symptoms of anemia, including pale appearance and low hemoglobin levels. The most likely cause of his anemia is iron deficiency, as evidenced by the low hemoglobin level and low serum iron level. Iron deficiency anemia is a common condition in infants and young children, especially those who have transitioned from breast milk to cow's milk, as cow's milk is low in iron.

The best treatment for iron deficiency anemia is a combination of proper diet and iron supplementation. Iron-rich foods, such as meat, poultry, fish, and fortified cereals, should be introduced into the child's diet. Additionally, iron supplementation should be given to ensure that the child is receiving an adequate amount of iron. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a daily iron supplement of 1 mg/kg/day for infants aged 6-12 months.

Multivitamins may contain iron, but they are not sufficient as the sole treatment for iron deficiency anemia. Lead chelation therapy is not indicated in this case, as the patient's serum lead level is within the normal range. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is proper diet and iron supplementation.",
"A 39-year-old woman, with a history of thyroidectomy and primary hyperparathyroidism presents for surgical evaluation for a right adrenal mass. Preoperatively, which of the following medications should she receive to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively?
Options:
(A): Atenolol
(B): Labetolol
(C): Lisinopril
(D): Nifedipine
(E): Phenoxybenzamine
",Phenoxybenzamine,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Phenoxybenzamine.

Explanation:
Phenoxybenzamine is an alpha-adrenergic antagonist that is commonly used preoperatively in patients with pheochromocytoma or other adrenal tumors to prevent a hypertensive crisis during surgery. In this case, the patient has a right adrenal mass, which raises suspicion for a possible pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors that can cause severe hypertension and cardiovascular instability during surgery if not properly managed.

Phenoxybenzamine works by irreversibly binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors, preventing the action of catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. By blocking the alpha-adrenergic receptors, phenoxybenzamine helps to control blood pressure and prevent hypertensive emergencies during surgery.

The other options listed (atenolol, labetolol, lisinopril, and nifedipine) are not appropriate choices for preventing a hypertensive emergency in this patient. Atenolol and labetolol are beta-blockers, which can be used to control blood pressure in some cases, but they do not specifically target the alpha-adrenergic receptors that are involved in the pathophysiology of pheochromocytoma. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, which is not effective in preventing the release of catecholamines from the adrenal tumor. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker, which can help to lower blood pressure, but it does not specifically target the alpha-adrenergic receptors involved in pheochromocytoma.

Therefore, phenoxybenzamine is the most appropriate choice in this case to prevent a hypertensive emergency intraoperatively.",
"A 58-year-old male is diagnosed with hypertension and started on daily propranolol after failing antihypertensive therapy with other medications. Three months later, his blood pressure appears to be adequately controlled on this therapy. While working in his garden one afternoon, the patient is stung by a wasp and experiences a severe anaphylactic reaction that is subsequently treated with epinephrine. Which of the following effects would be expected upon administration of this epinephrine treatment?
Options:
(A): Decreased bronchodilation
(B): Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract
(C): Decreased heart rate
(D): Decreased blood pressure
(E): Increased heart rate
",Decreased heart rate,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Decreased heart rate.

Explanation:
Epinephrine is a non-selective adrenergic agonist that stimulates both alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. In the context of anaphylaxis, epinephrine is used to counteract the severe bronchospasm, hypotension, and tissue edema that occur. 

In this patient, who is taking propranolol, a beta-blocker, the beta-1 adrenergic receptor blockade by propranolol will prevent the usual increase in heart rate that is seen with epinephrine administration. Beta-1 adrenergic receptors are primarily located in the heart and their stimulation increases heart rate. Therefore, in the presence of propranolol, the expected effect of epinephrine on heart rate would be decreased, not increased.

The other options are not correct because:
(A) Decreased bronchodilation: Epinephrine is a potent bronchodilator and its administration would result in increased bronchodilation, not decreased.
(B) Increased motility of the gastrointestinal tract: Epinephrine can decrease gastrointestinal motility, not increase it.
(D) Decreased blood pressure: Epinephrine is used to increase blood pressure in the context of anaphylaxis-induced hypotension.
(E) Increased heart rate: As explained above, the expected effect of epinephrine on heart rate in the presence of propranolol would be decreased, not increased.",

The patient's presentation is consistent with a craniopharyngioma, which is a benign tumor that arises from remnants of Rathke pouch. Craniopharyngiomas commonly present with symptoms related to mass effect on adjacent structures, such as short stature, headaches, visual disturbances, and endocrine abnormalities. The patient's short stature, frequent urination, and excessive thirst are suggestive of diabetes insipidus, which can occur due to compression of the posterior pituitary gland by the tumor. The absence of secondary sexual characteristics (Tanner stage 1) suggests hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, which can result from compression of the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk. The patient's parents' heights are also suggestive of a genetic cause of short stature, but the presence of other symptoms and laboratory findings make craniopharyngioma a more likely diagnosis.",
"A 31-year-old woman, gravida 2, para 1, at 32 weeks' gestation presents to the emergency department for clear vaginal discharge that started roughly 26 hours ago. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. Her first child was born at term by vaginal delivery. She has no history of any serious illnesses. She does not drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes. Current medications include vitamin supplements. Her temperature is 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 128/82 mm Hg. Speculum examination demonstrates clear fluid at the cervical os. The fetal heart rate is reactive at 160/min with no decelerations. Tocometry shows uterine contractions. Nitrazine testing is positive. She is started on indomethacin. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Administer ampicillin and perform amnioinfusion
(B): Administer ampicillin and progesterone
(C): Administer ampicillin and test amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity
(D): Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section
(E): Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with induction of labor
","Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section",Correct,"The correct answer is (D): Administer betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceed with cesarean section.

Explanation:
This patient is presenting with clear vaginal discharge, positive nitrazine testing, and uterine contractions at 32 weeks' gestation. These findings are consistent with preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). PPROM is defined as rupture of membranes before 37 weeks' gestation. It is a significant complication of pregnancy and can lead to preterm delivery, which carries risks for both the mother and the fetus.

The management of PPROM depends on the gestational age and the presence of signs of infection. In this case, the patient is at 32 weeks' gestation and has positive nitrazine testing, indicating the presence of amniotic fluid. The next step in management should be to administer betamethasone and ampicillin and proceed with cesarean section.

Betamethasone is a corticosteroid that is given to enhance fetal lung maturity and reduce the risk of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. Ampicillin is an antibiotic that is given to prevent or treat infection in cases of PPROM. Cesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery in cases of PPROM to minimize the risk of cord prolapse and infection.

Administering ampicillin and performing amnioinfusion (option A) is not the most appropriate next step in management because amnioinfusion is not indicated in cases of PPROM. Administering ampicillin and progesterone (option B) is not the most appropriate next step in management because progesterone is not indicated in cases of PPROM. Administering ampicillin and testing amniotic fluid for fetal lung maturity (option C) is not the most appropriate next step in management because the patient already has positive nitrazine testing, indicating the presence of amniotic fluid. Administering betamethasone, ampicillin, and proceeding with induction of labor (option E) is not the most appropriate next step in management because cesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery in cases of PPROM.",
"A 63-year-old man comes to the emergency department because of a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. He has a history of constipation. His temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°C). Abdominal examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness with no guarding or rebound. Laboratory studies show a leukocyte count of 19,000/mm3. A CT scan of the abdomen shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a 5.0-cm, low-attenuation pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels. CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection yields 250 mL of yellow-greenish fluid. Release of which of the following substances is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion?
Options:
(A): Staphylococcal coagulase
(B): Interferon-gamma
(C): Lipoteichoic acid
(D): Interleukin-3
(E): Lysosomal enzymes
",Lysosomal enzymes,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Lysosomal enzymes.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with diverticulitis, which is inflammation or infection of the diverticula in the colon. In this case, the CT scan shows segmental wall thickening of the descending colon with multiple diverticula and a pelvic lesion with air-fluid levels, indicating the presence of an abscess.

The release of lysosomal enzymes is most likely responsible for the formation of the drained lesion. Lysosomal enzymes are released by neutrophils, which are the primary immune cells involved in the inflammatory response. These enzymes help to break down cellular debris and bacteria, promoting the formation of an abscess.

Staphylococcal coagulase is an enzyme produced by Staphylococcus aureus that converts fibrinogen to fibrin, promoting clot formation. While Staphylococcus aureus can cause abscesses, it is not the most likely cause in this case.

Interferon-gamma is a cytokine that plays a role in the immune response against viral and intracellular bacterial infections. It is not directly involved in the formation of abscesses.

Lipoteichoic acid is a component of the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. While it can activate the immune system, it is not directly responsible for the formation of abscesses.

Interleukin-3 is a cytokine that stimulates the production and differentiation of various blood cells. It is not directly involved in the formation of abscesses.",
"A researcher is studying risk factors for open-angle glaucoma in a group of elderly patients at a primary care clinic. He is curious if patients with diabetes (defined as fasting serum glucose ≥126 mg/dL on two separate readings) are at increased risk of developing open-angle glaucoma over time. Which of the following is the best statement of the null hypothesis for this study?
Options:
(A): The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes
(B): Having diabetes will not cause changes in risk of future open-angle glaucoma
(C): Diabetes is not associated with an increased prevalence of open-angle glaucoma
(D): The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is higher in patients with diabetes than in those without diabetes
(E): Improved adherence to antidiabetics will not be effective in decreasing future open-angle glaucoma risk
",The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes,Correct,"The correct choice is (A): The future risk of open-angle glaucoma is the same in patients with and those without diabetes.

Explanation: The null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no significant difference or relationship between variables being studied. In this case, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the future risk of open-angle glaucoma between patients with and without diabetes. This is the best statement of the null hypothesis because it directly addresses the research question and assumes no association between diabetes and the risk of open-angle glaucoma.",
"Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
Given the original research abstract above, which of the following would be true if the authors had inadvertently encountered a type 1 error?
Options:
(A): A type 1 error means the study is not significantly powered to detect a true difference between study groups.
(B): A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.
(C): A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is false, yet is accepted in error.
(D): A type 1 error is a beta (β) error and is usually 0.1 or 0.2.
(E): A type 1 error is dependent on the confidence interval of a study.
",A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.,Correct,"The correct choice is (B): A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true but is rejected in error.

Explanation:
In the context of this study, a type 1 error would occur if the authors mistakenly rejected the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the study groups (mepolizumab and placebo) in terms of reducing asthma exacerbations and improving markers of asthma control. This means that the authors would have concluded that there is a significant difference between the groups when, in fact, there is no true difference. This would be a false positive result.

In this study, the authors found that both intravenous and subcutaneous administration of mepolizumab significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and improved markers of asthma control compared to placebo. The p-values reported for these comparisons were all less than 0.001, indicating a very low probability of obtaining these results by chance alone. Therefore, if the authors had encountered a type 1 error, it would mean that they mistakenly concluded that there was a significant difference between the groups when there was actually no true difference.",
"A 30-year-old Japanese woman is brought to the emergency department after fainting at work. She says she was only unconscious for a moment and recovered quickly. She reports increasing fatigue and joint pain for the past 4 months. Her blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg, and her temperature is 36.6°C (98.0°F). On physical examination, the patient is fully conscious. Her radial pulse is absent at her right wrist and 1+ at her left wrist. Laboratory findings are significant for the following:
Hemoglobin: 10.9 g/dL
Hematocrit: 34.7%
Leukocyte count: 5,500/mm3
Neutrophils: 65%
Lymphocytes: 30%
Monocytes: 5%

Platelet count: 190,000/mm3
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 56 mm/h
What complications is this patient at risk for?
Options:
(A): Amaurosis fugax
(B): Myocardial infarction
(C): Tongue infarction
(D): Palpable purpura
(E): Polyneuropathy
",Myocardial infarction,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Myocardial infarction.

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario presents with symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and fainting, along with physical examination findings of absent radial pulse at the right wrist and 1+ pulse at the left wrist. These findings suggest the presence of arterial occlusion, which can lead to complications such as myocardial infarction.

The laboratory findings of anemia (hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL, hematocrit 34.7%) and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (56 mm/h) further support the possibility of arterial occlusion. The reduced blood flow caused by arterial occlusion can lead to tissue ischemia and subsequent complications, including myocardial infarction.

Amaurosis fugax (option A) refers to transient monocular vision loss and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Tongue infarction (option C) is a rare complication that can occur in patients with vasculitis, but it is not the most likely complication in this patient.

Palpable purpura (option D) refers to small, palpable, purplish-red spots on the skin caused by bleeding into the skin. While this can be seen in certain vasculitides, it is not the most likely complication in this patient.

Polyneuropathy (option E) refers to damage or dysfunction of multiple peripheral nerves and is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.",
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of an acute, painful swelling of the left labia that she first noticed that morning. She also reports some pain while sitting and walking. She is sexually active with her boyfriend and states that she has been having pain during vaginal intercourse lately. She has no history of serious illness. She appears uncomfortable. Her temperature is 38°C (100.4°F), pulse is 90/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a left-sided, tender mass surrounded by edema and erythema in the left inner labia. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Sitz baths
(B): Cryotherapy
(C): Incision and drainage
(D): Biopsy
(E): Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
",Incision and drainage,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Incision and drainage.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation of acute, painful swelling of the left labia with surrounding edema and erythema, along with the presence of a tender mass, the most likely diagnosis is Bartholin's abscess. Bartholin's abscess is a common condition in sexually active women and occurs when the Bartholin's gland becomes blocked, leading to the formation of an abscess.

The most appropriate next step in management is incision and drainage of the abscess. This procedure involves making a small incision to drain the pus and relieve the pressure, which will provide immediate pain relief for the patient. Incision and drainage is the standard treatment for Bartholin's abscess and is effective in resolving the infection.

Sitz baths (choice A) can be used as adjunctive therapy after incision and drainage to promote healing and provide comfort, but they are not the primary treatment for Bartholin's abscess.

Cryotherapy (choice B) is not indicated in the management of Bartholin's abscess. Cryotherapy is typically used for the treatment of precancerous or cancerous lesions, not for abscesses.

Biopsy (choice D) is not necessary in this case. The patient's presentation is consistent with Bartholin's abscess, and a biopsy is not required for diagnosis or management.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (choice E) is an antibiotic and may be used as adjunctive therapy after incision and drainage to prevent infection or treat any underlying infection. However, it is not the primary treatment for Bartholin's abscess.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient is incision and drainage (choice C).",
"A 21-year-old female presents to the clinic requesting prenatal counseling. She was born with a disease that has led her to have recurrent upper respiratory infections throughout her life requiring antibiotic prophylaxis and chest physiotherapy as well as pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. She marries a man (without this disease phenotype) from a population where the prevalence of this disease is 1/100. What is the chance that their child will have the disease of interest?
Options:
(A): 9/100
(B): 1/10
(C): 18/100
(D): 81/100
(E): 9/10
",9/100,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) 9/100.

Explanation:
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. In order for a child to have CF, both parents must be carriers of the CF gene mutation. 

Given that the female in this case has the disease phenotype, she must be homozygous for the CF gene mutation (i.e., she has two copies of the CF gene mutation). 

The prevalence of the disease in the population where the man is from is 1/100, which means that the probability of him being a carrier of the CF gene mutation is 1/100. 

To calculate the chance that their child will have the disease, we need to consider the probability of the man being a carrier and the probability of the child inheriting the CF gene mutation from both parents.

The probability of the man being a carrier is 1/100. 

The probability of the child inheriting the CF gene mutation from both parents is 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, since each parent contributes one copy of the gene to the child.

Therefore, the chance that their child will have the disease is 1/100 * 1/4 = 1/400.

However, since the female already has the disease phenotype, we know that she is homozygous for the CF gene mutation. Therefore, the chance that their child will have the disease is actually 1/400 + 1/4 = 1/100.

So, the correct answer is (A) 9/100.",
"A 45-year-old woman presents to the physician with a history of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis. She was diagnosed with hypertension in the past and is now regularly taking antihypertensive medication (amlodipine 10 mg once daily). She has had a diffuse thyroid swelling for the past 4 months. She complains of pain in the long bones of her arms and legs for the past 3 months. She is slightly built, appears thin, and is anxious and apprehensive. Her skin is moist and warm. Her weight is 45 kg (99.2 lb) and height is 146 cm (4 ft 7 in); BMI is 21.12 kg/m2. Her pulse is 116/min, the blood pressure is 196/102 mm Hg, the respiratory rate is 29/min, and the temperature is 37.2°C (99.0°F). Diffuse and firm thyromegaly is present. Her upper extremities exhibit fine tremors during an anxiety attack. The laboratory test results reveal elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines. Serum epinephrine, calcitonin, and parathormone levels are also elevated. Hypercalcemia and hyperglycemia are also noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome
(B): Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1
(C): Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A
(D): Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2B
(E): Neurofibromatosis
",Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A.

Explanation:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A is the most likely diagnosis in this patient. MEN 2A is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism. The patient in this case has symptoms and findings consistent with all three components of MEN 2A. 

The patient's history of diffuse thyroid swelling, along with the presence of thyromegaly on physical examination, suggests the presence of MTC. MTC is a tumor of the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland and is associated with elevated serum calcitonin levels. In this case, the patient's serum calcitonin levels are elevated, further supporting the diagnosis of MTC.

The patient's symptoms of headache, palpitations, and episodic diaphoresis, along with the presence of elevated 24-hour urinary VMA and metanephrines, suggest the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are tumors of the adrenal medulla that secrete catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as headache, palpitations, and diaphoresis. The elevated levels of VMA and metanephrines in this patient's urine are consistent with the diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma.

Lastly, the patient's elevated parathormone levels and the presence of hypercalcemia suggest the presence of hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism is a common component of MEN 2A and is characterized by increased parathormone secretion and subsequent hypercalcemia.

The other options listed (Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, MEN 1, MEN 2B, Cowden syndrome, and Neurofibromatosis) are not associated with the specific combination of MTC, pheochromocytoma, and hyperparathyroidism seen in this patient.",
"A 57-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 1-year history of increasing shortness of breath on exertion and a cough productive of a small amount of grayish-white phlegm. The cough had been initially nonproductive. He has not had fever or chest pain. He is originally from China and visits his family there once every year. He has worked as a car salesman for 15 years and worked in a shipyard before that for 22 years. He smoked half a pack of cigarettes daily for 13 years but stopped 25 years ago. His temperature is 37.1°C (98.8°F), pulse is 86/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg. Fine expiratory crackles are heard at both lung bases. An x-ray of the chest shows patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening in both lungs. A photomicrograph from a sputum sample is shown. Further evaluation of this patient is most likely to show which of the following findings?
Options:
(A): Increased alveolar-arterial gradient
(B): Bloody pleural effusion
(C): Increased total lung capacity
(D): Concave flow-volume loop
(E): Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO)
",Increased alveolar-arterial gradient,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Increased alveolar-arterial gradient.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are suggestive of a chronic respiratory condition. The presence of shortness of breath on exertion, cough with grayish-white phlegm, and fine expiratory crackles on lung examination indicate a possible obstructive lung disease.

The x-ray findings of patchy infiltrates and supradiaphragmatic pleural thickening further support the diagnosis of an obstructive lung disease. These findings are consistent with chronic bronchitis or bronchiectasis, which are commonly seen in individuals with a history of smoking and occupational exposure to dust or fumes.

The increased alveolar-arterial gradient is a characteristic finding in obstructive lung diseases. It reflects the impaired gas exchange that occurs due to the obstruction of airflow in the small airways. In this patient, the obstructive lung disease is likely causing ventilation-perfusion mismatch, leading to a decreased oxygenation of the blood and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient.

Bloody pleural effusion (option B) is not likely in this patient as there is no mention of chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of pleural involvement.

Increased total lung capacity (option C) is not expected in obstructive lung diseases. Instead, these conditions are associated with decreased lung volumes due to air trapping.

Concave flow-volume loop (option D) is seen in restrictive lung diseases, not obstructive lung diseases.

Increased diffusing capacity (DLCO) (option E) is not typically seen in obstructive lung diseases. It is more commonly seen in conditions such as pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension.

Therefore, the most likely finding in further evaluation of this patient would be an increased alveolar-arterial gradient, indicating impaired gas exchange due to obstructive lung disease.",
"A 45-year-old woman presents with sudden-onset dyspnea. Her past medical history is significant for varicose veins in her lower extremities, well-controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, and a 25 pack-year smoking history. The patient currently takes metformin and pioglitazone. Family history is significant for her sister who died at the age of 35 because of a pulmonary embolism. Her temperature is 37.8°C (100.0°F), the pulse is 111/min, the respirations are 18/min, and the blood pressure is 130/60 mm Hg. On physical examination, the patient is pale and diaphoretic. Cardiac exam is significant for an S3 gallop. There is erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg. Ultrasound of her left leg is positive for a deep vein thrombosis. The patient is admitted, and anticoagulation is started with a vitamin K inhibitor. However, despite these interventions, she dies shortly after admission. Which of the following was the most likely etiology of this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Distal peripheral microembolism
(B): Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
(C): Necrotizing fasciitis
(D): Protein S deficiency
(E): Waldenström macroglobulinemia
",Protein S deficiency,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Protein S deficiency.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with a pulmonary embolism, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by sudden-onset dyspnea. The patient has risk factors for venous thromboembolism, including varicose veins, smoking history, and a family history of pulmonary embolism. The presence of erythema and swelling over multiple varicose veins in her left leg, along with a positive ultrasound for deep vein thrombosis, further supports the diagnosis of a venous thromboembolism.

Protein S deficiency is a hereditary condition that predisposes individuals to venous thromboembolism. Protein S is a natural anticoagulant that acts as a cofactor for protein C, which inhibits coagulation. Deficiency of protein S leads to a prothrombotic state, increasing the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.

The patient's sudden-onset dyspnea, tachycardia, and S3 gallop are consistent with right heart strain due to a pulmonary embolism. Despite starting anticoagulation with a vitamin K inhibitor, the patient unfortunately died shortly after admission, suggesting that the pulmonary embolism was severe and potentially fatal.

Distal peripheral microembolism, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, necrotizing fasciitis, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia are not the most likely etiologies in this patient's case. Distal peripheral microembolism refers to small emboli that travel to the peripheral arteries, which would not explain the patient's presentation of sudden-onset dyspnea and right heart strain. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a complication of heparin therapy characterized by a drop in platelet count and an increased risk of thrombosis, but the patient's symptoms and presentation are not consistent with this condition. Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe soft tissue infection that presents with rapidly progressive erythema, swelling, and pain, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the production of monoclonal IgM antibodies, which can lead to hyperviscosity syndrome and bleeding complications, but it is not the most likely etiology in this patient's case.",
"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother with increasing swelling of his right jaw for the past 2 months. She notes that he has been treated several times with different antibiotics, but that they have not helped. She reports no recent history of fever, chills, or night sweats. The boy has no significant medical history. He emigrated to the United States with his family from Nigeria 1 month ago. He is in the 85th percentile for height and weight, and he has been meeting all developmental milestones. His temperature is 37.8℃ (100.0℉). On physical examination, the patient has a prominent 8 × 8 cm mass over the right mandible. The mass has partially distorted the borders of the mandible and cheek. The overlying skin is erythematous. The mass is firm, immobile, and tender. The contralateral side of the face shows no abnormalities. An oral examination shows the disruption of the ipsilateral lower teeth and oral mucosa. The remainder of the physical exam is unremarkable. A biopsy of the mass is performed and a histopathologic analysis is seen in the image. Which of the following microorganisms is most likely associated with this patient’s condition?
Options:
(A): Babesia microti
(B): Bartonella henselae
(C): Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
(D): Epstein barr virus (EBV)
(E): Yersinia pestis
",Epstein barr virus (EBV),Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Epstein barr virus (EBV).

Explanation:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic analysis, the most likely microorganism associated with this patient's condition is Epstein barr virus (EBV). EBV is a member of the herpesvirus family and is known to cause infectious mononucleosis. In this case, the patient's symptoms of increasing swelling of the right jaw, disrupted lower teeth and oral mucosa, and erythematous skin overlying the mass are consistent with the clinical features of Burkitt lymphoma, which is associated with EBV infection.

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that commonly presents as a rapidly growing mass in the jaw or facial bones. It is more prevalent in areas with high malaria endemicity, such as sub-Saharan Africa. The patient's recent emigration from Nigeria, along with the histopathologic findings of a ""starry sky"" appearance with numerous mitotic figures, is highly suggestive of Burkitt lymphoma.

While the other options may be associated with certain infectious diseases, they are not typically associated with the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings described in this case. Babesia microti is a tick-borne parasite that causes babesiosis, Bartonella henselae is the causative agent of cat-scratch disease, Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is associated with various clinical manifestations including mononucleosis-like syndrome, and Yersinia pestis is the bacterium responsible for causing bubonic plague. None of these options are consistent with the patient's presentation.",
"A 3-year-old male was brought to the pediatrician with severe lip lacerations, with a portion of his tongue appearing to be bitten off, as well as missing portions of the fingers on his right hand. A family history is notable for two similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side. A urinalysis revealed a high level of uric acid. Which of the following is the mode of inheritance for this disorder?
Options:
(A): X-linked recessive
(B): X-linked dominant
(C): Autosomal dominant
(D): Autosomal recessvie
(E): Maternally inherited mitochondrial defect
",X-linked recessive,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) X-linked recessive.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the disorder in question is likely to be inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. This is supported by the presence of similar cases in male cousins on the mother's side, indicating that the disorder is more common in males. X-linked recessive disorders are typically seen in males, as they have only one X chromosome. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, which allows for the possibility of being carriers of the disorder without showing symptoms.

Additionally, the presence of a high level of uric acid in the urinalysis suggests a possible diagnosis of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by severe lip lacerations, missing fingers, and high levels of uric acid.",
"An asymptomatic 65-year-old woman is found to have T-score of -2.6 SD on routine bone mineral density screening. She has a 10-year history of hypertension and an esophageal stricture due to severe gastroesophageal reflux disease.

(B): Skin infections
(C): Osteosarcoma
(D): Hypercholesterolemia
(E): Deep vein thrombosis
""
","Deep vein thrombosis
""",Correct,"The correct answer is (E): Deep vein thrombosis.

Explanation:
The drug that is being used to treat the patient's osteoporosis and reduce her risk of developing breast cancer is likely a bisphosphonate, such as alendronate or zoledronic acid. Bisphosphonates are known to increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). DVT occurs when a blood clot forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg, and can lead to serious complications if the clot breaks loose and travels to the lungs. 

Other adverse effects associated with bisphosphonates include gastrointestinal side effects (such as esophageal irritation or ulceration), musculoskeletal pain, and osteonecrosis of the jaw. However, in this patient's case, the most significant risk is the development of DVT due to her use of bisphosphonates. It is important to monitor patients on bisphosphonate therapy for signs and symptoms of DVT and to educate them about the signs and symptoms of DVT so that they can seek medical attention if necessary.",
"A 28-year-old woman, gravida 1, para 0, at 20 weeks' gestation comes to the physician with her husband for a prenatal visit. Her pregnancy has been uncomplicated. They are planning to travel to Ethiopia next month to visit the husband's family. Medications include folic acid and an iron supplement. Vital signs are within the normal range. Abdominal examination shows a uterus that is consistent with a 20-week gestation. Which of the following drugs is most suitable for pre-exposure prophylaxis against malaria?
Options:
(A): Doxycycline
(B): Primaquine
(C): Mefloquine
(D): Chloroquine
(E): Proguanil
",Mefloquine,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Mefloquine.

Explanation:
According to the provided context information, mefloquine is the most suitable drug for pre-exposure prophylaxis against malaria in pregnant women traveling to areas with drug-resistant malaria. Mefloquine is generally considered safe in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, although data on first-trimester exposure are limited but reassuring. Chloroquine and proguanil are regarded as safe, but there are very few regions where these drugs can be recommended for protection. Doxycycline, primaquine, and tafenoquine should not be used during pregnancy. Therefore, mefloquine is the best option for this pregnant woman traveling to Ethiopia.",
"A 26-year-old man presents to the office complaining of persistent epigastric pain for the past 2 months. He states that his pain is worse a few hours after he eats. His father had similar symptoms. Past medical history is insignificant. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. The vital signs include blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg, heart rate 83/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). Physical examination is insignificant except for mild epigastric tenderness. A metabolic panel reveals the following:
Serum sodium 136 mEq/L
Serum potassium 4.2 mEq/L
Calcium 13.2 mg/dL
Bicarbonate 26 mEq/L
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy reveals multiple duodenal ulcers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Gastroesophageal reflux disease
(B): Gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type
(C): H. pylori infection
(D): VIPoma
(E): MEN1
",MEN1,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) MEN1.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of persistent epigastric pain, worse a few hours after eating, along with a family history of similar symptoms, suggests a possible genetic disorder. The laboratory findings of elevated calcium levels (13.2 mg/dL) and multiple duodenal ulcers seen on upper gastrointestinal endoscopy further support this suspicion.

MEN1 (Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of tumors in multiple endocrine organs, including the parathyroid glands, pancreas, and pituitary gland. The elevated calcium levels in this patient suggest the presence of parathyroid adenomas, which can cause hypercalcemia. The duodenal ulcers may be due to excessive gastric acid secretion caused by gastrinomas, which can also be seen in MEN1.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition characterized by the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus, causing symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation. However, the patient's symptoms of persistent epigastric pain and the presence of duodenal ulcers on endoscopy are not consistent with GERD.

Gastric adenocarcinoma, intestinal type, is a type of stomach cancer that typically presents with symptoms such as weight loss, early satiety, and upper abdominal pain. The patient's age, lack of significant weight loss, and the presence of duodenal ulcers make this diagnosis less likely.

H. pylori infection is a common cause of peptic ulcers. However, the patient's family history, elevated calcium levels, and lack of response to standard treatment for H. pylori make this diagnosis less likely.

VIPoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that secretes vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to symptoms such as watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria (WDHA syndrome). The patient's symptoms of persistent epigastric pain and the presence of duodenal ulcers are not consistent with VIPoma.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is MEN1, given the combination of persistent epigastric pain, family history, elevated calcium levels, and multiple duodenal ulcers.",
"The parents of a 16-year-old boy with type 1 diabetes mellitus present requesting information about the drug, exenatide, an injectable drug that only needs to be administered once a week. The patient’s blood glucose levels have been difficult to control on his current insulin regimen due to poor adherence to recommended therapy, and he has had difficulty putting on weight despite eating copiously. The patient is afebrile and his vital signs are within normal limits. His body mass index (BMI) is 19 kg/m2. Which of the following best describes why the patient should not be switched to exenatide?
Options:
(A): Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.
(B): Exenatide suppresses glucagon secretion, which increases the risk of hypoglycemia.
(C): Suppression of appetite makes it even harder for him to gain weight.
(D): Exenatide is contraindicated in children below 18 years.
(E): Gastric emptying is inhibited by exenatide.
",Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Insulin production by the pancreas is insufficient for exenatide to be effective.

Explanation:
Exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is primarily used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It works by enhancing glucose-dependent insulin secretion and slowing gastric emptying. However, in this case, the patient has type 1 diabetes mellitus, which is characterized by insufficient insulin production by the pancreas. Exenatide relies on the presence of functioning beta cells in the pancreas to stimulate insulin secretion. Since the patient's insulin production is already insufficient, exenatide would not be effective in controlling his blood glucose levels. Therefore, the patient should not be switched to exenatide.",
"A 79-year-old woman comes to the physician for the evaluation of a 2-month history of a non-productive cough and fatigue. During this period, she also has had a 4.5-kg (10-lb) weight loss and has become increasingly short of breath with mild exertion. She has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Three months ago, she was in India for 3 weeks to attend a family wedding. She worked as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 47 years. Her current medications include enalapril, digoxin, isosorbide, spironolactone, and metoprolol. She appears thin. Her temperature is 37.0°C (98.6°F), pulse is 90/min, respirations are 25/min, and blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 94%. There is dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds over the right lung base. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Laboratory studies show a glucose level of 90 mg/dL, serum lactate dehydrogenase of 227 U/L, and serum protein of 6.3 g/dL. An x-ray of the chest shows nodular pleural lesions on the right side and a moderate-sized pleural effusion. Thoracentesis shows 250 ml of turbid fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid aspirate shows:
Erythrocyte count 1/mm3
Leukocyte count 4,000/mm3
Glucose 59 mg/dl
Lactate dehydrogenase 248 U/L
Protein 3.8 g/dL
Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's effusion?""
Options:
(A): Bronchial adenocarcinoma
(B): Mesothelioma
(C): Nephrotic syndrome
(D): Tuberculosis
(E): Congestive heart failure
",Mesothelioma,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Mesothelioma.

Explanation:
The patient's history of working as a seamstress in a textile factory for 50 years suggests exposure to asbestos, which is a known risk factor for mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a malignant tumor that arises from the mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum, or pericardium. It is commonly associated with asbestos exposure, and the latency period between exposure and development of symptoms can be several decades. The patient's symptoms of non-productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, and shortness of breath are consistent with mesothelioma. The presence of nodular pleural lesions on the chest x-ray and a moderate-sized pleural effusion further support this diagnosis. The pleural fluid analysis shows a low glucose level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, and elevated protein, which are typical findings in malignant pleural effusions. The erythrocyte count is low, indicating minimal blood in the pleural fluid. The leukocyte count is within the normal range, ruling out infection as the cause of the effusion. Congestive heart failure would typically present with bilateral pleural effusions, and the patient's history of asbestos exposure makes mesothelioma a more likely diagnosis than bronchial adenocarcinoma or tuberculosis. Nephrotic syndrome is not associated with pleural effusions.",
"A 25-year-old woman comes to the physician because of irregular menstrual bleeding. Menses have occurred at 30- to 90-day intervals since menarche at the age of 12 years. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She is sexually active with her husband and they do not use condoms. There is no personal or family history of serious illness. She is 170 cm (5 ft 7 in) tall and weighs 73 kg (161 lb); BMI is 25.3 kg/m2. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Examination shows oily skin and severe acne on the face. There is dark hair on the upper lip and around both nipples. Laboratory studies show:
Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate 6.2 μg/mL (N=0.5–5.4)
Follicle-stimulating hormone 20 mIU/mL
Luteinizing hormone 160 mIU/mL
Testosterone 4.1 nmol/L (N < 3.5)
A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient?""
Options:
(A): 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol level measurements
(B): CA-125 level measurement
(C): Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements
(D): TSH and T4 level measurements
(E): Transvaginal ultrasonography
""
",Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. It is associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, including dyslipidemia and type 2 diabetes.

The patient's symptoms of irregular menstrual bleeding, hirsutism (dark hair on the upper lip and around the nipples), and acne are consistent with hyperandrogenism, which is a key feature of PCOS. The laboratory findings of elevated testosterone and DHEA-S further support this diagnosis.

Given the association between PCOS and metabolic abnormalities, it is important to screen for comorbidities such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Blood glucose and cholesterol level measurements are the most appropriate next step in screening for these comorbidities. Elevated blood glucose levels may indicate insulin resistance or diabetes, while abnormal cholesterol levels may suggest dyslipidemia.

The other options are not the most appropriate next step in screening for comorbidities in this patient:
(A) 17-hydroxyprogesterone and cortisol level measurements: These tests are used to evaluate for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which typically presents with symptoms of virilization in childhood or adolescence. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with PCOS.
(B) CA-125 level measurement: CA-125 is a tumor marker that is elevated in ovarian cancer. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with PCOS, and ovarian cancer is less likely in a young patient without a family history of serious illness.
(D) TSH and T4 level measurements: These tests are used to evaluate for thyroid dysfunction. While thyroid dysfunction can cause menstrual irregularities, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are more consistent with PCOS.
(E) Transvaginal ultrasonography: Transvaginal ultrasonography is used to evaluate the ovaries for the presence of cysts, which is a characteristic finding in PCOS. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings already suggest PCOS, so further confirmation with ultrasonography is not necessary at this time.",
"A 51-year-old woman goes to respiratory function testing in order to evaluate her shortness of breath. She recently joined a walking program with her friends in order to lose weight; however, she noticed that she was not able to keep up with her friends during the program. She has a 60-pack-year history of smoking as well as hypertension well-controlled on medication. The following represent the parameters for this patient's respiratory anatomy and function:

Vital capacity (VC): 5,000 mL
Inspiratory reserve volume (IRV): 2,500 mL
Functional reserve capacity (FRC): 2,700 mL
Residual volume (RV): 1,000 mL
Upper airway volume: 100 mL
Conducting airway volume: 125 mL

Inspired CO2 pressure (PiCO2): 1 mmHg
Arterial CO2 pressure (PaCO2): 50 mmHg
Expired CO2 pressure (PeCO2): 20 mmHg

Which of the following best represents the total volume of gas in this patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange?
Options:
(A): 225 mL
(B): 480 mL
(C): 600 mL
(D): 800 mL
(E): 1200 mL
",480 mL,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) 480 mL.

Explanation:
The total volume of gas in the patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange can be calculated by subtracting the volume of gas in the conducting airways from the total lung capacity.

Total lung capacity (TLC) = Vital capacity (VC) + Residual volume (RV)
TLC = 5,000 mL + 1,000 mL = 6,000 mL

The volume of gas in the conducting airways is given as 125 mL.

Therefore, the total volume of gas that does not participate in gas exchange is:
TLC - Volume of gas in conducting airways = 6,000 mL - 125 mL = 5,875 mL

However, we need to consider that the upper airway volume (100 mL) also does not participate in gas exchange. So, we subtract this volume as well.

Total volume of gas that does not participate in gas exchange = 5,875 mL - 100 mL = 5,775 mL

Therefore, the total volume of gas in this patient's airways and lungs that does not participate in gas exchange is 5,775 mL, which is approximately 480 mL (option B).",
"A 44-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue, intermittent fever, a 4.0-kg (8.8-lb) weight loss, and a progressive, non-productive cough. She does not smoke. Physical examination shows mild wheezing over bilateral lung fields and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes. A CT scan of the chest is shown. A biopsy specimen of a cervical lymph node shows organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis. The initial treatment of this patient's condition should include which of the following drugs?
Options:
(A): Cisplatin
(B): Lamivudine
(C): Azithromycin
(D): Isoniazid
(E): Prednisone
",Prednisone,Correct,"The correct choice is (E) Prednisone.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the biopsy results showing organized epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells without focal necrosis, the most likely diagnosis is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin.

The initial treatment for sarcoidosis involves the use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Prednisone is a potent anti-inflammatory medication that helps to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation in the affected organs. It is the mainstay of treatment for sarcoidosis and is effective in controlling symptoms and preventing organ damage.

Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug used in the treatment of various types of cancer, but it is not indicated for the treatment of sarcoidosis.

Lamivudine is an antiviral medication used in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis B, but it is not indicated for the treatment of sarcoidosis.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections, but it is not indicated for the treatment of sarcoidosis.

Isoniazid is an antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis, but it is not indicated for the treatment of sarcoidosis.",
"A 55-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the physician because of a 3-day history of heavy vaginal bleeding, requiring more than 5 pads per day. Menopause occurred 1 year ago. She attained menarche at 10 years of age. She has a history of hypothyroidism and type 2 diabetes mellitus. She has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years but quit 5 years ago. Current medications include levothyroxine and metformin. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 86 kg (190 lb); BMI is 32 kg/m2. Physical examination shows mild vaginal atrophy and a normal cervix. The uterus and adnexa are nontender to palpation. Transvaginal ultrasonography shows an endometrial thickness of 6 mm. Endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands with no nuclear or cytological atypia. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
Options:
(A): Total hysterectomy
(B): Estrogen vaginal cream
(C): Reassurance and follow-up
(D): Progestin therapy
(E): Surgical endometrial ablation
",Progestin therapy,Correct,"The correct choice is (D) Progestin therapy.

Explanation:
The patient in this case is a postmenopausal woman with heavy vaginal bleeding. The most likely cause of this bleeding is endometrial hyperplasia, which is a precursor to endometrial cancer. The risk factors for endometrial hyperplasia include obesity, diabetes, and unopposed estrogen exposure. In this case, the patient has a history of type 2 diabetes and is overweight with a BMI of 32 kg/m2. The endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands, which is consistent with hyperplasia without atypia.

The most appropriate next step in management is progestin therapy. Progestins are used to oppose the estrogen stimulation of the endometrium and reduce the risk of progression to endometrial cancer. Progestin therapy can be administered orally, as a progestin-releasing intrauterine device (IUD), or as a progestin-containing vaginal cream. The choice of route of administration depends on patient preference and individual factors.

Total hysterectomy (choice A) is not necessary in this case because the patient has non-invasive endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Hysterectomy is a more invasive procedure and is typically reserved for cases of complex atypical hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.

Estrogen vaginal cream (choice B) is not appropriate in this case because the patient already has vaginal atrophy, which is a contraindication to estrogen therapy. Estrogen therapy can exacerbate vaginal atrophy and increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

Reassurance and follow-up (choice C) is not appropriate in this case because the patient has a significant risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia (obesity and diabetes) and the endometrial biopsy shows non-invasive proliferation of endometrial glands. Progestin therapy is necessary to reduce the risk of progression to endometrial cancer.

Surgical endometrial ablation (choice E) is not appropriate in this case because the patient has non-invasive endometrial hyperplasia without atypia. Surgical ablation is typically reserved for cases of persistent or recurrent bleeding after medical management or for patients who are not candidates for medical management.

Anastrozole therapy (choice F) is not appropriate in this case because anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor used in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. It is not indicated for the management of endometrial hyperplasia.",
"A 37-year-old woman with an HIV infection comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. Six months ago, combined antiretroviral therapy consisting of dolutegravir, tenofovir, and emtricitabine was initiated. Laboratory studies show a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen, including a drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation. Which of the following is the most likely drug?
Options:
(A): Enfuvirtide
(B): Efavirenz
(C): Ritonavir
(D): Raltegravir
(E): Lamivudine
""
",Efavirenz,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Raltegravir.

Explanation:
The patient is switched to a new treatment regimen because there has been a decrease in the CD4 count and an increase in the viral load despite ongoing treatment. The drug that acts by preventing viral DNA synthesis without undergoing intracellular phosphorylation is an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI). Raltegravir is an INSTI that inhibits the integration of viral DNA into the host genome by binding to the integrase enzyme. This prevents the replication of the virus and reduces the viral load. Therefore, raltegravir is the most likely drug in this scenario.",
"A 14-year-old girl presents with sudden drooping of the right side of her face with drooling and excessive tearing. The patient’s mother says that the patient was recently in northern Maine and spent most of her time during the trip outdoors. Physical examination reveals a slight asymmetry of the facial muscles with an inability to whistle or close the right eye. A circular red rash with central clearing is present on the trunk. There is also decreased taste sensation. Which of the following most likely transmitted the organism responsible for this patient’s illness?
Options:
(A): Ixodes scapularis
(B): Tsetse fly
(C): Culicidae
(D): Dermacentor variabilis
(E): Anopheles
",Ixodes scapularis,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Ixodes scapularis.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including sudden drooping of the right side of the face, drooling, excessive tearing, inability to whistle or close the right eye, and decreased taste sensation, are consistent with a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). 

The patient's recent trip to northern Maine and spending most of her time outdoors increases the likelihood of exposure to ticks. The circular red rash with central clearing on the trunk, known as erythema migrans, is a classic finding in Lyme disease. 

Therefore, the most likely organism responsible for this patient's illness is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis ticks.",
"A 66-year-old man with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes presents to the clinic with elevated liver function tests from baseline. He has a blood pressure of 136/92 mm Hg and a heart rate of 69/min. On physical examination, his heart sounds are regular and lung sounds are clear. Current medications include simvastatin, metformin, fenofibrate, hydrochlorothiazide, aspirin, glyburide, and lisinopril. Of these medications, which could contribute to the patient’s transaminitis?
Options:
(A): Metformin
(B): Simvastatin
(C): Aspirin
(D): Glyburide
(E): Lisinopril
",Simvastatin,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Simvastatin.

Explanation:
Transaminitis refers to elevated liver function tests, specifically elevated levels of liver enzymes such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Simvastatin is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels and belongs to a class of drugs called statins. Statins are known to cause liver enzyme elevations in some patients. While the incidence of significant liver injury with statins is rare, it is still a potential side effect that should be monitored for in patients taking these medications. In this case, the patient's elevated liver function tests could be attributed to simvastatin. 

Metformin (A) is an oral medication used to treat type 2 diabetes and does not typically cause liver enzyme elevations. Aspirin (C) is a commonly used medication for its anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet effects, but it is not known to cause liver enzyme elevations. Glyburide (D) is an oral medication used to lower blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and does not typically cause liver enzyme elevations. Lisinopril (E) is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used to treat high blood pressure and does not typically cause liver enzyme elevations.",
"A 7 -day-old newborn boy presents to the emergency department with a history of fever, irritability, and generalized erythema. During the first 2 days of clinical manifestations, the parents of the child tried to control the symptoms using acetaminophen; however, the newborn continued to be ill, and blisters were noticeable around the buttocks, hands, and feet. During the physical examination, the vital signs include body temperature 39.0°C (102.3°F), heart rate 130/min, and respiratory rate 45/min. Ears, nose, and oral mucosa preserved their integrity, while the skin presents with diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky’s sign. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Scarlet fever
(B): Scalded skin syndrome
(C): Impetigo
(D): Erysipela
(E): Pyoderma
",Scalded skin syndrome,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Scalded skin syndrome.

Scalded skin syndrome, also known as staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), is a bacterial skin infection caused by the exfoliative toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus. It primarily affects infants and young children, especially those under the age of 5.

The clinical presentation of scalded skin syndrome includes fever, irritability, and generalized erythema. The erythema often begins around the mouth and then spreads to involve the entire body. In this case, the newborn has diffuse blanching erythema. This is a characteristic feature of scalded skin syndrome.

One to two days after the onset of erythema, flaccid blisters appear, especially in areas of mechanical stress such as the buttocks, hands, and feet. The presence of blisters in these areas is consistent with the findings in this patient.

A positive Nikolsky's sign is another important clue for the diagnosis of scalded skin syndrome. Gentle pressure applied to the skin results in separation of the upper epidermis and wrinkling of the skin. This is due to the cleavage plane of the blisters being intraepidermal.

Other features that may be present in scalded skin syndrome include conjunctivitis and hyperemic mucous membranes. However, the ears, nose, and oral mucosa in this patient are preserved, indicating that they are not involved.

It is important to note that scalded skin syndrome is caused by Staphylococcus aureus and not Streptococcus pyogenes, which is the causative organism in scarlet fever. Therefore, scarlet fever (option A) is not the correct diagnosis.

Impetigo (option C) is a superficial bacterial skin infection that can also be caused by Staphylococcus aureus. However, the presentation of diffuse blanching erythema and flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky's sign is not consistent with impetigo.

Erysipelas (option D) is a superficial skin infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. It typically presents with a well-demarcated, raised, and erythematous plaque. The presence of blisters and a positive Nikolsky's sign is not characteristic of erysipelas.

Pyoderma (option E) is a term used to describe any bacterial skin infection. However, the specific findings of diffuse blanching erythema, flaccid blisters, and a positive Nikolsky's sign are more suggestive of scalded skin syndrome rather than a generic pyoderma.

In conclusion, based on the clinical presentation of diffuse blanching erythema, flaccid blisters with a positive Nikolsky's sign, and the absence of involvement of the ears, nose, and oral mucosa, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is scalded skin syndrome (option B).",
"A 60-year-old woman presents to the outpatient clinic complaining of severe vulvar itching that has been gradually worsening for the past year. She mentions that she has tried over-the-counter lubricants, but lubricants do not seem to provide substantial relief. Her medical history is remarkable for diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. Menopause occurred at 52 years of age. She has been sexually active with her husband until recently and reports severe pain during vaginal intercourse. The physical examination reveals dry, thin, white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area with atrophy of the labia minora. The clitoris appears retracted. The perianal skin appears pale and wrinkled. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Squamous cell hyperplasia
(B): Lichen sclerosus
(C): Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva
(D): Lichen planus
(E): Atrophic vaginitis
",Lichen sclerosus,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Lichen sclerosus.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is lichen sclerosus. Lichen sclerosus is a chronic, progressive dermatologic condition characterized by marked inflammation, epithelial thinning, and distinctive dermal changes. It commonly presents with severe vulvar itching, pain during intercourse, and white plaque-like lesions in the vulvar area. Atrophy of the labia minora and retraction of the clitoris are also characteristic findings. The perianal skin may also be affected, appearing pale and wrinkled. Lichen sclerosus is more common in postmenopausal women and can be associated with autoimmune diseases. It is important to differentiate lichen sclerosus from other conditions such as squamous cell hyperplasia, squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva, lichen planus, and atrophic vaginitis, as the management and treatment options differ for each condition.",
"A 50-year-old woman with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) presents to your clinic with complaints of left eye pain and reduced vision. She notes that she was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to presentation when she noticed some mild tenderness around her left eye, unrelieved by any pain relievers. This morning when she woke up she was unable to see out of her left eye and made an appointment to come see you. Other than SLE, her medical history is unremarkable. She has had no additional symptoms other than pain and vision loss. Her vital signs are all within normal limits. On exam, she has no vision in her left eye, but 20/30 visual acuity in her right eye. When you shine a light in her left eye there is no response. What response would you expect when you shine a light in her right eye?
Options:
(A): Bilateral mydriasis
(B): Bilateral miosis
(C): Miosis of the right eye only
(D): Miosis of the left eye only
(E): Mydriasis of the left eye
",Bilateral miosis,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Bilateral miosis.

Explanation:
In this scenario, the patient presents with left eye pain and reduced vision, with no response to light in the left eye. These findings suggest that there is a problem with the left eye, specifically involving the pupillary response to light.

When light is shone in the left eye and there is no response, it indicates that the left eye is not able to constrict the pupil in response to light. This is known as a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) or Marcus Gunn pupil. It is a sign of optic nerve dysfunction or severe retinal disease in the affected eye.

In contrast, when light is shone in the right eye, we would expect to see a normal pupillary response. This is because the right eye is not affected by the same pathology as the left eye. Therefore, the correct answer is bilateral miosis, indicating that both pupils are constricted in response to light.",
"A 25-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with abdominal pain. She states that she was walking up the stairs at work when she felt sudden and severe abdominal pain followed by nausea and vomiting. Her past medical history is non-contributory and she is not currently taking any medications. Her temperature is 99.7°F (37.6°C), blood pressure is 122/78 mmHg, pulse is 120/min, respirations are 17/min, and oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Physical exam is notable for an absence of abdominal tenderness, a left adnexal mass, and left adnexal tenderness. A transvaginal ultrasound demonstrates free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow. A urinary pregnancy test is negative. The patient's symptoms persisted after ibuprofen and acetaminophen. Which of the following is the best next step in management?
Options:
(A): CT scan of the abdomen
(B): Laparoscopy
(C): Laparotomy
(D): MRI of the pelvis
(E): Observation and serial abdominal exams
",Laparoscopy,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Laparoscopy.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary twists on its vascular pedicle, leading to compromised blood flow and subsequent ischemia. The sudden and severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with this diagnosis.

The physical exam findings of a left adnexal mass and tenderness further support the suspicion of ovarian torsion. The transvaginal ultrasound findings of free fluid surrounding the ovary with edema and the presence of doppler flow are also consistent with this diagnosis.

In cases of suspected ovarian torsion, prompt surgical intervention is necessary to detorse the ovary and restore blood flow. Laparoscopy is the preferred approach for this procedure as it is minimally invasive and allows for visualization and manipulation of the ovary. Laparotomy (choice C) is a more invasive option and is typically reserved for cases where laparoscopy is not feasible or if there are signs of ovarian necrosis.

CT scan of the abdomen (choice A) and MRI of the pelvis (choice D) may provide additional information, but they are not the best next step in management. Observation and serial abdominal exams (choice E) would not be appropriate as ovarian torsion is a surgical emergency that requires immediate intervention.",
"A 65-year-old man comes to the physician because of progressively worsening fatigue for 6 months. During this time, he has also had shortness of breath and palpitations on exertion. He has noticed blood in his stools on three separate occasions in the past 4 months. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. He drinks two to four beers daily. He does not smoke. His pulse is 95/min and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Examination shows pale conjunctivae. The abdomen is soft with no organomegaly. Rectal examination is unremarkable. His hemoglobin concentration is 7.2 g/dL, hematocrit is 32%, and mean corpuscular volume is 68 μm3. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding?
Options:
(A): Dilated submucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus
(B): Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall
(C): Symptomatic enlargement of hemorrhoidal plexus
(D): Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon
(E): Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall
",Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall,Correct,"The correct choice is (E): Arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall.

Explanation:
This patient's presentation is consistent with chronic blood loss anemia, as evidenced by his fatigue, shortness of breath, and palpitations on exertion. The presence of blood in his stools on multiple occasions further supports the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding. Given his history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease, as well as his alcohol consumption, it is important to consider the possibility of an underlying vascular abnormality as the cause of his bleeding.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can occur in various organs, including the gastrointestinal tract. In the colon, AVMs can lead to chronic gastrointestinal bleeding. The dilated submucosal veins in the lower third of the esophagus (choice A) are characteristic of esophageal varices, which are commonly seen in patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Inflammation in an outpouching of the colonic wall (choice B) describes diverticulitis, which can cause acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding but is less likely to be the cause of chronic bleeding in this patient. Symptomatic enlargement of the hemorrhoidal plexus (choice C) typically presents with bright red blood per rectum and is less likely to cause chronic blood loss anemia. Chronic mucosal and submucosal inflammation of the colon (choice D) may be seen in inflammatory bowel disease, but this patient's presentation is not consistent with that diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's bleeding is an arteriovenous malformation in the colonic wall (choice E). This should be further evaluated with colonoscopy or other imaging modalities to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.",
"A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department with her boyfriend 2 hours after an episode of loss of consciousness. She was seated and was being tattooed on her right upper flank when she became diaphoretic, pale, and passed out. According to her boyfriend, the patient slipped to the floor and her arms and legs moved in a jerky fashion for a few seconds. She regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately. She has no history of serious illness. She works as an event manager and has had more stress than usual due to a recent concert tour. She appears well. Her temperature is 37°C (98.4°F), pulse is 68/min, respirations are 16/min, and blood pressure is 120/72 mm Hg. Her cardiopulmonary examination shows no abnormalities. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. An ECG shows an incomplete right bundle branch block. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Vasovagal syncope
(B): Orthostatic syncope
(C): Tonic-clonic seizure
(D): Cardiac arrhythmia
(E): Cardiac structural abnormality
""
",Vasovagal syncope,Correct,"The correct answer is (A) Vasovagal syncope.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis for the patient's episode of loss of consciousness is vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope is a common cause of fainting and is often triggered by pain or emotional stress. In this case, the patient was being tattooed, which can be a painful experience for some individuals.

The prodrome of nausea and sweatiness, as well as the patient becoming diaphoretic and pale before passing out, are consistent with vasovagal syncope. The jerky movements of the arms and legs during the episode are also characteristic of vasovagal syncope.

The patient regained consciousness within half a minute and was alert and fully oriented immediately, which is typical of vasovagal syncope. In contrast, a seizure disorder would usually have a postictal confusion period lasting more than 5 minutes.

The patient's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure, are within normal limits. The absence of abnormalities on cardiopulmonary and neurologic examinations further supports the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope.

The presence of an incomplete right bundle branch block on the ECG is not directly related to the episode of loss of consciousness and is likely an incidental finding.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and absence of other significant findings, vasovagal syncope is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",
"A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department 1 hour after falling from his bicycle. The boy was racing with his cousin when he lost control and fell onto his right side. He has nausea and severe pain in the right shoulder. He is in acute distress. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 85/min, respirations are 15/min, and blood pressure is 135/85 mm Hg. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle and pain exacerbated by movement; range of motion is limited. The skin over the clavicle is intact. The radial pulse in the right arm is intact. Sensory examination of the right upper limb shows no abnormalities. An x‑ray of the chest is shown. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder?
Options:
(A): Perform tension banding
(B): Apply a clavicular plate
(C): Apply a simple shoulder sling
(D): Obtain an MRI of the right shoulder
(E): Perform arteriography
",Apply a simple shoulder sling,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Apply a simple shoulder sling.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient has fallen onto his right side and is experiencing severe pain in the right shoulder. Examination shows swelling and tenderness over the right clavicle, limited range of motion, and intact radial pulse in the right arm. These findings are consistent with a clavicle fracture.

The next step in management for this patient's shoulder is to apply a simple shoulder sling. A simple shoulder sling helps to immobilize the shoulder and clavicle, providing support and reducing pain. It allows for healing of the fracture by minimizing movement and preventing further injury.

Performing tension banding (A) or applying a clavicular plate (B) are not appropriate in this case as they are surgical interventions that are typically reserved for more severe or displaced clavicle fractures. In this case, the fracture is likely non-displaced and can be managed conservatively with a sling.

Obtaining an MRI of the right shoulder (D) is not necessary at this point as the diagnosis of a clavicle fracture can be made based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. MRI is typically reserved for cases where there is suspicion of associated soft tissue injuries or to evaluate the rotator cuff.

Performing arteriography (E) is not indicated in this case as the patient has an intact radial pulse in the right arm, indicating that there is no compromise to the blood supply. Arteriography is typically reserved for cases where there is concern for vascular injury or compromise.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management for this patient's shoulder is to apply a simple shoulder sling (C).",
"A 51-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of a 3-week history of abnormal behavior. His wife reports he has been preoccupied with gambling at the local casino. He becomes restless and irritable when his wife attempts to restrict his gambling. Four months ago, he was diagnosed with Parkinson disease and treatment was initiated. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the drug that was most likely prescribed for this patient?
Options:
(A): Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase
(B): Increase in availability of dopamine
(C): Direct activation of dopamine receptors
(D): Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B
(E): Inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase
",Direct activation of dopamine receptors,Correct,"The correct choice is (C): Direct activation of dopamine receptors.

Explanation:
The patient's abnormal behavior, preoccupation with gambling, restlessness, and irritability are suggestive of impulse control disorders, which can occur as a side effect of Parkinson disease treatment. Dopamine agonists, such as pramipexole or ropinirole, are commonly prescribed for Parkinson disease and can increase the risk of impulse control disorders, including compulsive gambling.

Dopamine agonists work by directly activating dopamine receptors in the brain. They mimic the action of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is deficient in Parkinson disease. By activating dopamine receptors, these medications help to alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease.

Peripheral inhibition of DOPA decarboxylase (choice A) is the mechanism of action of carbidopa, which is often used in combination with levodopa to enhance its effectiveness. Carbidopa inhibits the conversion of levodopa to dopamine in the peripheral tissues, allowing more levodopa to reach the brain.

Increasing the availability of dopamine (choice B) is the mechanism of action of levodopa, the mainstay of Parkinson disease treatment. Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the brain and helps to replenish the depleted dopamine levels.

Selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase B (choice D) is the mechanism of action of selegiline and rasagiline, which are used as adjunctive therapy in Parkinson disease. These medications inhibit the breakdown of dopamine by monoamine oxidase B, thereby increasing dopamine levels in the brain.

Inhibition of catechol-O-methyl transferase (choice E) is the mechanism of action of entacapone and tolcapone, which are used to prolong the duration of action of levodopa by inhibiting its breakdown. These medications do not directly activate dopamine receptors.",
"A 55-year-old woman with no significant past medical history presents to her primary care doctor with fever, fatigue, and bleeding gums for the past 3 days. She denies any sick contacts. Her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 96/min, and respirations are 15/min. Physical exam reveals several oral mucosal petechiae, bleeding gums, bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Initial laboratory workup shows the following:

Leukocyte count and differential:
Leukocyte count: 6,600/mm^3
Segmented neutrophils: 60%
Bands: 20%
Eosinophils: 9%
Basophils: 1%
Lymphocytes: 0%
Monocytes: 10%

A bone marrow biopsy demonstrates 34% myeloblasts with Auer rods that are myeloperoxidase positive. What is best treatment option?
Options:
(A): Ascorbic acid
(B): Cryoprecipitate
(C): Fresh frozen plasma
(D): Retinoic acid
(E): Zoledronic acid
",Retinoic acid,Correct,"The correct answer is (D) Retinoic acid.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation, laboratory findings, and bone marrow biopsy results are consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). APL is a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the presence of Auer rods and the t(15;17) translocation, which results in the fusion of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on chromosome 15 with the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RARα) gene on chromosome 17.

Retinoic acid (also known as all-trans retinoic acid or ATRA) is the treatment of choice for APL. It acts by binding to the abnormal RARα protein, causing differentiation of the leukemic cells and promoting their maturation into normal granulocytes. This leads to a decrease in the number of myeloblasts and an improvement in the patient's symptoms.

Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is not the appropriate treatment for APL. While vitamin C deficiency can cause bleeding gums and impaired wound healing, it does not address the underlying leukemic process.

Cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma are blood products that contain clotting factors and are used to treat bleeding disorders. However, in APL, the bleeding is primarily due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) caused by the release of procoagulant substances from the leukemic cells. Retinoic acid is the treatment of choice for APL-associated DIC.

Zoledronic acid is a bisphosphonate that is used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia of malignancy. It is not indicated for the treatment of APL.",
"A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency room complaining of malaise. Two hours prior to presentation, he developed muscle cramps and nausea. He has had 3 episodes of non-bloody watery stools since his symptoms started. He reports that he has experienced similar symptoms multiple times over the past 5 years since he started working at his local zoo as a reptilian caretaker. His medical history is unremarkable. He takes fish oil and a multivitamin daily. His temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), blood pressure is 130/90 mmHg, pulse is 90/min, and respirations are 17/min. On exam, he demonstrates sensitivity to bright light. He is tired-appearing but alert and fully oriented. A stool sample and culture demonstrates abundant non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli. The pathogen responsible for this patient’s condition relies on a virulence factor with which of the following mechanisms of action?
Options:
(A): ADP ribosylation of elongation factor 2
(B): Binding the Fc region of host immunoglobulins
(C): Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen
(D): Cleaving immunoglobulin A molecules
(E): Cleaving lecithin
",Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen.

The patient's symptoms, including malaise, muscle cramps, nausea, and watery stools, are consistent with gastroenteritis. The presence of non-lactose fermenting, oxidase-negative, and H2S-producing gram-negative bacilli in the stool sample suggests an infection with a pathogen that possesses certain virulence factors.

The O antigen is a component of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found on the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. It is an important target for the host immune system, as antibodies can bind to the O antigen and facilitate the clearance of the bacteria. However, some bacteria have developed mechanisms to evade this immune response.

In this case, the pathogen responsible for the patient's condition relies on a virulence factor that blocks antibody attack on the O antigen. By doing so, the bacteria can evade the host immune response and establish infection. This mechanism allows the bacteria to persist in the host and cause recurrent episodes of gastroenteritis, as seen in the patient's history.

Therefore, the correct answer is (C): Blocking antibody attack on the O antigen.",
"A 62-year-old man is brought to the physician by his wife because of difficulties walking for the past year. He has had multiple falls over the past 4 months. Over the past 6 months, he has had progressive urinary urgency and now wears an adult diaper as is not always able to control the urge to void. His appetite has also decreased in this time period. He used to drive, but his wife convinced him to stop after she noticed that he was becoming increasingly inattentive while driving. He has type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Current medications include ramipril and metformin. His temperature is 37.1C (98.8F), pulse is 90/min and blood pressure is 132/88 mm Hg. Examination shows a broad-based gait with slow and short steps. Neurologic examination shows no focal findings. On mental status examination, he is oriented to person and place but not to time. Attention and concentration are impaired. He recalls only one of three objects after 5 minutes. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Ventricular shunting
(B): Acetazolamide therapy
(C): Temporal lobectomy
(D): Donepezil therapy
(E): Sertraline therapy
",Ventricular shunting,Correct,"The correct choice is (A) Ventricular shunting.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). NPH is characterized by the triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. The broad-based gait with slow and short steps, along with the falls, is consistent with the gait disturbance seen in NPH. The urinary urgency and incontinence are also typical features of NPH. The cognitive impairment, including impaired attention and concentration, as well as the decreased appetite and impaired memory, further support the diagnosis.

Ventricular shunting is the most appropriate therapy for NPH. Ventricular shunting involves the placement of a catheter into the ventricles of the brain to divert the excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to another body cavity, such as the peritoneal cavity. This helps to relieve the symptoms of NPH by reducing the pressure on the brain caused by the accumulation of CSF.

Acetazolamide therapy (B) is not the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that can reduce CSF production and is used in the treatment of certain types of hydrocephalus. However, it is not the first-line treatment for NPH.

Temporal lobectomy (C) is not the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms. Temporal lobectomy is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the temporal lobe of the brain. It is typically used in the treatment of epilepsy and is not indicated for the symptoms described in this patient.

Donepezil therapy (D) is not the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms. Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. While this patient does have cognitive impairment, the symptoms are more consistent with NPH rather than Alzheimer's disease.

Sertraline therapy (E) is not the most appropriate therapy for this patient's symptoms. Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that is used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. While this patient may be experiencing some emotional distress related to his symptoms, the primary cause of his symptoms is likely NPH, and sertraline would not be the most appropriate treatment.",
"A 40-year-old woman with Down syndrome comes to the physician for the evaluation of fatigue, progressive clumsiness when using her hands, and difficulty walking for 3 months. During this period, the patient has had several episodes of dizziness as well as double vision. She also reports that she has lost control of her bladder on several occasions lately. She has not had any trauma or weight changes. She lives with her sister and works as a cashier in a local retail store. She takes no medications. Her vital signs are within normal limits. On mental status examination, she is oriented to person and place only. There is moderate weakness of the upper and lower extremities. Sensory examination shows no abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes are 3+ bilaterally. Babinski's sign is present bilaterally. Which of the following would most likely improve this patient's symptoms?
Options:
(A): Administration of botulism antitoxin
(B): Surgical fusion of C1/C2
(C): Administration of methylprednisolone
(D): Administration of donepezil
(E): Administration of pyridostigmine
""
",Surgical fusion of C1/C2,Correct,"The correct choice is (B) Surgical fusion of C1/C2.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fatigue, progressive clumsiness, difficulty walking, dizziness, double vision, and loss of bladder control, are suggestive of cervical myelopathy. Cervical myelopathy is a condition characterized by compression of the spinal cord in the neck region, often due to degenerative changes in the cervical spine. In patients with Down syndrome, atlantoaxial instability is a common cause of cervical myelopathy. Atlantoaxial instability refers to excessive movement between the first (C1) and second (C2) cervical vertebrae, which can lead to compression of the spinal cord.

Surgical fusion of C1/C2 is the most appropriate treatment for atlantoaxial instability in patients with Down syndrome. This procedure involves stabilizing the C1 and C2 vertebrae using screws and rods, which prevents excessive movement and reduces the risk of spinal cord compression. By addressing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, surgical fusion of C1/C2 is likely to improve her symptoms and prevent further progression of cervical myelopathy.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient's condition:
(A) Administration of botulism antitoxin: Botulism antitoxin is used to treat botulism, a rare condition caused by the toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with botulism, and this treatment would not address the underlying cause of her symptoms.
(C) Administration of methylprednisolone: Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to reduce inflammation. However, it is not indicated for the treatment of cervical myelopathy caused by atlantoaxial instability.
(D) Administration of donepezil: Donepezil is a medication used to treat Alzheimer's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with Alzheimer's disease, and this medication would not address the underlying cause of her symptoms.
(E) Administration of pyridostigmine: Pyridostigmine is a medication used to treat myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with myasthenia gravis, and this medication would not address the underlying cause of her symptoms.",
"A 74-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus is brought to her primary care doctor by her son who is concerned about the patient's ability to manage her activities of daily living. She has been living alone since her husband passed away 2 years ago. She has remained an active member of her retirement community's wine club; however, she stopped attending the meetings 3 weeks ago. She is generally able to her maintain her house, but her house appears more disorganized over the past 2 weeks. She generally drives short distances but avoids driving long distances as she occasionally gets lost when navigating new areas. She feels like her balance is getting worse, but she has not fallen. She has noticed increased urinary urgency over the past 8 months and has had 2 episodes of incontinence. Despite these changes, she reports feeling well. She drinks 4-6 glasses of wine per day. She was started on multiple medications for worsening anxiety by her psychiatrist 1 month ago. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. Her temperature is 99.8°F (37.7°C), blood pressure is 115/65 mmHg, pulse is 95/min, and respirations are 17/min. On examination, she is oriented to person and time but not place or situation. She does not seem to recognize her doctor despite knowing him for many years. She becomes somnolent intermittently throughout the interview. She can recall 0/3 words after 5 minutes. She has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm that increases in severity with deliberate movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?
Options:
(A): Alzheimer dementia
(B): Delirium
(C): Lewy body dementia
(D): Normal pressure hydrocephalus
(E): Pseudodementia
",Delirium,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Delirium.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is delirium. Delirium is an acute confusional state characterized by a disturbance in attention and awareness, which develops over a short period of time and fluctuates throughout the day. Delirium is often caused by an underlying medical condition or medication use. 

In this patient, there are several factors that suggest delirium. First, she has multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can increase the risk of delirium. Second, she has recently started multiple medications for worsening anxiety, which could contribute to the development of delirium. Third, she has a low-frequency tremor in her right arm, which could be a sign of delirium. Finally, she has cognitive impairment, as evidenced by her inability to recall words after 5 minutes and her difficulty recognizing her doctor, which are consistent with delirium.

Alzheimer dementia (A) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. While this patient has cognitive impairment, the acute onset and fluctuating course are more consistent with delirium.

Lewy body dementia (C) is a type of dementia characterized by cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and parkinsonism. While this patient has cognitive impairment and a tremor, the acute onset and fluctuating course are more consistent with delirium.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (D) is a condition characterized by gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive impairment. While this patient has urinary urgency and incontinence, the acute onset and fluctuating course are more consistent with delirium.

Pseudodementia (E) refers to a condition in which cognitive impairment mimics dementia but is actually caused by a psychiatric disorder, such as depression. While this patient has cognitive impairment, the acute onset and fluctuating course are more consistent with delirium. Additionally, her symptoms are not suggestive of depression.",
"A 45-year-old male with a history of diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension presents to his primary care physician for an annual check-up. He reports that he feels well and has no complaints. He takes enalapril and metformin. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C), blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 16/min. His physician adds another anti-hypertensive medication to the patient’s regimen. One month later, the patient returns to the physician complaining of new onset lower extremity swelling. Which of the following medications was likely prescribed to this patient?
Options:
(A): Metoprolol
(B): Verapamil
(C): Nifedipine
(D): Hydrochlorthiazide
(E): Spironolactone
",Nifedipine,Correct,"The correct answer is (C) Nifedipine.

Explanation:
Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker commonly used to treat hypertension. It works by blocking the influx of calcium into smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation and decreased peripheral vascular resistance. However, one of the side effects of nifedipine is peripheral edema, which can manifest as lower extremity swelling. This occurs due to the dilation of arterioles and increased capillary hydrostatic pressure, leading to fluid leakage into the interstitial space. 

In this case, the patient's blood pressure is poorly controlled despite being on enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Therefore, the physician likely added nifedipine to the patient's regimen to further lower his blood pressure. The new onset lower extremity swelling reported by the patient is a known side effect of nifedipine and is consistent with the mechanism of action of calcium channel blockers.",
"A 29-year-old woman comes to the physician with high-grade fever, headache, and muscle pain. A week ago, she returned from India, where she was working with an NGO to build houses in rural areas. The patient took one dose of chloroquine one week before her trip. She also took a further dose during her trip. She has no history of a serious illness. Her temperature is 39.3°C (102.7°F), pulse is 102/min, respirations are 22/min, and blood pressure is 112/78 mm Hg. Physical examination shows jaundice. The abdomen is soft and nontender. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Her hemoglobin concentration is 10 g/dL and a blood smear shows fragmented erythrocytes and occasional ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of infection in this patient?
Options:
(A): Plasmodium ovale
(B): Plasmodium falciparum
(C): Dengue virus
(D): Chikungunya virus
(E): Hepatitis A virus
",Plasmodium falciparum,Correct,"The correct answer is (B) Plasmodium falciparum.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including high-grade fever, headache, muscle pain, and jaundice, along with the history of travel to a malaria-endemic area (India), suggest a diagnosis of malaria. The blood smear showing fragmented erythrocytes and ring-shaped inclusion bodies within erythrocytes further supports this diagnosis. Among the options given, Plasmodium falciparum is the most likely cause of infection in this patient. Plasmodium falciparum is the most severe and potentially life-threatening species of malaria, commonly found in India and other parts of the world. It can cause severe complications such as cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, and abnormal bleeding. Treatment for Plasmodium falciparum infection typically involves antimalarial medications such as artemisinin-based combination therapy.",
"A 39-year-old woman presents to the clinic for her annual physical. Although she feels generally healthy she has noticed gaining about 9 kg (20 lb) over the last year. She eats a healthy, varied diet and exercises at the gym 4 days a week, including 20 minutes of aerobic exercise. On further questioning, she has also noted fatigue and constipation. She denies shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheadedness, or blood in her stool. At the clinic, the vital signs include: pulse 52/min, blood pressure 110/72 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation 99% on room air. The physical exam is notable only for slightly dry skin. The complete blood count (CBC) is within normal limits. Which of the following laboratory values is most likely elevated in this patient?
Options:
(A): Erythropoietin
(B): Glucose
(C): Triiodothyronine (T3)
(D): Thyroxine (T4)
(E): Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
",Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of weight gain, fatigue, constipation, and slightly dry skin are suggestive of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, leading to a decrease in the metabolic rate. This can result in weight gain, fatigue, constipation, and dry skin.

Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones. In cases of primary hypothyroidism, where the problem lies within the thyroid gland itself, the pituitary gland will produce more TSH in an attempt to stimulate the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormones. Therefore, in this patient with symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism, the most likely laboratory value to be elevated is TSH.

Erythropoietin (A) is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the production of red blood cells. It is not directly related to the symptoms described by the patient.

Glucose (B) is a measure of blood sugar levels and is not directly related to the symptoms described by the patient.

Triiodothyronine (T3) (C) and Thyroxine (T4) (D) are the two main thyroid hormones produced by the thyroid gland. In cases of primary hypothyroidism, the levels of T3 and T4 would be decreased, not elevated. Therefore, these options are not the most likely laboratory values to be elevated in this patient.",
"A 38-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent diarrhea and fatigue for 1 month. She has had up to 12 watery stools per day. Sometimes she awakens at night because she has to defecate. She has abdominal bloating and cramps. She has had a 2-kg weight loss in the past month. She returned from a trip to Costa Rica 7 weeks ago. She has a history of bronchial asthma and bulimia nervosa. She works as a nurse. She does not smoke and drinks 1–2 beers on the weekend. Current medications include fish oil, a multivitamin, and a salbutamol inhaler. Her temperature is 36.8°C (98.2°F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 100/75 mm Hg.

Abdominal ultrasound shows no abnormalities. Colonoscopy shows dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots. Biopsies of colonic mucosa are obtained and sent for pathological evaluation. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?""
Options:
(A): Celiac disease
(B): Carcinoid tumor
(C): VIPoma
(D): Irritable bowel syndrome
(E): Medication abuse
",Medication abuse,Correct,"The correct answer is (E) Medication abuse.

Explanation:
Based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms is medication abuse. The patient has persistent diarrhea, fatigue, abdominal bloating and cramps, and weight loss, which are all consistent with chronic diarrhea. The fact that she has up to 12 watery stools per day, sometimes waking up at night to defecate, suggests a significant bowel disturbance. Additionally, the dark colored mucosa with interspersed white spots seen on colonoscopy is concerning for drug-induced colitis.

The patient's history of bulimia nervosa is also relevant, as it is associated with laxative abuse. Laxative abuse can lead to chronic diarrhea and electrolyte imbalances, which are consistent with the patient's laboratory findings of low potassium (K+) and chloride (Cl-) levels. The dry mucous membranes seen on examination may also be a result of dehydration from chronic diarrhea.

The other options listed (A: Celiac disease, B: Carcinoid tumor, C: VIPoma, D: Irritable bowel syndrome) are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings. Celiac disease typically presents with chronic diarrhea, but it is also associated with weight loss, anemia, and malabsorption of nutrients. Carcinoid tumors and VIPomas can cause chronic diarrhea, but they are less likely given the absence of other associated symptoms such as flushing or hormonal abnormalities. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a diagnosis of exclusion and typically presents with abdominal pain and altered bowel habits, but it is less likely to cause persistent diarrhea and weight loss.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and history of bulimia nervosa, medication abuse is the most likely underlying cause of her symptoms. It is important to further investigate and address the potential medication abuse in order to provide appropriate treatment and support for the patient.",
"A 21-year-old college student comes to the physician because of daytime fatigue for 2 months. He has problems getting to sleep at night and frequently falls asleep during class. Recently he has started skipping classes altogether. He goes to bed between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. but cannot fall asleep for 2–3 hours. When he wakes up at 8:30 a.m., he feels extremely drowsy, and he tries to overcome his fatigue by drinking 2–3 cups of coffee a day. He naps at various times during the afternoon, often for more than an hour. He stopped watching videos on his smartphone at night because of suggestions from his peers. He states that he has tried over-the-counter melatonin pills and exercising at 8 p.m. without success. He has no history of serious illness. He does not smoke. He drinks three to five beers on weekends. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation for this patient?
Options:
(A): Trial of diphenhydramine
(B): Complete caffeine cessation
(C): Stop evening exercise
(D): Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime
(E): Scheduled afternoon naps
",Stop evening exercise,Correct,"The correct answer is (C): Stop evening exercise.

Explanation:
Based on the information provided, the patient is experiencing daytime fatigue, difficulty falling asleep at night, and excessive daytime sleepiness. These symptoms are consistent with delayed sleep-wake phase disorder (DSWPD), which is characterized by a delayed sleep-wake schedule that is misaligned with societal norms.

The most appropriate recommendation for this patient is to stop evening exercise. Exercise can increase alertness and body temperature, making it more difficult to fall asleep. By stopping evening exercise, the patient can help promote relaxation and prepare their body for sleep.

Other recommendations for DSWPD include maintaining a consistent sleep-wake time, avoiding daytime naps, refraining from stimulating activities before bedtime, avoiding sleeping in on weekends, and gradually advancing evening bedtimes and morning wake times toward a targeted goal.

Complete caffeine cessation (B) may be recommended for some patients with sleep disorders, but in this case, the patient is using caffeine to combat daytime fatigue. It would be more appropriate to gradually reduce caffeine intake rather than completely stopping it.

Alcoholic beverage prior to bedtime (D) is not recommended as it can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to poor sleep quality.

Scheduled afternoon naps (E) should be avoided in patients with DSWPD as they can further disrupt the sleep-wake schedule and make it more difficult to fall asleep at night.

Therefore, the most appropriate recommendation for this patient is to stop evening exercise (C).",
"A 19-year-old man is brought to the physician by his mother because she is worried about his strange behavior. Over the past 3 years, he has been dressing all in black and wears a long black coat, even in the summer. The mother reports that her son has always had difficulties fitting in. He does not have any friends and spends most of his time in his room playing online games. He is anxious at college because he is uncomfortable around other people, and his academic performance is poor. Rather than doing his coursework, he spends most of his time reading up on paranormal phenomena, especially demons. He says that he has never seen any demons, but sometimes there are signs of their presence. For example, a breeze in an enclosed room is likely the “breath of a demon”. Mental status examination shows laborious speech. The patient avoids eye contact. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Social anxiety disorder
(B): Avoidant personality disorder
(C): Schizotypal personality disorder
(D): Paranoid personality disorder
(E): Schizophrenia
",Schizotypal personality disorder,Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Schizotypal personality disorder.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and behaviors are consistent with schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior, odd beliefs or magical thinking, and difficulties with social relationships. The patient's dressing in all black and wearing a long black coat, as well as his preoccupation with paranormal phenomena, are examples of eccentric behavior. His belief that a breeze in an enclosed room is the ""breath of a demon"" demonstrates odd beliefs or magical thinking. His difficulties fitting in, lack of friends, and discomfort around other people are indicative of difficulties with social relationships. The patient's laborious speech and avoidance of eye contact are also consistent with schizotypal personality disorder.",
"A 79-year-old man presents to the office due to shortness of breath with moderate exertion and a slightly productive cough. He has a medical history of 25 years of heavy smoking. His vitals include: heart rate 89/min, respiratory rate 27/min, and blood pressure 120/90 mm Hg. The physical exam shows increased resonance to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and crackles at the lung base. Chest radiography shows signs of pulmonary hyperinflation. Spirometry shows a forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 48%, a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 85%, and an FEV1/FVC ratio of 56%. According to these results, what is the most likely diagnosis?
Options:
(A): Asthma
(B): Lymphangioleiomyomatosis
(C): Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
(D): Bronchiectasis
(E): Heart failure
",Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),Correct,"The correct choice is (C) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Explanation:
The patient's history of heavy smoking, along with the symptoms of shortness of breath and productive cough, are suggestive of a chronic lung disease. The physical exam findings of increased resonance to percussion, decreased breath sounds, and crackles at the lung base further support a diagnosis of COPD.

Chest radiography showing signs of pulmonary hyperinflation is consistent with COPD, as hyperinflation occurs due to air trapping in the lungs. This is a characteristic finding in patients with COPD.

Spirometry results are also indicative of COPD. The forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) of 48% and the forced vital capacity (FVC) of 85% suggest airflow limitation. The FEV1/FVC ratio of 56% is reduced, indicating an obstructive pattern of lung disease.

Asthma (option A) is a possibility, but the patient's age, heavy smoking history, and the presence of crackles on physical exam make COPD a more likely diagnosis.

Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (option B) is a rare lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. It is not typically associated with a history of heavy smoking or crackles on physical exam.

Bronchiectasis (option D) is characterized by permanent dilation of the bronchi and is often associated with chronic infections. While it can cause symptoms similar to COPD, the spirometry results in this patient are more consistent with COPD.

Heart failure (option E) can cause shortness of breath, but the physical exam findings and spirometry results in this patient are not consistent with heart failure. Additionally, the patient's heavy smoking history makes COPD a more likely diagnosis.",
